J	Yao, MQ; Zhang, LB				Yao, Mao-qun; Zhang, Li-bin			Emitter-couple logic circuit design based on the threshold-arithmetic algebraic system	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						Threshold-arithmetic algebraic system; HE map; ECL circuit; Current-mode circuits		Based on the threshold-arithmetic algebraic system which has been proposed for current-mode circuit design, we propose a systematic methodology for emitter-couple logic (ECL) circuit design. Compared to the traditional methodologies and the theory of differential current switches, the proposed methodology uses the HE map and the characteristics of the internal current signals of ECL circuits to determine the external voltage signals. The operations of the HE map are direct and simple, and the current signals are easy to add or subtract, which make this methodology more flexible, direct, and effective, and make it possible to design arbitrary binary and multi-valued logic functions. Two example circuits are designed and simulated by HSPICE using 0.18 mu m TSMC technology. Simulation results confirm the validity of the proposed methodology.

Background.Knowledge is necessary for skilled pain assessment among nurses. Little is currently known regarding knowledge, attitude toward, and self reported pain assessment by nurses from Mainland China. Methods.Quantitative research and cross-sectional convenience sampling assessed nursing knowledge, attitude, and practice among 101 nurses working in high-level hospitals in Mainland China. Results.81.2% of nurses participating in the survey were from high-level (level three) hospitals in Mainland China. 24.8% of the nurses attended continuing education in pain assessment. No nurses from the 76 hospital staffs surveyed were able to recall any hospital policy regarding pain assessment. Knowledge regarding pain assessment was rated at 1.9 (SD=1.6) on a (0-7) scale. 27.7% of nurses possessed a positive attitude toward pain assessment. Pain assessment was not routine in most of the hospitals surveyed. Nurses who attended continuing education showed greater knowledge and more positive attitudes regarding pain assessment but did not show improvement in their quality of practice. Conclusions.This study identified inadequate knowledge and low level of self-reported pain assessment practice among nurses working in high-level hospitals in Mainland China. Current education did not influence nursing self-reported pain assessment practice. Knowledge of pain evaluation should be improved through newer approaches to education. A better policy framework for pain evaluation may also contribute to improvement.

The expressed PLCE1 in ESCC, however, are inconsistent. This study examined PLCE1 expression by immunohistochemistry (IHC) from 110 ethnic Kazakh ESCC patients and 50 from adjacent normal esophageal tissues (NETs). The expressed PLCE1 was localized in cytoplasm, especially in the peripheral layers of cancer cell nests, which was significantly higher in tumors than in NETs (p<0.001). Increased expression of PLCE1 was correlated with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages (p=0.015) and lymph node metastasis (p=0.003) in patients with ESCC. Of the 110 patients, we examined 50 paired ESCC tissues and corresponding NETs by quantitative RT-PCR (polymerase chain reaction) and the mean mRNA level of PLCE1 in ESCC was 1.85-fold higher compared with those in corresponding NETs (p=0.0012). Meanwhile, 4 of 5 ESCC cell lines also showed elevated expression of PLCE1mRNA. Furthermore, elevated expression of PLCE1mRNA in Kazakh ESCC was associated with its immunoreactivity (=0.297, p=0.040), lymph node metastasis (p<0.001), and advanced TNM stages of ESCC (p=0.013). To our knowledge, this study demonstrates for the first time that PLCE1 overexpression correlates with lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages of Kazakh ESCC, implicating a role of PLCE1 in cancer metastasis and aggressiveness in ethnic Kazakh patients with ESCC. Furthermore, the current findings may warrant investigations into whether inhibiting PLCE1 could be a strategy for targeted anticancer therapy particularly for Kazakh ESCC.

NO3-N sources in the East Tiaoxi River of the Yangtze Delta Region were investigated by applying a N-15-O-18 dual isotope approach. Water samples were collected from the main channel and from the tributaries. Results show that high total N and NO3-N are present in both the main channel and the major tributaries, and NO3-N was one of the most important N forms in water. Analysis of isotopic compositions (delta O-18, delta D) of water suggests that the river water mainly originated from three tributaries during the sampling period. There was a wide range of delta N-15-NO3 (-1.4 to 12.4 aEuro degrees) and a narrow range of delta O-18-NO3 (3.7 to 9.0 aEuro degrees) in the main channel waters. The delta N-15 and delta O-18-NO3 values in the upper, middle, and lower channels along the river were shifted as 8.2, 3.5, and 9.5 aEuro degrees, and 9.0, 4.2, and 6.0 aEuro degrees, respectively. In the tributary South Tiao, the delta N-15 and delta O-18-NO3 values were as high as 9.5 and 7.0 aEuro degrees, while in the tributaries Mid Tiao and North Tiao, NO3-N in most of the samples had relatively low delta N-15 and delta O-18-NO3 values from 2.3 to 7.5 aEuro degrees and 4.7 to 7.0 aEuro degrees, separately. Our results also suggest that the dual isotope approach can help us develop the best management practice for relieving NO3-N pollution in the rivers at the tributary scale.	[Liang, X. Q.; Nie, Z.

Whether they can complementarily reveal brain regional functional abnormalities in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) remains unknown. In this study, we applied ReHo and ALFF to 23 medication-na < ve boys diagnosed with ADHD and 25 age-matched healthy male controls using whole-brain voxel-wise analysis. Correlation analyses were conducted in the ADHD group to investigate the relationship between the regional spontaneous brain activity measured by the two approaches and the clinical symptoms of ADHD. We found that the ReHo method showed widely-distributed differences between the two groups in the fronto-cingulo-occipito-cerebellar circuitry, while the ALFF method showed a difference only in the right occipital area. When a larger smoothing kernel and a more lenient threshold were used for ALFF, more overlapped regions were found between ALFF and ReHo, and ALFF even found some new regions with group differences. The ADHD symptom scores were correlated with the ReHo values in the right cerebellum, dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left lingual gyrus in the ADHD group, while no correlation was detected between ALFF and ADHD symptoms. In conclusion, ReHo may be more sensitive to regional abnormalities, at least in boys with ADHD, than ALFF. And ALFF may be complementary to ReHo in measuring local spontaneous activity. Combination of the two may yield a more comprehensive pathophy-siological framework for ADHD.

This study sought to explore gray matter structure in patients with treatment-refractory OCD and compare it with that of healthy controls. Methods: A total of 18 subjects with treatment-refractory OCD and 26 healthy volunteers were analyzed by MRI using a 3.0-T scanner and voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Diffeomorphic anatomical registration using exponentiated Lie algebra (DARTEL) was used to identify structural changes in gray matter associated with treatment-refractory OCD. A partial correlation model was used to analyze whether morphometric changes were associated with Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale scores and illness duration. Results: Gray matter volume did not differ significantly between the two groups. Treatment-refractory OCD patients showed significantly lower gray matter density than healthy subjects in the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and significantly higher gray matter density in the left dorsal striatum (putamen). These changes did not correlate with symptom severity or illness duration. Conclusions: Our findings provide new evidence of deficits in gray matter density in treatment-refractory OCD patients. These patients may show characteristic density abnormalities in the left PCC, MD and dorsal striatum (putamen), which should be verified in longitudinal studies. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

The formulation is essentially non-Markovian and incorporates the interplay of the multi-tunneling processes and many-body correlations. The proposed n-SCBA-ME goes beyond the scope of the Born-Markov master equation, being applicable to transport under small bias voltage, in non-Markovian regime and with strong Coulomb correlations. For steady state, it can recover not only the exact result of noninteracting transport under arbitrary voltages, but also the challenging nonequilibrium Kondo effect. Moreover, the n-SCBA-ME approach is efficient for the study of shot noise. We demonstrate the application by a couple of representative examples, including particularly the nonequilibrium Kondo system.

However, oil content is a complex quantitative trait. QTL mapping in a double haploid population (SG population) emerging from a cross between a German (Sollux) and Chinese (Gaoyou) cultivars revealed one QTL for oil content on linkage group A1 (OilA1), which was mapped to a 17 cM genetic interval. To further validate and characterize the OilA1, we constructed a high-resolution map using B. rapa sequence resources and developed a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) by employing a DH line SG-DH267 as donor and Chinese parent Gaoyou as recurrent background. The results showed highly conserved synteny order between B. rapa and B. napus within the linkage group A1 and revealed a possible centromere region between two markers ZAASA1-38 and NTP3 (2.5 cM). OilA1 was firstly validated by 250 BC5F2 plants and was confirmed in a 10.6 cM interval between the markers ZAASA1-47 and ZAASA1-77. Further substitution mapping was conducted by using two generations of QTL-NILs, 283 lines from eight BC5F3:4 families and 428 plants from six BC5F4 sub-NILs and thus narrowed the OilA1 interval to 6.9 cM and 4.3 cM (1.4 Mb), respectively. Field investigations with two replications using homozygous BC5F3:4 sister sub-NILs indicated that NILs, which carry a Sollux chromosome segment across the target region showed significant higher oil content (1.26 %, p < 0.001) than their sister NILs containing Gaoyou chromosome. The OilA1 locus is of particular interest for breeding purpose in China because 80 % of Chinese cultivars do not carry this desirable allele.

Two-dimensional (2D) planar graphene powder was utilized as the solid-phase extraction (SPE) sorbent for analyte enrichment and cleanup. The target analytes were separated by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography (LC) and quantified by a triple-quadrupole linear ion trap mass spectrometer. The proposed analytical procedures were carefully optimized and validated. Average recoveries of MLs were between 81.7 and 110.5 %, which was the highest comparing with the conventional sorbents including C18 silica and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). Method validation proved the feasibility of the developed nanoparticles for the quantificatation of the investigated analytes at trace levels obtaining low limit of quantitation values in the microgram per kilogram range. Good precision with coefficients of variations always lower than 10 % was obtained. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of ML in several aquaculture product samples, indicating that graphene was a potential SPE sorbent for the enrichment of trace residues in food samples.

Construction of a Sonchus Yellow Net Virus Minireplicon: a Step toward Reverse Genetic Analysis of Plant Negative-Strand RNA Viruses	JOURNAL OF VIROLOGY			English	Article							VESICULAR STOMATITIS-VIRUS; STRIPE-MOSAIC-VIRUS; DEFECTIVE INTERFERING PARTICLES; CLONED CDNA; NUCLEAR VIROPLASMS; PROTEIN GENE; GENOMIC RNA; N-PROTEIN; REPLICATION; EXPRESSION	Reverse genetic analyses of negative-strand RNA (NSR) viruses have provided enormous advances in our understanding of animal viruses over the past 20 years, but technical difficulties have hampered application to plant NSR viruses. To develop a reverse genetic approach for analysis of plant NSR viruses, we have engineered Sonchus yellow net nucleorhabdovirus (SYNV) minireplicon (MR) reporter cassettes for Agrobacterium tumefaciens expression in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves. Fluorescent reporter genes substituted for the SYNV N and P protein open reading frames (ORFs) exhibited intense single-cell foci throughout regions of infiltrated leaves expressing the SYNV MR derivatives and the SYNV nucleocapsid (N), phosphoprotein (P), and polymerase (L) proteins. Genomic RNA and mRNA transcription was detected for reporter genes substituted for both the SYNV N and P ORFs. These activities required expression of the N, P, and L core proteins in trans and were enhanced by codelivery of viral suppressor proteins that interfere with host RNA silencing. As is the case with other members of the Mononegavirales, we detected polar expression of fluorescent proteins and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase substitutions for the N and P protein ORFs. We also demonstrated the utility of the SYNV MR system for functional analysis of SYNV core proteins in trans and the cis-acting leader and trailer sequence requirements for transcription and replication. This work provides a platform for construction of more complex SYNV reverse genetic derivatives and presents a general strategy for reverse genetic applications with other plant NSR viruses.

However, because this dataset was acquired only from a single group under a single condition, we cannot directly evaluate whether the rs-fMRI measures can generate reproducible between-condition or between-group results. Because the modulation of resting state activity has gained increasing attention, it is important to know whether one rs-fMRI metric can reliably detect the alteration of the resting activity. Here, we shared a public Eyes-Open (EO)/Eyes-Closed (EC) dataset for evaluating the split-half reproducibility of the rs-fMRI measures in detecting changes of the resting state activity between EO and EC. As examples, we assessed the split-half reproducibility of three widely applied rs-fMRI metrics: amplitude of low frequency fluctuation, regional homogeneity, and seed-based correlation analysis. Our results demonstrated that reproducible patterns of EO-EC differences can be detected by all three measures, suggesting the feasibility of the EO/EC dataset for performing reproducibility assessment for other rs-fMRI measures.

Calcium-dependent autophosphorylation is central to the regulation of CCaMK, and this has been shown to promote calmodulin binding. Here, we report a regulatory mechanism of Medicago truncatula CCaMK (MtCCaMK) through autophosphorylation of S344 in the calmodulin-binding/autoinhibitory domain. The phospho-ablative mutation S344A did not have significant effect on its kinase activities, and supports root nodule symbiosis and arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis, indicating that phosphorylation at this position is not required for establishment of symbioses. The phospho-mimic mutation S344D show drastically reduced calmodulin-stimulated substrate phosphorylation, and this coincides with a compromised interaction with calmodulin and its interacting partner, IPD3. Functional complementation tests revealed that the S344D mutation blocked root nodule symbiosis and reduced the mycorrhizal association. Furthermore, S344D was shown to suppress the spontaneous nodulation associated with a gain-of-function mutant of MtCCaMK (T271A), revealing that phosphorylation at S344 of MtCCaMK is adequate for shutting down its activity, and is epistatic over previously identified T271 autophosphorylation. These results reveal a mechanism that enables CCaMK to turn off' its function through autophosphorylation.	[Routray, Pratyush; Du, Liqun; Poovaiah, B.

Here we report that the Nicotiana benthamiana J-domain MIP1 proteins (NbMIP1s) associate with tobamovirus MP, Tm-2(2) and SGT1. Silencing of NbMIP1s reduced TMV movement and compromised Tm-2(2)-mediated resistance against TMV and ToMV. Furthermore, silencing of NbMIP1s reduced the steady-state protein levels of ToMV MP and Tm-2(2). Moreover, NbMIP1s are required for plant resistance induced by other R genes and the nonhost pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) DC3000. In addition, we found that SGT1 associates with Tm-2(2) and is required for Tm-2(2)-mediated resistance against TMV. These results suggest that NbMIP1s function as co-chaperones during virus infection and plant immunity.

The health risk assessment methods developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) were employed to explore the potential health hazards of heavy metals in soils growing vegetables. Results showed that heavy metal contaminations in investigated vegetables and corresponding soils were significant Pollution levels varied with metals and vegetable types. The highest mean soil concentrations of heavy metals were 70.36 mg kg(-1) Pb, 47.49 mg kg(-1) Cr, 13.51 mg kg(-1) As, 0.73 mg kg(-1) for Cd and 0.67 mg kg(-1) Hg, respectively, while the metal concentrations in vegetables and corresponding soils were poorly correlated. The health risk assessment results indicated that diet dominated the exposure pathways, so heavy metals in soil samples might cause potential harm through food-chain transfer. The total non-cancer and cancer risk results indicated that the investigated arable fields near industrial and waste mining sites were unsuitable for growing leaf and root vegetables in view of the risk of elevated intakes of heavy metals adversely affecting food safety for local residents. Chromium and Pb were the primary heavy metals posing non-cancer risks while Cd caused the greatest cancer risk. It was concluded that more effective controls should be focused on Cd and Cr to reduce pollution in this study area. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With the proper construction of subspaces based on the knowledge of the boundary deformation, we can use the Lagrange multiplier technique to impose coupling constraints at the boundary without overconstraining. In our deformation algorithm, the number of constraint equations to couple two neighboring domains is not related to the number of the nodes on the boundary but is the same as the number of the selected boundary deformation modes. The crack artifact is not present in our simulation result, and the domain decomposition with loops can be easily handled. Experimental results show that the single-core implementation of our algorithm can achieve real-time performance in simulating deformable objects with around quarter million tetrahedral elements.

The measurement losses of the communicated information are considered in an unreliable communication channel. The robust H-infinity dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to handle the measurement losses and mitigate the quantization effects such that the resultant closed-loop NCS is mean-square stochastically stable with a prescribed H-infinity disturbance attenuation performance. The controller existence conditions can be derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Finally, an example is provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

However, these conclusions are based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of alphabetic language processing, languages that have clear grapheme-to-phoneme correspondence (GPC) rules that make it difficult to disassociate visual-specific processing from form-to-sound mapping. In contrast, the Chinese language has no clear GPC rules. Therefore, the current study examined whether native Chinese readers also have the same VWFA and multimodal area. Two cross-modal tasks, phonological retrieval of visual words and orthographic retrieval of auditory words, were adopted. Different task requirements were also applied to explore how different levels of cognitive processing modulate activation of putative VWFA-like and multimodal-like regions. Results showed that the left occipitotemporal sulcus (LOTS) responded exclusively to visual inputs and an adjacent region, the left inferior temporal gyrus (LITG), showed comparable activation for both visual and auditory inputs. Surprisingly, processing levels did not significantly alter activation of these two regions. These findings indicated that there are both unimodal and multimodal word areas for non-alphabetic language reading, and that activity in these two word-specific regions are independent of task demands at the linguistic level.

Both Tp and CTMax were highest in P. versicolor and lowest in P. vlangalii, with P. guinanensis in between. The two viviparous species did not differ in CTMin and thermal tolerance range, and they both were more resistant to low temperatures and had a wider range of thermal tolerance than the oviparous species. Both CTMin and CTMax shifted upward as acclimation temperature increased in all the three species. Tp was higher in the lizards acclimated to 33 C than in those to 28 degrees C or 38 degrees C. The range of thermal tolerance was wider in the lizards acclimated to 28 degrees C than in those to 33 degrees C or 38 degrees C. The data showed that: 1) thermal preference and tolerance were affected by acclimation temperature, and differed among the three species of PhrynocephaIus lizards with different body sizes and habitat uses; 2) both Tp and CTMax were higher in the species exchanging heat more rapidly with the environment, and CTMin was higher in the species using warmer habitats during the active season; and 3) thermal preference and tolerance might correlat with body size and habitat use in Phrynocephalus lizards.

As a result, there are still discrepancies on their phase diagrams. In this paper, we report the synthesis of Fe1+delta Te1-xSx (0 <= x <= 0.12) single crystals by a melting method. Superconductivity was greatly improved after air annealing by which we partially removed the excess Fe atoms. Based on the resistivity and susceptibility measurements, we concluded a phase diagram of the Fe1+delta Te1-xSx (0 <= x <= 0.12) system with fewer excess iron atoms. We found a coexisting region (0.07 <= x <= 0.11) of antiferromagnetic order and bulk superconductivity. This phase diagram is similar to that of the K- or Co-doped BaFe2As2 system, as well as the Fe(Te, Se) system, implying a commonality of the iron-based superconductors.

It has been reported that more than one miRNA/miRNA* duplex could be produced from a microRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). In this study, we performed a comprehensive search for the novel miRNA candidates on the pre-miRNAs of Arabidopsis. AGO1 enrichment, co-existence of the miRNA*-like coordinates, and unique genome-wide match sites were taken into consideration for candidate screening. As a result, 43 miRNA-like candidates derived from 25 pre-miRNAs were identified. Among these candidates, 31 strong candidates from 22 pre-miRNAs passed all the filtering steps. Interestingly, some of these miRNA-like candidates showed organ-specific expression patterns. After target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, five miRNA candidate-target pairs (ath-miR863-5p.2-AT1G76550.1, ath-miR822,2-AT5G03552.1, ath-miR822.3-AT5G02350.1, sRNA4-AT1G66290.1 and sRNA6-AT1G66310.1) were identified, providing a basis for in-depth functional analysis of these miRNA candidates. These results could update the current understanding of the biogenesis and the action of the plant miRNAs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Hierarchical Self-Assembly: Well-Defined Supramolecular Nanostructures and Metallohydrogels via Amphiphilic Discrete Organoplatinum(II) Metallacycles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							BUILDING-BLOCKS; DESIGN; POLYMER; LIGANDS; PACKING; WATER	Metallacyclic cores provide a scaffold upon which pendant functionalities can be organized to direct the formation of dimensionally controllable nanostructures. Because of the modularity of coordination-driven self-assembly, the properties of a given supramolecular core can be readily tuned, which has a significant effect on the resulting nanostructured material. Herein we report the efficient preparation of two amphiphilic rhomboids that can subsequently order into 0D micelles, ID nanofibers, or 2D nanoribbons. This structural diversity is enforced by three parameters: the nature of the hydrophilic moieties decorating the parent rhomboids, the concentration of precursors during self-assembly, and the reaction duration. These nanoscopic constructs further interact to generate metallohydrogels at high concentrations, driven by intermolecular hydrophobic and pi-pi interactions, demonstrating the utility of coordination-driven self-assembly as a first-order structural element for the hierarchical design of functional soft materials.

For the first time, by complexing with the mobile phase containing 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate into negatively charged complexes, fast separation of inorganic mercury (Hg2+), monomethylmercury (MeHg), ethylmercury (EtHg) and phenylmercury (PhHg) was achieved within 5 min on a 12.5-mm strong anion exchange column. The detection limits for Hg2+, MeHg, EtHg and PhHg were 0.008, 0.024, 0.029 and 0.034 mu g L-1, respectively. The relative standard deviations of peak height and peak area (5.0 mu g L-1 for each Hg species) were all below 3%. The determined contents of Hg2+, MeHg and total Hg in a certified reference material of fish tissue by the proposed method were in good accordance with the certified values with satisfactory recoveries. The relative errors for determining MeHg and total mercury were -2.4% and -1.2%, respectively, with an acceptable range for spike recoveries of 94-101%. Mercury speciation in 11 fish samples were then analyzed after the pretreated procedure. The mercury contents in all fish samples analyzed were found compliant with the criteria of the National Standards of China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Supramolecular polymers with tunable topologies via hierarchical coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding interfaces	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article							COMPLEXES; DESIGN	A powerful strategy to obtain complex supramolecular materials is the bottom-up construction of noncovalently bound materials by hierarchical self-assembly. This assembly process involves step-wise, uniform increases to the architectural complexity of a substrate, starting from discrete precursors and growing in dimensionality through controlled reactivity to a final product. Herein, two orthogonal processes are exploited: coordination-driven self-assembly and hydrogen bonding. The former relies on the predictable formation of metal-ligand bonds wherein the directionalities of the rigid precursors used determines the structural outcome. The latter uses 2-ureido-4-pyrimidinone interfaces that are structurally robust by virtue of the quadruple hydrogen bonding that can occur between subunits. By combining these two processes into a single system, it is possible to generate hierarchical materials that preserve the attractive tunability associated with discrete supramolecular coordination complexes. For instance, the synthesis of a one-dimensional chain comprising linked metalla-rhomboids is readily adapted to a 2D cross-linked hexagonal network by simply selecting a different metal acceptor precursor as an assembly component. The specific interactions between subunits, in this case platinum(II)-pyridyl bonds and the quadruple H-bonding of ureidopyrimidinone, are unchanged, establishing a unique strategy to obtain supramolecular polymers with marked topological differences with minimal synthetic redesign. In addition, the structural rigidity imposed by the inclusion of the platinum metallacycles serves to minimize the formation of cyclic oligomers, increasing the efficacy of formation and improving the properties of the resultant materials. Furthermore, this study taps the potential of organoplatinum(II) metallacycles in materials science.

In this study, we calculated the CpG odds ratio of all RNA viruses that have available genome sequences and analyzed the correlation with their genome polarity, base composition, synonymous codon usage, phylogenetic relationship, and host. The results indicated that the viral base composition, synonymous codon usage and host selection were the dominant factors that determined the CpG bias in RNA viruses. CpG usage variation between the different viral groups was caused by different combinations of these pressures, which also differed from each other in strength. The consistent under-representation of CpG usage in -ssRNA viruses is determined predominantly by base composition, which may be a consequence of the U/A preferred mutation bias of -ssRNA viruses, whereas the CpG usage of +ssRNA viruses is affected greatly by their hosts. As a result, most +ssRNA viruses mimic their hosts' CpG usage. Unbiased CpG usage in dsRNA viruses is most likely a result of their dsRNA genome, which allows the viruses to escape from the host-driven CpG elimination pressure. CpG was under-represented in all reverse-transcribing viruses (RT viruses), suggesting that DNA methylation is an important factor affecting the CpG usage of retroviruses. However, vertebrate-infecting RT viruses may also suffer host' CpG elimination pressure that also acts on +ssRNA viruses, which results in further under-representation of CpG in the vertebrate-infecting RT viruses.

Effective therapy for NASH is still lacking. In this study, we investigated the effects of Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) in the treatment of NASH. Methods: Western and Chinese databases were searched by independent investigators using appropriate MESH headings to identify randomized, controlled Western and Chinese clinical trials, published between January 1990 and October 2012, testing the effects of UDCA in patients with NASH. Patient characteristics and trial endpoints were analyzed, with quality assessment according to widely acknowledged criteria. P < 0.05 was defined as statistically significant in all trials. Results: Twelve qualified randomized clinical trials, including six from China and involving 1160 subjects, were selected. Seven of these trials assessed the effects of UDCA Monotherapy, with the other five testing combinations of UDCA with vitamin E, polyene phosphatidylcholine, silymarin, glycyrrhizin and tiopronin. The duration of therapy ranged from 3 to 24 months, with two studies using high doses of UDCA (23-35 mg/kg/d). The average quality point was 2.69, and was significantly lower in articles from China than in those from Western countries (2.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 3.8 +/- 1.1, respectively, p < 0.05). UDCA Monotherapy significantly improved liver function in five studies and improved steatosis and fibrosis in two studies. All five studies assessing UDCA combination therapy showed significant improvements liver function, while two studies also improved steatosis and inflammation. One study of high-dose UDCA showed significant improvements in ALT, gamma GT and liver fibrosis, whereas the other study showed no significant change in ALT and liver pathology. Conclusions: UDCA therapy is effective in NASH, especially when combined with other drugs. However, the low quality of these studies and the heterogeneity of their results precluded further meta-analysis. Additional carefully designed clinical trials are needed, especially in China.

The proportions of each compost in the mixtures elaborated with peat were 50%, 75%, and 100% (v/v), respectively. The substrate of 100% commercial peat was used as the control. First, some physical, physical-chemical, and chemical properties of these substrates were determined. Second, four kinds of plants tomato, cucumber, bermudagrass, and impatiens were used to evaluate the possibility of different composts to replace part of peat. The seed germination rate, fresh weight and nutrient concentrations of seedling were then measured. We found that the physical, physical-chemical and chemical properties of these substrates were statistically influenced by the type and the proportion of compost in the substrates. The substrates elaborated with C1 and C2 showed adequate physical and chemical properties for their use as substrate in horticultural seedlings production. The highest germination of cucumber, tomato, bermudagrass and impatiens all occurred at C1 based substrate. Seedling grown in the C1 and C2 based substrate reached better growth and nutrition than peat. Our results suggested that the C1 and C2 were good alternative to peat-based substrate for seedling production, especially at the rate of 75% and 100% of C1 and 50% of C2, which have shown beneficial effects on the seedling production of cucumber, tomato, bermudagrass and impatiens compared to the control. However, C3 and C4 were not always adequately used in substituting expensive peat.

According to the direct travel diaries of volunteers, we show the absence of scaling properties in the displacement distribution at the individual level, while the aggregated displacement distribution follows a power law with an exponential cutoff. Given the constraint on total travelling cost, this aggregated scaling law can be analytically predicted by the mixture nature of human travel under the principle of maximum entropy. A direct corollary of such theory is that the displacement distribution of a single mode of transportation should follow an exponential law, which also gets supportive evidences in known data.

DYNAMIC EXPRESSION OF SECRETED FRIZZLED-RELATED PROTEIN 3 (sFRP3) IN THE DEVELOPING MOUSE SPINAL CORD AND DORSAL ROOT GANGLIA	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						secreted Frizzled-related protein 3; spinal cord; dorsal root ganglia sensory circuit	NERVOUS-SYSTEM; WNT; FAMILY; TISSUE; FRZB-1; BINDING; ANTAGONISTS; RECEPTORS; HOMOLOG; PATHWAY	Wnt proteins have been implicated in regulating a variety of developmental processes in the CNS. Secreted Frizzled-related protein 3 (sFRP3) is a member of the sFRP family that can inhibit the Wnt signaling by binding directly to Wnts via their regions of homology to the Wnt-binding domain of Frizzleds. Recent studies suggested that sFRP3 plays an important role in cell proliferation and differentiation in various tissues. To understand the role of sFRP3 in neural development, we carried out detailed studies on the expression of sFRP3 in the developing nervous system. Our results revealed that sFRP3 is initially expressed in the ventricular zone of the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia (DRG), and later in the dorsal horn of spinal cord and subpopulation of DRG neurons. The spatiotemporally dynamic expression of sFRP3 strongly suggests that sFRP3 has potential functions in the sensory neuron genesis and sensory circuitry formation.

The present study shows that MC-LR can induce severe oxidative damage and apoptosis in the livers of frogs (Rana nigromaculata) exposed to 1 mu g/L MC-LR for 7 and 14d in vivo. Ultrastructural observation showed the apoptotic morphology of perinuclear chromatin margination and swollen mitochondria, indicating that MC-LR can significantly damage frog liver. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were positively correlated with exposure time. Meanwhile, reduced glutathione (GSH) content and GSH peroxidase (GPx) activity rapidly decreased after prolonged exposure to 1 mu g/L MC-LR in a time-dependent manner. These results imply that the antioxidant defense systems of the liver were damaged. Enhanced apoptosis of cells in the livers of MC-treated frogs was detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxy-UTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) associated with up-regulation of the mitochondrial system. MC-LR significantly stimulated the livers to release cytochrome c, which improved the protein expressions of Bax, caspase-3, and caspase-9 (p < 0.01) and inhibited the protein expression of Bcl-2 with prolonged exposure (p < 0.01) via the mitochondrial pathway. These results imply that the mitochondrial pathway has a key function in toxin-induced liver cell apoptosis. The expression of caspase-8 was induced significantly (p < 0.01), which illustrates the mechanism that the death receptor pathway is also involved in apoptosis. The present findings show that MC-LR can induce apoptosis in frog liver, which may be related with the decline of amphibian populations. The World Health Organization-recommended drinking water limit for MC-LR in water may be not safe for amphibians. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Although genetic mapping and subsequent functional studies indicate that GATA3 haplo-insufficiency causes human HDR syndrome, the role of Gata3 in sensorineural deafness and auditory system development is largely unknown. In this study, we show that Gata3 is continuously expressed in the developing mouse inner ear. Conditional knockout of Gata3 in the developing inner ear disrupts the morphogenesis of mouse inner ear, resulting in a disorganized and shortened cochlear duct with significant fewer hair cells and supporting cells. Loss of Gata3 function leads to the failure in the specification of prosensory domain and subsequently, to increased cell death in the cochlear duct. Moreover, though the initial generation of cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) cells is not affected in Gata3-null mice, spiral ganglion neurons (SGNs) are nearly depleted due to apoptosis. Our results demonstrate the essential role of Gata3 in specifying the prosensory domain in the cochlea and in regulating the survival of SGNs, thus identifying a molecular mechanism underlying human HDR syndrome.

Transition-metal tetrafluoroborate-containing nanogels were used as templates for fabrication in inverse systems (cyclohexane as continuous phase). Magnetic, hollow silica particles were subsequently formed by removing the polymer core and converting iron salts to iron oxides via heat treatment. We propose that the formation of the core-shell morphology is induced by the promoted precipitation of silica species at the surface of nanogels due to the interaction between silica species and transition-metal tetrafluoroborate. The influence of the synthesis parameters (type and amount of salts, pH of the nanogels, and amount of TEOS) on the particle morphology was systematically investigated. The pore properties and specific surface area of the hollow silica particles could be modified by the varying the amount of salt. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The functional connectivity from functional MRI recordings in humans is widely explored at large scale, and recently also at the voxel level. The networks of dynamical directed connections are far less investigated, in particular at the voxel level. To reconstruct full brain effective connectivity network and study its topological organization, we present a novel approach to multivariate Granger causality which integrates information theory and the architecture of the dynamical network to efficiently select a limited number of variables. The proposed method aggregates conditional information sets according to community organization, allowing to perform Granger causality analysis avoiding redundancy and overfitting even for high-dimensional and short datasets, such as time series from individual voxels in fMRI. We for the first time depicted the voxel-wise hubs of incoming and outgoing information, called Granger causality density (GCD), as a complement to previous repertoire of functional and anatomical connectomes. Analogies with these networks have been presented in most part of default mode network; while differences suggested differences in the specific measure of centrality. Our findings could open the way to a new description of global organization and information influence of brain function. With this approach is thus feasible to study the architecture of directed networks at the voxel level and individuating hubs by investigation of degree, betweenness and clustering coefficient.

J	Li, M; Liu, RR; Jia, CX; Wang, BH				Li, Ming; Liu, Run-Ran; Jia, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Bing-Hong			Critical effects of overlapping of connectivity and dependence links on percolation of networks	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							INTERDEPENDENT NETWORKS; COMPLEX NETWORKS; RANDOM GRAPHS; INTERNET; FAILURES; ATTACK	In a recent work Parshani et al (2011 Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 108 1007), dependence links have been introduced to the percolation model and used to study the robustness of the networks with such links, which shows that the networks are more vulnerable than the classical networks with only connectivity links. This model usually demonstrates a first order transition, rather than the second order transition found in classical network percolation. In this paper, considering the real situation that the interdependent nodes are usually connected, we study the cascading dynamics of networks when dependence links partially overlap with connectivity links. We find that the percolation transitions are not always sharpened by making nodes interdependent. For a high fraction of overlapping, the network is robust for random failures, and the percolation transition is second order, while for a low fraction of overlapping, the percolation process shows a first order transition. This work demonstrates that the crossover between two types of transitions does not only depend on the density of dependence links but also on the overlapping fraction of connectivity and dependence links. Using generating function techniques, we present exact solutions for the size of the giant component and the critical point, which are in good agreement with the simulations.

However, the test-retest (TRT) reliability of the application of graph metrics to these networks remains to be elucidated. Here, we used resting-state fNIRS and a graph-theoretical approach to systematically address TRT reliability as it applies to various features of human brain networks, including functional connectivity, global network metrics and regional nodal centrality metrics. Eighteen subjects participated in two resting-state fNIRS scan sessions held similar to 20 min apart. Functional brain networks were constructed for each subject by computing temporal correlations on three types of hemoglobin concentration information (HbO, HbR, and HbT). This was followed by a graph-theoretical analysis, and then an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was further applied to quantify the TRT reliability of each network metric. We observed that a large proportion of resting-state functional connections (similar to 90%) exhibited good reliability (0.6< ICC <0.74). For global and nodal measures, reliability was generally threshold-sensitive and varied among both network metrics and hemoglobin concentration signals. Specifically, the majority of global metrics exhibited fair to excellent reliability, with notably higher ICC values for the clustering coefficient (HbO: 0.76; HbR: 0.78; HbT: 0.53) and global efficiency (HbO: 0.76; HbR: 0.70; HbT: 0.78). Similarly, both nodal degree and efficiency measures also showed fair to excellent reliability across nodes (degree: 0.52 similar to 0.84; efficiency: 0.50 similar to 0.84); reliability was concordant across HbO, HbR and HbT and was significantly higher than that of nodal betweenness (0.28 similar to 0.68). Together, our results suggest that most graph-theoretical network metrics derived from fNIRS are TRT reliable and can be used effectively for brain network research. This study also provides important guidance on the choice of network metrics of interest for future applied research in developmental and clinical neuroscience.

Most of these works focus on the detection, formulation and growth of online communities. In this paper, we study users' membership in a coupled system which contains user-group and user-object bipartite networks. By linking users' membership information and their object selection, we find that the users who have collected only a few objects are more likely to be "influenced" by the membership when choosing objects. Moreover, we observe that some users may join many online communities though they collected few objects. Based on these findings, we design a social diffusion recommendation algorithm which can effectively solve the user cold-start problem. Finally, we propose a personalized combination of our method and the hybrid method in [T. Zhou, Z. Kuscsik, J.G. Liu, M. Medo, J.R. Wakeling, Y.C. Zhang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 107, 4511 (2010)], which leads to a further improvement in the overall recommendation performance.

In this Nb2Pd(S1-xSex)(5) (0 <= x <= 0.8) system, superconductivity is systematically suppressed by the Se concentration and ultimately disappears when x >= 0.5, after which a semiconductinglike ground state emerges. In spite of the considerably reduced T-c with Se doping, the ratio of the upper critical field H-c2 to T-c remains unaffected. Moreover, the size of the heat capacity jump at T-c is smaller than that expected for a BCS superconductor, implying that a strong-coupling theory cannot be the origin of this large upper critical field. In addition, the low-lying quasiparticle excitations are consistent with a nodeless gap opening over the Fermi surface. These results combined impose severe constraints on any theory of exotic superconductivity in this system.	[Niu, C. Q.; Yang, J. H.; Li, Y. K.; Chen, Bin; Zhou, N.; Chen, J.; Jiang, L.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Density Functional Theory Study of the Silicene-like SiX and XSi3 (X = B, C, N, Al, P) Honeycomb Lattices: The Various Buckled Structures and Versatile Electronic Properties	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; TRANSITION; STRAIN; BC3	Using the density functional theory calculations, we systematically investigate the structures and properties of silicene-like SiX and XSi3 (X = B, C, N, Al, P) hexagonal heterosheets. For the SIX systems, the SiP sheet favors a chairlike buckled structure akin to silicene, the SiB, SiN, and SiAl ones prefer the washboard-like buckling type, and the SiC sheet adopts the flat plane as graphene. The planarity is also favored in the XSi3 sheets with X = B, C, Al, while the rests with X = N and P prefer the chairlike buckled structures. The energetic stabilities and mechanical properties are also investigated for these SiX and XSi3 systems, and all the heterosheets are found to be stable. Unlike the semimetallic silicene, most of the SiX sheets are transformed to metals except for the SiC one with a wide band gap. For the XSi3 systems, they can be metals, semimetals, or narrow-band gap semiconductors depending on the X elements. The BSi3 and NSi3 sheets exhibit metallic behaviors, which behave like the p-type or n-type doping into silicene. On the other hand, the Al Si, and PSi3 ones turn to semiconductors with narrow indirect band gaps, which are dominated by the Si-Si and Si-X bonding/antibonding states. Of particular interests, we find the CSi3 sheet maintains the zero-band gap semimetallicity of silicene, for which the p, orbitals of Si and C atoms contribute to the linear Dirac-like bands near the Fermi level. The dynamical stabilities of the CSi3, AlSi3, and PSi3 sheets are further examined by phonon calculations and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, which confirm the robust stability of their free-standing states. Our studies demonstrate that the Si-related heterosheets have peculiar structures and properties, which have potential applications in the nanoelectronics and devices.

In this Study, a novel thermoplastic vulcanizate (TPV) based on EVM/EVA28 (VA content = 28 Wt %) blend has been Successfully fabricated by dynamic vulcanization due to the selective cross linking of EVM. The morphologies and properties of the TPVs have been investigated. It was found that the cross linked EVM phase and the thermoplastic EVA28 phase form a perfect cocontinuous structure with the rubber phase size Of about 100 nm. The fabricated TPV exhibits not only excellent stretchability (>900% elongation at break), nice elasticity (only about 19% remnant strain at 100% stretching), and good flexibility but also superior oil resistance.

The stable soliton solutions are calculated with some appropriate boundary conditions. Energy and radius of the soliton are determined in a hot medium of constituent quarks. It is found that, for T < T-c, the energy of the soliton, E*, is less than the energy of three free constituent quarks, 3M(q), but with increasing temperature the difference between E* and 3M(q) becomes smaller and smaller. Once T > T-c, there is a sharp delocalization phase transition from hadron matter to quark matter coincident with the restoration of chiral symmetry. In the transition region, the thermodynamic properties show large discontinuities which is an indication for a first-order phase transition.

Active roots that can take up nutrients more efficiently are essential for improving grain yield. In this study, we performed quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses using 215 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Xieqingzao B (CB), a maintainer line with short roots and R9308, a restorer line with long roots. Only a QTLs associated with root length were mapped on chromosomes 7. The QTL, named qRL7, was located between markers RM3859 and RM214 on chromosome 7 and explained 18.14-18.36% of the total phenotypic variance evaluated across two years. Fine mapping of qRL7 using eight BC3F3 recombinant lines mapped the QTL to between markers InDel11 and InDe117, which delimit a 657.35 kb interval in the reference cultivar Nipponbare. To determine the genotype classes for the target QTL in these BC3F3 recombinants, the root lengths of their BC3F4 progeny were investigated, and the result showed that qRL7 plays a crucial role in root length. The results of this study will increase our understanding of the genetic factors controlling root architecture, which will help rice breeders to breed varieties with deep, strong and vigorous root systems.

Our results indicate that the single phase ZrCuSiAs-type tetragonal crystal structure is preserved in (La-1-Sr-x(x))(Zn1-xTMx)AsO (TM = Mn, Fe, Co) with the doping level up to x = 0.1. While the system remains semiconducting, doping with Sr and Mn results in ferromagnetic order with T-C similar to 30 K, and doping with Sr and Fe results in a spin-glass-like state below similar to 6K with a saturation moment of similar to 0.02 mu B/Fe, an order of magnitude smaller than the similar to 0.4 mu B/ Mn of Sr-and Mn-doped samples. The same type of magnetic state is observed neither for (Zn, Fe) substitution without carrier doping, nor for Sr- and Co-doped specimens.

The controllable synthesis of a novel hexadentate and tetradentate N,O,P ligand that contains both axial and sp3-central chirality from axial BINOL and sp3-central primary amine led to the establishment of an efficient multifunctional N,O,P ligand for copper-catalyzed conjugate addition of an organozinc reagent. In the asymmetric conjugate reaction of organozinc reagents to enones, the polymer-like bimetallic multinuclear CuZn complex constructed in situ was found to be substrate-selective and a highly excellent catalyst for diethylzinc reagents in terms of enantioselectivity (up to >99%ee). More importantly, the chirality matching between different chiral sources, C2-axial binaphthol and sp3-central chiral phosphine, was crucial to the enantioselective induction in this reaction. The experimental results indicated that our chiral ligand (R,S,S)-L1- and (R,S)-L4-based bimetallic complex catalyst system exhibited the highest catalytic performance to date in terms of enantioselectivity and conversion even in the presence of 0.005mol% of catalyst (S/C=20000, turnover number (TON)=17600). We also studied the tandem silylation or acylation of enantiomerically enriched zinc enolates that formed in situ from copper-L4-complex-catalyzed conjugate addition, which resulted in the high-yield synthesis of chiral silyl enol ethers and enoacetates, respectively. Furthermore, the specialized structure of the present multifunctional N,O,P ligand L1 or L4, and the corresponding mechanistic study of the copper catalyst system were investigated by 31PNMR spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD), and UV/Vis absorption.

A plausible mechanism, which features distinctive Pd-II-mediated decarbonylative coupling and unprecedented nucleophilic attack of carboxylates to Pd-II-ligated isocyanides, was proposed to account for this reaction.

Activation of TLR4 signaling promotes gastric cancer progression by inducing mitochondrial ROS production	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						TLR4; gastric cancer; mitochondrial ROS; progression	TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; OXIDATIVE STRESS; TUMOR-GROWTH; COMPLEX-I; CELLS; INFLAMMATION; CARCINOMA; PROLIFERATION; PATHWAY	Chronic infection, such as Helicobacter pylori infection, has been associated with the development of gastric cancer (GC). Pathogen-associated molecular patterns can trigger inflammatory responses via Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in GC. Here we showed that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) was highly expressed in GC cells and was associated with the aggressiveness of GC. The binding of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to TLR4 on GC cells enhanced proliferation without affecting apoptosis. Higher level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was induced after activation of TLR4 signaling in GC. Using oxidase inhibitors and antioxidants, we found that mitochondrial ROS (mROS) was major source of TLR4-stimulated ROS generation. This elevated mROS production can be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI), and the blocking of the mROS production rather than ROS neutralization resulted in cell cycle arrest and the loss of mitochondrial potential, which were plausible reason for decreased cell viability. Furthermore, the increased mROS owing to TLR4 signaling resulted in the activation of Akt phosphorylation and NF-kappa B p65 nuclear translocation. Altogether, these results reveal a novel pathway linking innate immune signaling to GC cell proliferation, implicate mROS as an important component of cell survival signals and further establish mitochondria as hubs for GC therapies.

J	Yan, CK; Wang, RB; Pan, XC				Yan, Chuankui; Wang, Rubin; Pan, Xiaochuan			A MODEL OF HIPPOCAMPAL MEMORY BASED ON AN ADAPTIVE LEARNING RULE OF SYNAPSES	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Hippocampus; Adaptive Learning; SNR; Stochastic Resonance; Memory Pattern; Adaptive Learning	NETWORK MODEL; STOCHASTIC RESONANCE; PHASE PRECESSION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; NEURONS; DYNAMICS; CA3; OSCILLATIONS; RAT	We constructed a neural network of the hippocampus and proposed an adaptive learning rule of synapses to simulate the storing and retrieving processes of memory in the hippocampus by a mechanism of resonance. The hippocampus network consists of CA1, CA3 and DG, in particular, CA1 is a storage of memory, which receives inputs from both EC through perforant path (PP) and CA3 through Schaffer collaterals (SC). The stimulated results showed that the memory trace was unable to be encoded in CA1 when only a single subthreshold signal from EC or CA3 was inputted, of which the main reason might be lack of the resonance of the two signals. We calculated signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the network, and found it reached a peak value at appropriate SC connection strength, indicating that a typical stochastic resonance phenomenon appeared in PP signal detection. The inputs from EC and CA3 were able to enhance the memory representation in CA1, although still incomplete. We used a learning rule to modify synaptic weights by which the network could learn an external pattern. The hippocampus network tended to be stable after sufficient evolution. Some CA1 neurons show synchronized firings which are used to represent memory and are clearer than observed memory traces before learning. The model and results provide a good guidance to our understanding of the mechanism of the hippocampus memory.

Both polymers are weakly fluorescent in solutions but show greatly enhanced emission as the aggregate formation, presenting an aggregation-enhanced emission feature. Two kinds of polymer light-emitting diodes are fabricated utilizing P1 and P2 as emitters (EML) (device I: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (45 nm)/PVK:EML (1:1 wt%, 55 nm)/TPBI (38 nm)/Ca:Ag; device II: ITO/PEDOT:PSS (45 nm)/PVK:OXD-7:EML (3:1:3 wt%, 55 nm)/TPBI (38 nm)/Ca:Ag). The device II of P2 shows the best performances, affording a maximum luminance of 6500 cd/m(2) and a high peak efficiency of 2.11 cd/A.

To answer this question, in this study mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) harvested from C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were transfected with miR-126 (MSCmiR-126) using recombinant lentiviral vectors. Results showed the para-secretion and the expression levels of phosphorylated PI3K p85, Akt, p38, ERK1 protein in the MSCmiR-126 group were dramatically increased when compared with the control group. With half culture medium refreshed every 3 days, a small number of 6-day-cultured MSCmiR-126 differentiated into endothelial-like cells and most of 9-day-cultured MSCmiR-126 formed a cobblestone-like structure. These differentiated cells evidently expressed EC-specific makers and possessed mature ECs function, while inhibition of paracrine factors suppressed the MSC-EC differentiation. Strikingly, the increased secretion of MSCmiR-126 and their endothelial-differentiated potential were deprived by using a PI3K or MEK chemical inhibitor. Our results suggest that overexpression of miR-126 agumenting the endothelial differentiation of MSCs might in part be attributable to the activation of PI3K/Akt and MAPK/ERK pathways and an increased release of paracrine factors.

In this paper, we modelled a vegetation model in an arid flat environment using reaction-diffusion form and investigated the pattern formation. By using Hopf and Turing bifurcation theory, we obtain Turing region in parameters space. It is found that there are different types of stationary patterns including spotted, mixed, and stripe patterns by amplitude equation. Moreover, we discuss the changes of the wavelength with respect to biological parameters. Specifically, the wavelength becomes smaller as rainfall increases and larger as plant morality increases. The results may well explain the vegetation pattern observed in the real world and provide some new insights on preventing from desertification.

Mitigation methods are needed to reduce the environmental risk. The aims of this paper were to evaluate the feasibility and efficiency of different forms of phosphates in remediating combined contamination caused by multi-metals and arsenic near the lead/zinc mining tailings. The tested soil was taken from a clayey illitic thermic typic epiaquepts soil (depth of 0-20 cm) near a lead and zinc mine tailing, located in Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, China. Four pure chemical reagents, K2HPO4, Ca(H2PO4)(2).2H(2)O, Ca-3(PO4)(2), and Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH, were added to the soil in solution form as the trace metal stabilizing additives at a P application rate equivalent to 2,283 mg P/kg-soil and P/Pb molar ratio of 1. Shifts in trace metal speciation were determined using sequential extraction procedures and relative toxicities were evaluated using the standard EPA toxicity characteristic leaching procedure (TCLP). The addition of K2HPO4, Ca-3(PO4)(2), Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH, and Ca(H2PO4)(2).2H(2)O in the contaminated soil at the phosphorus application rate 2,283 mg P/kg-soil reduced Pb concentrations in TCLP extraction solution from 90.47 to 56.05, 83.80, 67.78, and 86.32 mg/kg (38.0, 7.36, 25.1, and 4.59% reduction), respectively. Sequential extraction analysis showed that phosphate treatments caused the transformation of easily available trace metal species to more stable forms. However, TCLP As in the soil increased from its initial value of 0.23 to 2.1, 0.70, 0.67, and 0.77 mg/kg, respectively, for the four treatments. The TCLP leachable As concentration of the K2HPO4-treated soil was about nine times of that from the untreated soil. The addition of K2HPO4, Ca-3(PO4)(2), Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH, and Ca(H2PO4)(2).2H(2)O were effective in reducing water soluble and exchangeable Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd, and minimizing TCLP-extractable Pb, Zn, and Cu. The sequential extraction test and the TCLP indicate that Ca-5(PO4)(3)OH treatment has a higher potential in immobilizing Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd, though a slight enhancement of As mobility, comparing with other phosphate treatments.

Intraspecific variation of a desert shrub species in phenotypic plasticity in response to sand burial	NEW PHYTOLOGIST			English	Article						biomass; biomechanics; functional trait coordination; half-sib family; phenotypic plasticity; sand burial; shoot elongation	SHADE-AVOIDANCE RESPONSES; MECHANICAL-PROPERTIES; IMPATIENS-CAPENSIS; SHOOT ELONGATION; TRIFOLIUM-REPENS; SOIL NUTRIENTS; GROWTH; STRESS; PLANTS; COSTS	Shoot elongation is one of the main plastic responses of plants to burial, a ubiquitous stress factor in dry ecosystems. Yet, intraspecific variation in this response to burial and the extent to which this variation is functionally coordinated with variation in other trait responses are largely unknown. We subjected seedlings of the shrub Caragana intermedia from 18 maternal parents (i.e. different half-sib families) to repeated partial burial to investigate how burial affects shoot growth, stem mechanical traits and associated plasticity. Burial increased both stem elongation and diameter growth of plants, but decreased biomass production. Half-sib families had different rates of shoot elongation, and differed in their response to burial with respect to biomechanical stem properties. Across half-sib families, the magnitude of these responses in mechanical traits was positively correlated with the magnitude of the stem elongation response. These results indicate that plasticity in different stem traits in response to sand burial and intraspecific variation therein are functionally coordinated with respect to mechanical stability. The results emphasize the importance of considering functionally coordinated traits when analyzing phenotypic plasticity in plants.

Convergent studies provide support for abnormalities in the structure and functioning of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the amygdala, the key components of the neural system that subserves emotional processing in major depressive disorder (MDD). We used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine potential amygdala-PFC functional connectivity abnormalities in treatment-naive subjects with MDD. Methods. Resting-state fMRI data were acquired from 28 individuals with MDD and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. Amygdala-PFC functional connectivity was compared between the MDD and HC groups. Results. Decreased functional connectivity to the left ventral PFC (VPFC) from the left and right amygdala was observed in the MDD group, compared with the HC group (p < 0.05, corrected). Conclusions. The treatment-naive subjects with MDD showed decreased functional connectivity from the amygdala to the VPFC, especially to the left VPFC. This suggests that these connections may play an important role in the neuropathophysiology of MDD at its onset.

We have now found that adding Co2+ at 0.1 mM to LB medium was essential for production of an active enzyme. However, a parts per thousand yen0.3 mM Co2+ inhibited the growth of host cells in LB medium and decreased the production of the recombinant NHase. Furthermore, beta-mercaptoethanol promoted regeneration of the Co2+-defective apoenzyme in vitro possibly by breaking a key disulfide bond thereby promoting the incorporation of Co2+ into the apoenzyme.

Of 220 individual spots that were excised and analyzed by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, 156 were identified and cataloged according to their functions. Twelve classes of proteins were identified. Many of these proteins were related to carbohydrate metabolism and energy production. Other notable functional classes included oxidoreductase, cell wall-related and cytoskeleton proteins. This study gives a snapshot of the proteome in 21 DPA green cotton fiber and advances our understanding of molecular mechanisms related to pigment biosynthesis in green cotton fiber.

The copolymer was characterized by FT-IR, UV-Vis, H-1 NMR, GPC, TGA, and DSC. The results reveal that the copolymer is readily soluble, and possesses excellent thermal stability, with high glass transition and decomposition temperatures of 125 and 335 degrees C, respectively. Intense red emission peaked at 612 nm, corresponding to the D-5(0) -> F-7(2) transition of Eu(III) ions is recorded under UV excitation. The luminescence lifetimes and efficiencies of some Eu-containing monomers could be greatly enhanced upon copolymerization. The special microenvironment, in which the Eu-complex units are uniformly bonded to and surrounded by the polymer chain, appears to be responsible for the improvement of the luminescence properties for the copolymer. Moreover, the applicability of the well-known Judd-Ofelt theory to the luminescence properties of Eu3+ complexes is also investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

RS1 selectively binds with Hg2+ and Cu2+ ions in CH3CN among various metal ions. RS1 shows a significant red-shift in absorption spectra from 522 nm to 581 nm for Hg2+ and 600 nm for Cu2+, which induces naked-eye color changes from pink to purple and blue. Upon excitation at 520 nm, RS1 upon interaction with Hg2+ ions shows the increase of the ratio of fluorescent intensities (I-589/I-576) from 0.84 to 1.87, while RS1 with Cu2+ exhibits a huge increase of I-610/I-576 from 0.72 to 7.87. The binding stoichiometries of RS1 with Hg2+ or Cu2+ have been determined to be 1:1 by Job's plot and ESI. The binding of RS1 with Hg2+ is chemically reversible, while the sensing processing of RS1 in response to Cu2+ ions is irreversible. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper the asymptotic distributions of the maximal arithmetic progressions and arithmetic progressions modulo n relative to an independent Bernoulli sequence with parameter p are given. The errors are estimated by using the Chen-Stein method. Then the almost sure limit behaviour of these statistics is discussed. Our work extends the results in [4] and gives an affirmative answer to the conjecture raised at the end of that paper.

The present proteomic study examined the hypothesis that certain proteins may be associated with the pathological changes in the plasma of VHD patients. Methods and Results: Differential protein analysis in the plasma identified 18 differentially expressed protein spots and 14 corresponding proteins or polypeptides by two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry in 120 subjects. Two up-regulated (complement C4A and carbonic anhydrase 1) and three down-regulated proteins (serotransferrin, alpha-1-antichymotrypsin, and vitronectin) were validated by ELISA in enlarging samples. The plasma levels (n = 40 for each) of complement C4A in RVD (715.8 +/- 35.6 vs. 594.7 +/- 28.2 ng/ml, P = 0.009) and carbonic anhydrase 1 (237.70 +/- 15.7 vs. 184.7 +/- 10.8 U/L, P = 0.007) in DVD patients were significantly higher and that of serotransferrin (2.36 +/- 0.20 vs. 2.93 +/- 0.16 mg/ml, P = 0.025) and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin (370.0 +/- 13.7 vs. 413.0 +/- 11.6 mu g/ml, P = 0.019) in RVD patients were significantly lower than those in controls. The plasma vitronectin level in both RVD (281.3 +/- 11.0 vs. 323.2 +/- 10.0 mg/ml, P = 0.006) and DVD (283.6 +/- 11.4 vs. 323.2 +/- 10.0 mu g/ml, P = 0.011) was significantly lower than those in normal controls. Conclusions: We have for the first time identified alterations of 14 differential proteins or polypeptides in the plasma of patients with various VHD. The elevation of plasma complement C4A in RVD and carbonic anhydrase 1 in DVD and the decrease of serotransferrin and alpha-1-antichymotrypsin in RVD patients may be useful biomarkers for these valvular diseases. The decreased plasma level of vitronectin - a protein related to the formation of valvular structure - in both RVD and DVD patients might indicate the possible genetic deficiency in these patients.

In this study, we aimed to elucidate the role and mechanism underlying the imbalance of Th17 and Treg cell peripheral populations in the pathogenesis of ACS. Methods and Results: Using a flow cytometric analysis, we observed a significantly increased frequency of Th17 cells and a concurrently decreased CD4(+)CD25(+)Foxp3(+) Treg cells in patients with ACS. To elucidate the mechanism of Th17/Treg imbalance in ACS, 22 inflammatory cytokines were measured using multiplexed immunobead-based assays. Of six elevated cytokines in ACS patients, only IL-6 was positively correlated with a higher Th17 cell level (r=0.39, P<0.01). Relying on IL-6 stimulating and neutralizing studies, we demonstrated a direct role for IL-6 in sera from ACS patients with an increased frequency of Th17 cells. IL-6 induces the differentiation of Th17 cells from naive CD4(+) T cells through STAT3 activation and ROR gamma t induction. However, we observed that high levels of TGF-beta 1 inhibited IL-6-dependent Th17 cell differentiation, indicating a complex interplay between the two cytokines in the control of Th17 and Treg cell populations. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the role of IL-6-STAT3 signaling in ACS through increased Th17 cell differentiation. These findings indicate that IL-6 neutralizing strategies could present novel therapeutic avenues in the treatment of ACS.

BESIII Collaboration	Partial wave analysis of psi(2S) -> p(p)over-bar eta	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							QUARK-MODEL; DECAYS; BARYONS	Using a sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi(2) events collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, the decay psi(2S) -> p (p) over bar eta is studied. A partial wave analysis determines that the intermediate state N(1535) with a mass of 1524 +/- 5(-4)(+10) MeV/c(2) and a width of 130(-24-10)(+27+57) MeV/c(2) is dominant in the decay; the product branching fraction is determined to be B(psi(2S) -> N(1535)(p) over bar x B(N(1535) -> p eta + c.c. = 5.2 +/- 0.3(-1.2)(+3.2)) x 10(-5). Furthermore, the branching fraction of psi(2S) -> p (p) over bar eta is measured to be (6.4 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.6) x 10(-5). Here, the first error is statistical and the second is systematic.

In this paper, we ask whether turtle embryos actively seek out optimal thermal environments for their development, as do post-hatching individuals. Specifically, (i) do reptile embryos move away from dangerously high temperatures as well as towards warm temperatures? and (ii) is such embryonic movement due to active thermoregulation, or (more simply) to passive embryonic repositioning caused by local heat-induced changes in viscosity of fluids within the egg? Our experiments with an emydid turtle (Chinemys reevesii) show that embryos avoid dangerously high temperatures by moving to cooler regions of the egg. The repositioning of embryos is an active rather than passive process: live embryos move towards a heat source, whereas dead ones do not. Overall, our results suggest that behavioural thermoregulation by turtle embryos is genuinely analogous to the thermoregulatory behaviour exhibited by post-hatching ectotherms.

Inflammation in the adipose tissues niches are widely believed to exert important effects on organ dysfunction. Recent data from both human and animal models suggest a role for inflammation and oxidative stress in epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) as a risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease. We hypothesized that inhalational exposure to concentrated ambient fine particulates (CAPs) and ozone (O-3) exaggerates inflammation and oxidative stress in EAT and perirenal adipose tissue (PAT). Methods: Eight-week-old Male Sprague-Dawley rats were fed a normal diet (ND) or high fructose diet (HFr) for 8 weeks, and then exposed to ambient AIR, CAPs at a mean of 356 mu g/m(3), O-3 at 0.485 ppm, or CAPs (441 mu g/m(3)) + O-3 (0.497 ppm) in Dearborn, MI, 8 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 9 days over 2 weeks. Results: EAT and PAT showed whitish color in gross, and less mitochondria, higher mRNA expression of white adipose specific and lower brown adipose specific genes than in brown adipose tissues. Exposure to CAPs and O-3 resulted in the increase of macrophage infiltration in both EAT and PAT of HFr groups. Proinflammatory genes of Tnf-alpha, Mcp-1 and leptin were significantly upregulated while IL-10 and adiponectin, known as antiinflammatory genes, were reduced after the exposures. CAPs and O-3 exposures also induced an increase in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) protein expression, and decrease in mitochondrial area in EAT and PAT. We also found significant increases in macrophages of HFr-O-3 rats. The synergetic interaction of HFr and dirty air exposure on the inflammation was found in most of the experiments. Surprisingly, exposure to CAPs or O-3 induced more significant inflammation and oxidative stress than co-exposure of CAPs and O-3 in EAT and PAT. Conclusion: EAT and PAT are both white adipose tissues. Short-term exposure to CAPs and O-3, especially with high fructose diet, induced inflammation and oxidative stress in EAT and PAT in rats. These findings may provide a link between air-pollution exposure and accelerated susceptibility to cardiovascular disease and metabolic complications.

Altered resting brain functional connectivity (FC) in ALS has been reported in several studies but with large discrepancies in terms of the alteration directions. The purpose of this study was to provide new evidence for the resting FC disruptions in ALS. We focused on FC in the motor network as motor dysfunctions are a hallmark of ALS pathology. To test the hypothesis that ALS is associated with intermotor network FC changes, we compared FC of the key nodes of motor network between 12 ALS patients and 12 matched controls, and found both decreased and increased within-motor network FC in ALS patients. Increased FC between the bilateral superior parietal lobule and the right anterior inferior cerebellum was found to be correlated with disease severity, with higher FC related to more severe disease. The decreased motor network FC may be a result of motor function degradation in ALS, whereas the increased FC and its correlation to disease severity might suggest a brain mechanism to compensate the loss of the normal motor functionality in ALS. Our results also showed that the within-motor cortex FC except the within premotor area FC did not change in these early disease stage patients.

Data sources A comprehensive search of the PubMed literature without restriction on the publication date was carried out using keywords such as UCP and NAFLD. Study selection Articles containing information related to NAFLD and UCP were selected and carefully analyzed. Results The typical concepts, up-to-date findings, and existing controversies of UCP2 in NAFLD were summarized. Besides, the effect of a novel subtype of UCP (hepatocellular down regulated mitochondrial carrier protein, HDMCP) in NAFLD was also analyzed. Finally, the concept that any mitochondrial inner membrane carrier protein may have, more or less, the uncoupling ability was reinforced. Conclusions Considering the importance of NAFLD in clinics and UCP in energy metabolism, we believe that this review may raise research enthusiasm on the effect of UCP in NAFLD and provide a novel mechanism and therapeutic target for NAFLD.

They must remain on the parent plant to enable full ripening and be picked at or near the fully ripe stage to obtain the best eating quality. However, huge losses often occur for their quick post-harvest senescence. To understanding the complex mechanism of non-climacteric fruits post-harvest senescence, we constructed two small RNA libraries and one degradome from strawberry fruit stored at 20 degrees C for 0 and 24 h. A total of 88 known and 1224 new candidatemiRNAs, and 103 targets cleaved by 19 known miRNAs families and 55 new candidatemiRNAs were obtained. These targets were associated with development, metabolism, defense response, signaling transduction and transcriptional regulation. Among them, 14 targets, including NAC transcription factor, Auxin response factors (ARF) and Myb transcription factors, cleaved by 6 known miRNA families and 6 predicted candidates, were found to be involved in regulating fruit senescence.

Two types of rubber i.e. the phase-separation-formed submicron liquid rubber (LR) and preformed nano-scale powered rubber (PR) particles were chosen as tougheners. It was found that the combination of these multi-scale rubber particles not only provides superior efficiency in enhancing the impact resistance of epoxy composites, but also results in balanced glass transition temperature. In particular, the highest gain in impact strength was obtained for the ternary composites containing 9.2 wt% submicron liquid rubber and 9.2 wt% nano-sized powered rubber which were similar to 112% higher than the maximum enhancements of similar to 49% and similar to 66% for the corresponding binary composite systems with the single-phase rubber, respectively. The damage zone observation and fracture surface analysis suggested that the combined use of multi-scale particles was effective to promote matrix plastic deformation including void growth and shear banding induced by the improved rubber cavitation/debonding, which is likely responsible for the highly improved impact resistance of the ternary composites.

An evolutionary model is proposed to investigate the dynamic behaviors of investors and investments in a market ecology. The investors are divided into two groups, active ones and passive ones, distinguished by different selection capabilities based on the partial information, while the investments are simply categorized as good ones and bad ones. Without external influence, the system consisting of both investors and investments can self-organize to a quasi-stationary state according to their own strategies associating with the gains of market information. The model suggests that the partial information asymmetry of investors and various qualities of investments commonly give rise to a diverse dynamic behavior of the system by quantifying the fraction of active investors and of good investment at the quasi-stationary state.

Zhou, Z. Kuscsik, J.-G. Liu, M. Medo, J.R. Wakeling, Y.-C. Zhang, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 107 (2010) 4511], a personalized recommendation algorithm with high performance in both accuracy and diversity is proposed. This method is based on the hybridization of two single algorithms called probability spreading and heat conduction, which respectively are inclined to recommend popular and unpopular products. With a tunable parameter, an optimal balance between these two algorithms in system level is obtained. In this paper, we apply this hybrid method in individual level, namely each user has his/her own personalized hybrid parameter to adjust. Interestingly, we find that users are quite different in personalized hybrid parameters and the recommendation performance can be significantly improved if each user is assigned with his/her optimal personalized hybrid parameter. Furthermore, we find that users' personalized parameters are negatively correlated with users' degree but positively correlated with the average degree of the items collected by each user. With these understandings, we propose a strategy to assign users with suitable personalized parameters, which leads to a further improvement of the original hybrid method. Finally, our work highlights the importance of considering the heterogeneity of users in recommendation. (c) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We demonstrate that the double dot system can stay in a dynamically decoherence free space. The coherence between two double dot charge states can be precisely manipulated through a spin-orbit coupling. The effects of the temperature, the finite bandwidth of lead, and the energy deviations during the coherence manipulation are also explored. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

The present study proposes a new framework for rice-yield prediction, which eliminates the influence of the technology development, fertilizer application, and management improvement and can be used for the development and implementation of provincial rice-yield predictions. The technique requires the collection of remotely sensed data over an adequate time frame and a corresponding record of the region's crop yields. Longer normalized-difference-vegetation-index (NDVI) time series are preferable to shorter ones for the purposes of rice-yield prediction because the well-contrasted seasons in a longer time series provide the opportunity to build regression models with a wide application range. A regression analysis of the yield versus the year indicated an annual gain in the rice yield of 50 to 128 kg ha 21. Stepwise regression models for the remotely sensed rice-yield predictions have been developed for five typical rice-growing provinces in China. The prediction models for the remotely sensed rice yield indicated that the influences of the NDVIs on the rice yield were always positive. The association between the predicted and observed rice yields was highly significant without obvious outliers from 1982 to 2004. Independent validation found that the overall relative error is approximately 5.82%, and a majority of the relative errors were less than 5% in 2005 and 2006, depending on the study area. The proposed models can be used in an operational context to predict rice yields at the provincial level in China. The methodologies described in the present paper can be applied to any crop for which a sufficient time series of NDVI data and the corresponding historical yield information are available, as long as the historical yield increases significantly.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurements of B[psi(3686) -> pi(+)pi(-)J/psi] and B[J/psi -> l(+)l(-)]	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							HADRONIC TRANSITIONS; QUARKONIUM	Based on (106.41 +/- 0.86) x 10(6) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, the branching fractions of psi(3686) -> pi(+)pi(-)J/psi, J/psi -> e(+)e(-), and J/psi -> mu(+)mu(-) are measured. We obtain B[psi(3686) -> pi(+)pi(-)J/psi] = (34.98 +/- 0.02 +/- 0.45)%, B[J/psi -> e(+)e(-)] = (5.983 +/- 0.007 +/- 0.037)%, and B[J/psi -> mu(+)mu(-)] = (5.973 +/- 0.0007 +/- 0.038)%. The measurement of B[psi(3686) -> pi(+)pi(-)J/psi] confirms the CLEO-c measurement, and is apparently larger than the others. The measured J/psi leptonic decay branching fractions agree with previous experiments within one standard deviation. These results lead to B[J/psi -> l(+)l(-)] = (5.978 +/- 0.005 +/- 0.040)% by averaging over the e(+)e(-) and mu(+)mu(-) channels and a ratio of B[J/psi -> e(+)e(-)]/B[J/psi -> mu(+)mu(-)] = 1.0017 +/- 0.0017 +/- 0.0033, which tests e- mu universality at the four tenths of a percent level. All the measurements presented in this paper are the most precise in the world to date.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H. S.; Chen, J.

The ferromagnetic phase transition temperatures are approximate to 74 and 76 K for A = K and Rb, respectively. A possible antiferromagnetic phase transition occurs around 80 K in susceptibility and a metamagnetismlike behavior is first discovered at a field of approximate to 3.5 T for H vertical bar vertical bar ab plane in CsCo2Se2 below 62 K. The susceptibilities in the paramagnetic state obey the modified Curie-Weiss law quite well in all samples. Moreover, the derived effective magnetic moments of the Co atom are about 2.21, 2.04, and 2.04 mu B/Co for A = K, Rb, and Cs, respectively. The generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio indicates an itinerant magnetism in this series. Finally, we discussed the magnetic properties in this series within the frameworks of the self-consistent renormalization and Takahashi's theory of spin fluctuations.

J	Zhou, YB; Lu, LY; Liu, WP; Zhang, JL				Zhou, Yanbo; Lu, Linyuan; Liu, Weiping; Zhang, Jianlin			The Power of Ground User in Recommender Systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Accuracy and diversity are two important aspects to evaluate the performance of recommender systems. Two diffusion-based methods were proposed respectively inspired by the mass diffusion (MD) and heat conduction (HC) processes on networks. It has been pointed out that MD has high recommendation accuracy yet low diversity, while HC succeeds in seeking out novel or niche items but with relatively low accuracy. The accuracy-diversity dilemma is a long-term challenge in recommender systems. To solve this problem, we introduced a background temperature by adding a ground user who connects to all the items in the user-item bipartite network. Performing the HC algorithm on the network with ground user (GHC), it showed that the accuracy can be largely improved while keeping the diversity. Furthermore, we proposed a weighted form of the ground user (WGHC) by assigning some weights to the newly added links between the ground user and the items. By turning the weight as a free parameter, an optimal value subject to the highest accuracy is obtained. Experimental results on three benchmark data sets showed that the WGHC outperforms the state-of-the-art method MD for both accuracy and diversity.

In this paper, we construct a local quasi-likelihood regression estimator for a left truncated model, and establish the asymptotic normality of the proposed estimator when the observations form a stationary and -mixing sequence, such that the corresponding result of Fan et al. [Local polynomial kernel regression for generalized linear models and quasilikelihood functions, J. Amer. Statist.

We find it is ascribed to the Hermite-polynomial excitation state. For the first time, we determine this state's normalization constant which turns out to be a Laguerre polynomial. This is due to the integration method within the ordered product of operators (IWOP). The normalization for the two-mode quadrature excitation state is also completed by virtue of the entangled state representation.

CeFeAsO is a parent compound of the 1111-type iron-based superconductors. It shows 3d-antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering below similar to 139 K and 4f-AFM ordering below similar to 4 K. On the other hand, the phosphide CeFePO is a ferromagnetically correlated heavy-fermion (HF) metal with Kondo scale T-K similar to 10 K. These properties set up a new platform for research of the interplay among magnetism, Kondo effect, and superconductivity (SC). In this review, we present the recent progress in the study of chemical pressure effect in CeFeAsO1-yFy (y = 0 and 0.05). This P/As-doping in CeFeAsO serves as an effective controlling parameter which leads to two magnetic critical points, x(c1) similar or equal to 0.4 and x(c2) similar or equal to 0.92, associated with suppression of 3d and 4f magnetism, respectively. We also observe a turning point of AFM-FM ordering of Ce3+ moment at x(c3) similar or equal to 0.37. The SC is absent in the phase diagram, which is attributed to the destruction to Cooper pair by Ce-FM fluctuations in the vicinity of x(c1). We continue to investigate CeFeAs1-xPxO0.95F0.05. With the separation of x(c1) and x(c3), this chemical pressure results in a broad SC region 0<x<0.53, while the original HF behavior is driven away by 5% F- doping. Different roles of P and F dopings are addressed, and the interplay between SC and Ce-4f magnetism is also discussed.

J	Dong, FQ; Lu, JB				Dong, Feiqing; Lu, Jianbo			Using solar energy to enhance biogas production from livestock residue - A case study of the Tongren biogas engineering pig farm in South China	ENERGY			English	Article						Solar energy; Biomass energy; Biogas; Pig manure; Livestock breeding pollution; Sustainable development	ANAEROBIC FERMENTATION; TEMPERATURE; DIGESTION; REACTOR; MANURE; PERFORMANCE; ELECTRICITY	Due to the rapid growth in the global energy demand and to the growing concerns regarding energy supply, more attention has been paid to the development of bioenergy, especially the one derived from anaerobic digestion. In our study we used solar energy to improve the efficiency of anaerobic fermentation at the Tongren Pig Farm in Haining city, Zhejiang province, China. Haining, located at 30 degrees 15'-30 degrees 35'N and 120 degrees 18'-120 degrees 52'E, has the average winter temperature of about 5 degrees C. At the farm, solar energy collectors, with a total area of 100.8 m(2) and a volume of 6 t water were installed to heat the water in fermentation digesters. Comparison shows that biogas production was 2540 m(3) more or 11.2% higher than that of the CK with no differences in the methane content, which can also be translated into a 14.3% increase of pig manure energy transformation efficiency.

J	Yin, QP				Yin Qiping			The Image of "Friends" and Community Building: The Cultural Implications of Our Mutual Friend	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						friend; wealth; community; Dickens; Our Mutual Friend the context of cultural criticism		Greater importance should be attached to the image of "friends", which is dense and consistent throughout Our Mutual Friend, than to the image of the mounds in the same novel. The manifold "friends" as depicted by Dickens are not meant to merely show whether friendship matters more than wealth or the other way round, but to invite the reader to participate in the discussion on the cultural proposition of wealth. To discuss wealth is to discuss culture. In the 19th century England, the ideas were already taking shape over the way in which a cultural community should be built, and Charles Dickens played an active role in this process. He has managed to get across the message, which is where his greatness lies, that no real community can be built at the expense of those living in "holes" and "corners". By fashioning the image of "mutual friends" Dickens. gets himself involved in building up a cultural context so as to critique "the cash nexus" and to pinpoint the access to a community.

Two preliminary genetic linkage maps were constructed using 90 F-1 progeny individuals derived from an interspecific cross between D. nobile and D. moniliforme (both, 2n = 38), using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and intersimple sequence repeat (ISSR). A total of 286 RAPD loci and 68 ISSR loci were identified and used for genetic linkage analysis. Maps were constructed by double pseudo-testcross mapping strategy using the software Mapmaker/EXP ver. 3.0, and Kosambi map distances were constructed using a LOD score a parts per thousand yen 4 and a recombination threshold of 0.4. The resulting frame map of D. nobile was 1474 cM in total length with 116 loci distributed in 15 linkage groups; and the D. moniliforme linkage map had 117 loci placed in 16 linkage groups spanning 1326.5 cM. Both maps showed 76.91% and 73.59% genome coverage for D. nobile and D. moniliforme, respectively. These primary maps provide an important basis for genetic studies and further medicinal and horticultural traits mapping and marker-assisted selection in Dendrobium breeding programmes.

We found that a strong surface dipole layer induced by the halogen, rather than a change in the electrochemical potential (that is, Fermi level) of the ITO, led to a dramatic increase in the work function. However, the work function for F-coated ITO was lower than that of Cl-coated ITO. This result contradicts the well-known fact that F is much more electronegative than Cl. Detailed computations reveal that both electronegativity and atomic size collectively contribute to the extraordinarily high work function of Cl-ITO. Additionally, the work function increases linearly with increasing surface halogen coverage for both systems, which was consistent with experimental data.

This study investigates the spatial distribution and pattern characteristics of land cover in the landscape using geographical information system and remote-sensing techniques. With the synthetic consideration of both physical and cultural factors, the ecological stability of the landscape was discussed. The results showed that terrace' and forest' are dominant in the landscape accounting for 43.80% and 44.90% of the total area, respectively. A clear vertical land-cover distribution of higher forest-middle village-lower terrace-lowest river' can be found on steep slopes. The local climate and its variation with elevation are essential for the stable local water cycle, and the spatial layout of the landscape elements allows for effective material and energy flow within the landscape. Moreover, the obligatory forest and water resource conservation due to the unique history and culture of Hani adds a social layer of protection. The sustainable development of the Hani landscape is expected to provide valuable insights for the present land and environmental management.

The nontarget effects of two Bt rice lines T2A-1 (Cry2A rice) and T1C-19 (Cry1C rice) on six brown planthopper populations with geographical, virulent, and resistant variations were evaluated. Populations differed significantly in relation to brown planthopper nymphal survival, nymphal duration, and female adult weight. T2A-1 and T1C-19 did not affect the ecological fitness parameters of brown planthopper compared with the parental non-Bt rice MH63. Both esterase and glutathione-S-transferase activities differed between brown planthopper populations. Esterase activity of some brown planthopper populations was significantly affected by the rice lines. It is important to take account of these findings in management of nontarget brown planthopper in Cry2A or Cry1C rice in the future.

With intermittently irradiated (ultrasound intensity of 0.7 w/cm(2), exposure time of 0.19 min), the reactor (R-U) had a nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 5.49 kg TN/m(3)/d at 14.8 degrees C, while the NRR was 1.53 kg TN/m(3)/d in the control reactor (R-C). At the end of operation, the contents of polysaccharide, protein, TTC-dehydrogenase and VSS were 6.82 mg/mgVSS, 26.79 mg/mgVSS, 0.58 mg TF/L/H and 10.11 gVSS/L in R-U, higher than the levels in the R-C. These results demonstrated that it is possible to achieve stable and highly efficient operation in an ANAMMOX reactor at low ambient temperature by implementation of ultrasonication.

However, the effects of this agent on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and its mechanisms are unknown. The present study demonstrated that CYT997 effectively inhibited the growth of AML cells in vitro. Treatment of AML cells with CYT997 resulted in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest, and induced apoptosis through the activation of extrinsic and intrinsic apoptotic pathways. Furthermore, CYT997 induced cell death in CD123(+) leukemia cells and significantly reduced leukemia colony formation. CYT997 was also demonstrated to exert dual effects on the expression of PI3K/Akt and mechanistic target of rampamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway proteins. Therefore, CTY997, used alone or in combination with chemotherapy, may represent a promising approach for the treatment of AML.

The present proposal is based on the construction of the 35 f-controlled phase gates, which uses single-qubit sigma(z) gates and two-qubit standard controlled-phase (CP) gates only. This proposal is implementable because a single-qubit sigma(z) gate can be easily realized by applying a single classical pulse and a two-qubit CP gate has been experimentally demonstrated in various physical systems. Finally, it is noted that this proposal is quite general, and can be applied to implement a three-qubit refined DJ algorithm in a cavity-based or noncavity-based physical system.

The cobalt-dependant alkaline phosphatase IV from Bacillus subtills (BSAP), which was reported to be strongly monomeric, was overexpressed in Escherichia coli using pET autoinduction system as a cytoplasmic protein without export signal sequence. After I day of growth, when the E. coli culture was near the stationary phase (standard time to harvest protein in this expression method), high amounts of BSAP were produced but the soluble fraction of BSAP was nearly inactive: the AP activity in the cell-free extract was near the background level. However, further incubation of bacterial culture lead to a tremendous increase in AP activity which was maximal at the 3rd day of incubation and was 48-100 times higher than at the 1st day of growth. The recombinant BSAP was purified by metal-chelate chromatography and characterized. Typically, 90-140 mg of active protein was produced in 1 L of culture (20 g wet cells). BSAP shows 515 U/mg activity at optimum conditions (pH 11 and 0.8-2 M NaCl). Contrary to the previous report on the native enzyme, BSAP was found to be dimeric and showed only negligible diesterase activity. The observed unusual late activation of BSAP indicates that prolonged incubation at the stationary phase may be useful for functional expression of some problematic proteins in E. coli.

The aim of this prospective nonrandomized study was to compare short-term outcomes and associated complications between LGCP and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG). From January 2011 to November 2011, a total of 39 patients were allocated to undergo either LGCP (n = 19) or LSG (n = 20). Data on the operative time, complications, hospital stay, overall cost of LSG and LGCP, body mass index loss (BMIL), percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL), loss of appetite and improvement of comorbidities were collected during the follow-up examinations. All procedures were completed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 95.0 +/- A 17.4 minutes for the LGCP group and 85.5 +/- A 18.4 minutes for the LSG group (P = 0.107). No patient required reoperation due to an early complication. One patient in the LSG group was readmitted because of gastric stenosis. The mean hospital stay was 4.2 +/- A 1.9 days in the LGCP group and 3.9 +/- A 1.7 days in the LSG group (P = 0.595). The total cost of LSG was $7,826 +/- A 537 compared to LGCP ($3,358 +/- A 264) (P < 0.001). One year after surgery, the mean %EWL was 58.8 +/- A 16.7 % (n = 11) in the LGCP group and 80.0 +/- A 26.8 % (n = 11) in the LSG group (P = 0.038). Loss of feeling of hunger was reported in 27.3 % LGCP patients and 72.7 % LSG patients (P = 0.033) at 1 year after surgery. The comorbidities, including diabetes, sleep apnea and hypertension, were markedly improved in both groups 6 months after surgery. The short-term outcomes of our study demonstrate that compared with LSG, LGCP is inferior as a restrictive procedure for weight loss, despite its significantly smaller cost. Longer follow-up and prospective comparative trials are needed to confirm the long-term outcomes of this novel procedure and make definitive conclusions.

The total binding energy, dipole moments, energy gap between the HOMO (highest-occupied molecular orbital)-LUMO (lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital) and constant volume heat capacity of these clusters are computed. Calculation results show the structures of these clusters evolve from linear to planar and three dimensions as the atom number increases. The N dimer can easily form and escape from N-rich clusters, whose physical properties are dominated by the remaining parts.

A set of water samples collected bimonthly at 12 monitoring sites in 2009 and 2010 were analyzed to determine the spatial distribution of critical parameters and to apportion the sources of pollutants in Wen-Rui-Tang (WRT) river watershed, near the East China Sea. The 12 monitoring sites were divided into three administrative zones of urban, suburban, and rural zones considering differences in land use and population density. Multivariate statistical methods [one-way analysis of variance, principal component analysis (PCA), and absolute principal component score-multiple linear regression (APCS-MLR) methods] were used to investigate the spatial distribution of water quality and to apportion the pollution sources. Results showed that most water quality parameters had no significant difference between the urban and suburban zones, whereas these two zones showed worse water quality than the rural zone. Based on PCA and APCS-MLR analysis, urban domestic sewage and commercial/service pollution, suburban domestic sewage along with fluorine point source pollution, and agricultural nonpoint source pollution with rural domestic sewage pollution were identified to the main pollution sources in urban, suburban, and rural zones, respectively. Understanding the water pollution characteristics of different administrative zones could put insights into effective water management policy-making especially in the area across various administrative zones.

All the Stabilizer Codes of Distance 3	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION THEORY			English	Article						1-error correcting stabilizer codes; optimal codes; quantum error correction; quantum Hamming bound	QUANTUM-ERROR-CORRECTION; CORRECTING CODES	We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of stabilizer codes [[n, k, 3]] of distance 3 for qubits: n - k >= [log(2)(3n + 1)] +epsilon n, where epsilon(n) = 1 if n = 8 4(m)-1/3 + {+/- 1, 2} or n = 4(m+2)-1/3 - {1, 2, 3} for some integer m >= 1 and epsilon(n) = 0 otherwise.

The co-expression system was then used as a whole-cell biocatalyst to synthesize chiral phenyl methyl sulfoxide (PMSO) from thioanisole (PMS) and the reaction conditions were investigated. When the initial concentration of PMS was 20 mM, the specific productivity of PMSO in this system was 2.07 mu mol g(-1) cw min(-1) (cw: wet cell weight) and the ee value for the R-sulfoxide was 99 %. In contrast, when chmo was the only gene expressed in E. coli, the specific productivity of PMSO was 0.053 mu mol g(-1) cw min(-1) with no exact enantioselectivity. Further determination of NADPH concentration in the whole-cell catalysts suggested that co-expression of fdh with chmo significantly improved NADPH supply. Thus, this whole-cell biocatalyst system is highly advantageous for the synthesis of optically pure R-sulfoxide.

Here we investigated the involvement of both receptors in oxygen-glucose deprivation/recovery (OGD/R)-induced ischemic neuronal injury and the effect of the novel CysLT2R antagonist HAMI 3379 [3-({[(1S,3S)-3- carboxycyclohexyl]amino} carbonyl)4-( 3-{4-[4-(cyclo-hexyloxy) butoxy] phenyl} propoxy) benzoic acid] in comparison with the CysLT1R antagonist montelukast. In primary neurons, neither the nonselective agonist leukotriene D4 (LTD4) nor the CysLT2R agonist N-methyl-leukotriene C4 (NMLTC4) induced neuronal injury, and HAMI 3379 did not affect OGD/R-induced neuronal injury. However, in addition to OGD/R, LTD4 and NMLTC4 induced cell injury and neuronal loss in mixed cultures of cortical cells, and neuronal loss and necrosis in neuron-microglial cocultures. Moreover, they induced phagocytosis and cytokine release (interleukin-1b and tumor necrosis factor-a) from primary microglia, and conditioned medium from the treated microglia induced neuronal necrosis. HAMI 3379 inhibited all of these responses, and its effects were the same as those of CysLT2R interference by CysLT2R short hairpin RNA, indicating CysLT2R dependence. In comparison, montelukast moderately inhibited OGD/R-induced primary neuronal injury and most OGD/R-and LTD4-induced (but not NMLTC4-induced) responses in mixed cultures, cocultures, and microglia. The effects of montelukast were both dependent and independent of CysLT1Rs because interference by CysLT1R small interfering RNA had limited effects on neuronal injury in neuron-microglial cocultures and on cytokine release from microglia. Our findings indicated that HAMI 3379 effectively blocked CysLT2R-mediated microglial activation, thereby indirectly attenuating ischemic neuronal injury. Therefore, CysLT2R antagonists may represent a new type of therapeutic agent in the treatment of ischemic stroke.

Dysregulation of macrophage differentiation has been implicated in infectious and inflammatory diseases. Here, we show that protein kinase B/Akt1 signaling induced by Staphylococcus aureus is essential in shifting macrophages from an antimicrobial phenotype (M1) to a functionally inert signature. Akt1(-/-)mice consistently had enhanced bacterial clearance and greater survival, compared with their wild-type littermates. The blunted M1 macrophage reaction driven by Akt1 was associated with decreased RelA/nuclear factor kappa B activity. Furthermore, by repression of the expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1), microRNA 155 revealed to promote the transcription of M1 signature genes in macrophages from Akt1(-/-) mice. Accordingly, blocking of microRNA 155 in macrophages from Akt1(-/-)mice or knockdown of SOCS1 in cells from wild-type mice disabled or enabled, respectively, an M1 macrophage shift and antibacterial response. These results thus establish an Akt1-mediated, microRNA-involved circuit that regulates pathogen-driven macrophage polarization and, subsequently, the host response to infection.

High nitrogen removal rates of greater than 36 kg-N m(-3) d(-1) were achieved through the 81 and 75 days restoration of R-1 and R-2, respectively. The recovery performance was determined by specific sludge removal rate, heme c contents, specific ANAMMOX activity, settling properties and morphology of ANAMMOX granules. In addition, the modified Boltzmann model, the modified Gompertz model and the modified Logistic model were applied to simulate recovery performance. The modified Boltzmann model was found to be appropriate for predicting recovery performance of the phenol-inhibited reactor, while the modified Logistic model effectively simulated the recovery performance of the sulfide suppressed reactor.

The graphene sheets were exfoliated from graphite oxide (GO) via thermal reduction (thermally reduced GO, RGO). Different dispersions of RGO sheets were prepared with and without ball mill mixing. It was found that the composites with highly dispersed RGO showed higher glass transition temperature (T-g) and strength than those with poorly dispersed RGO, although no significant differences in both the tensile and flexural moduli are caused by the different dispersion levels. In particular, the T-g was increased by nearly 11 degrees C with the addition of 0.2 wt.% well dispersed RGO to epoxy. As expected, the highly dispersed RGO also produced one or two orders of magnitude higher electrical conductivity than the corresponding poorly dispersed RGO. Furthermore, an improved quasi-static fracture toughness (K-IC) was measured in the case of good dispersion. The poorly and highly dispersed RGO at 0.2 wt.% loading resulted in about 24% and 52% improvement in K-IC of cured epoxy thermosets, respectively. RGO sheets were observed to bridge the micro-crack and debond/delaminate during fracture process due to the poor filler/matrix and filler/filler interface, which should be the key elements of the toughening effect.

Compared with FeAs-based superconductors, iron-chalcogenide superconductors have aroused enormous enthusiasm to study the relationship between SC and magnetisms with several distinct features, such as different antiferromagnetic ground states with relatively large moments in the parents, indicating possibly different superconducting mechanisms, the existence of the excess Fe atoms or Fe vacancies in the crystal lattice. Another reason is that the large single crystals are easily grown for the iron-chalcogenide compounds. This review will focus on our exploration for the iron-chalcogenide superconductors and discussion on several issues, including the crystal structure, magnetic properties, superconductivity, and phase separation. Some of them reach a consensus but some important questions still remain to be answered.

Several lysozyme-loaded chitosan/poly-gamma-glutamic acid composite nanosystems for loading and controlling the release of lysozymes were established. The lysozyme loading content and efficiency of the different systems were examined. The antibacterial activity of the composite nanoparticles was also investigated. Results showed that when the lysozymes were coated with poly-gamma-glutamic acid and further rewrapped with chitosan, smooth spherical composite nanoparticles were obtained; the loading efficiency and loading content reached 76% and 40%, respectively. The lysozyme release in vitro was slow and presented a two-stage programmed release. Antibacterial testing in vitro indicated that lysozyme-loaded nanoparticles coated with poly-gamma-glutamic acid/chitosan had outstanding antibacterial activity. An obvious assembly of bacterial cells and composite nanoparticles was observed during co-incubation. Therefore, the poly-gamma-glutamic acid/chitosan composite coating broadened the antibacterial spectrum of the composite lysozyme nanoreagent, and presented satisfactory antibacterial effect. The lysozyme-loaded chitosan/poly-gamma-glutamic acid nanocoating system established in this research could provide reference for coating and controlled releasing of alkaline proteins.

Worldwide production of date fruit has increased almost threefold over the last 40 years, reaching 7.68 million tons in 2010. Date fruit can provide many essential nutrients and potential health benefits to the consumer. Date fruit goes through four ripening stages named kimri, khalal, rutab and tamer. The main chemical components of date fruit include carbohydrates, dietary fibre, enzymes, protein, fat, minerals, vitamins, phenolic acids and carotenoids. The chemical composition of date fruit varies according to ripening stage, cultivar, growing environment, postharvest conditions, etc. The nutritional and medicinal activities of date fruit are related to its chemical composition. Many studies have shown that date fruit has antioxidant, antimutagenic, anti-inflammatory, gastroprotective, hepatoprotective, nephroprotective, anticancer and immunostimulant activities. Various date fruit-based products such as date syrup, date paste, date juice and their derived products are available. Date by-products can be used as raw materials for the production of value-added products such as organic acids, exopolysaccharides, antibiotics, date-flavoured probiotic-fermented dairy produce, bakery yeasts, etc. In this paper the chemical composition and nutritional and medicinal values of date fruit as well as date fruit-based products are reviewed.

Here, we reported the identification of Par-1 as a regulator of the Hpo signaling pathway using a gain-of-function EP screen in Drosophila melanogaster. Overexpression of Par-1 elevated Yorkie activity, resulting in increased Hpo target gene expression and tissue overgrowth, while loss of Par-1 diminished Hpo target gene expression and reduced organ size. We demonstrated that par-1 functioned downstream of fat and expanded and upstream of hpo and salvador (sav). In addition, we also found that Par-1 physically interacted with Hpo and Sav and regulated the phosphorylation of Hpo at Ser30 to restrict its activity. Par-1 also inhibited the association of Hpo and Sav, resulting in Sav dephosphorylation and destabilization. Furthermore, we provided evidence that Par-1-induced Hpo regulation is conserved in mammalian cells. Taken together, our findings identified Par-1 as a novel component of the Hpo signaling network.

Phenoloxidase (PO) is an important component in insect innate immunity and is necessary for acclimatization. In our study, two prophenoloxidase (PPO) subunits were obtained from fat body of Catantops pinguis (Stal). The full-length cDNA sequence of one PPO (CpPPO1) consisted of 2347bp with an open reading frame (ORF) of 2187bp encoding 728 amino acids, while the other subunit (CpPPO2) had a full length of 2445bp, encoding 691 amino acids. Both the PPO gene products are predicted to possess all the structural features of other PPO members, including two putative tyrosinase copper-binding motifs with six highly conserved histidine residues and a thiolester-like motif. Tissue distribution analysis showed that both PPO mRNAs were abundantly expressed in the fat body among 11 tissues examined, and they were transiently up-regulated after Escherichia coli infection, consistent with them being immune-responsive genes. Total levels of CpPPO1 and CpPPO2 mRNA transcripts were much higher in first instar larvae and adults. A much higher transcript level of CpPPO1 was detected in several months, while there were extremely high mRNA expression levels of CpPPO2 in January, July, October, and December. The above results suggested that PPO from fat body might also bring significant function during the processes of development and acclimatization for C. pinguis.

In this study, we have evaluated the biological effects of multiwall carbon nano-onions (MWCNOs) (average size of 31.2 nm, potential of 1.6 mV) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). It was found that MWCNOs exhibited a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on cell growth; EC50 was 44.12 g/mL. Thus, three concentrations were chosen (0.2, 1, and 5 g/mL) for further experiments. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that 1 and 5 g/mL MWCNOs could induce apoptosis in HUVECs, the apoptotic rates were 12% and 24% at 24 h after exposure. On the other hand, MWCNOs did not affect the cell cycle distribution during 24 h period. Using H2AX foci formation as an indicator for DNA damage, it was shown that 5 g/mL MWCNOs can induce H2AX foci formation in HUVECs at 6, 12, and 24 h after treatment, whereas 0.2 g/mL MWCNOs induced H2AX foci formation only at 6 h after treatment. In addition, all three concentrations of MWCNOs induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and inhibition of ROS generation can partially decrease the H2AX foci formation induced by MWCNOs. Taken together, these data first suggested that MWCNOs can induce DNA damage and apoptosis in HUVECs, and that ROS might be involved in this process. (c) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

This study evaluated H.pylori resistance to antibiotics in the southeast coastal region of China and suggests appropriate alternatives. Materials and Methods Seventeen thousand seven hundred and thirty one H.pylori strains were collected from eight areas of two provinces in coastal southeast China from 2010 to 2012. The resistance of these strains to six antibiotics was tested using the agar dilution method. Results The resistance rates to clarithromycin, metronidazole, levofloxacin, amoxicillin, gentamicin and furazolidone were 21.5, 95.4, 20.6, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.1%, respectively. Double, triple and quadruple antibacterial resistant percentages were 25.5, 7.5 and 0.1%, respectively. A positive association between the resistance to levofloxacin and to clarithromycin was found, but there was a negative correlation in the resistances to levofloxacin and to metronidazole.

Participants were asked to read an "adjective + noun" phrase, where the adjective could be a positive or negative word, and the noun could be a positive, neutral or negative word, and then to make an emotional evaluation on the emotional tone of the target noun based on a 9-point Likert scale. In a control condition, an isolated noun was presented with no context. Results showed that positive context made the evaluation of target words bias toward positive tone, while negative context shaped the evaluation of target words toward negative tone. The modulatory effect of negative context was greater than that of positive context in shaping evaluation of emotional words with opposite valence. Moreover, the modulatory effect of emotional context was constrained by the inherent meaning of target word. The present study demonstrated the flexibility as well as the relative stability of emotional meaning of word.

J	Zheng, MH; Lu, LY; Zhao, M				Zheng, Muhua; Lu, Linyuan; Zhao, Ming			Spreading in online social networks: The role of social reinforcement	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							COMPLEX; EMERGENCE	Some epidemic spreading models are usually applied to analyze the propagation of opinions or news. However, the dynamics of epidemic spreading and information or behavior spreading are essentially different in many aspects. Centola's experiments [Science 329, 1194 (2010)] on behavior spreading in online social networks showed that the spreading is faster and broader in regular networks than in random networks. This result contradicts with the former understanding that random networks are preferable for spreading than regular networks. To describe the spreading in online social networks, a unknown-known-approved-exhausted four-status model was proposed, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement and assumes that the redundant signals can improve the probability of approval (i.e., the spreading rate). Performing the model on regular and random networks, it is found that our model can well explain the results of Centola's experiments on behavior spreading and some former studies on information spreading in different parameter space. The effects of average degree and network size on behavior spreading process are further analyzed. The results again show the importance of social reinforcement and are accordant with Centola's anticipation that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree will enlarge the difference of the density of final approved nodes between regular and random networks. Our work complements the former studies on spreading dynamics, especially the spreading in online social networks where the information usually requires individuals' confirmations before being transmitted to others.

The interaction is expressed by E = E-0 + kx, where E-0 is the initial potential energy at the entrance, x is the position of the monomer inside the channel, and k is the energy gradient. The mean first passage time tau is calculated by using Fokker-Planck equation for two cases (1) N > L and (2) N < L under the assumption that the diffusion rate D is a constant, here N is the polymer length and L is the length of channel. Results show that there is a minimum of t at k = k(c) for both cases, and the value kc is dependent on E-0 and driving force f. At large f, the scaling relation tau similar to N is observed for long polymer chains. But the scaling relation is dependent on the energy gradient k for an unforced driving translocation.

METHODS: Subjects were selected from patients admitted the gastrointestinal (GI) department at The First Affiliated Hospital School of Medicine (Zhejiang University) for abdominal pain, hematochezia, diarrhea and other GI symptoms between January 2008 and September 2012. CD was diagnosed by endoscopy and biopsy. H. pylori infection was detected by a C-14-urea breath test and culturing of the biopsy sample. Demographic, anthropometric and serologic data were collected for each patient. H. pylori infection rate was compared between CD and control groups, followed by a subgroup analysis based on extent and severity of CD. Student's t, Mann-Whiney U, and chi(2) tests were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: A total of 447 patients were analyzed, including 229 in the CD group and 248 in the control group. There were no significant differences in age, sex, and rates of hypertension or diabetes. However, the CD group showed significantly higher rates of smoking history (34.9% vs 18.1%), alcohol intake (17.4% vs 8.1%), white blood cell count (9.7 +/- 2.9 x 10(9)/L vs 4.3 +/- 0.9 x 10(9)/L), and C-reactive protein (36.3 +/- 20.8 mg/L vs 5.5 +/- 2.3 mg/L) but lower body mass index (24.5 +/- 2.0 kg/m(2) vs 26.0 +/- 2.2 kg/m(2)) than the control group. The H. pylori infection rate in the CD group was 27.1%, significantly lower than that of 47.9% in the control group. Furthermore, the H. pylori infection rates in patients with colonic, small intestine, ileocolonic and extensive CD were 31.1%, 28.9%, 26.8% and 25.9% respectively, all of which were significantly lower than in the control group. Finally, the H. pylori infection rates in patients with remission, moderate and severe CD were 34.3%, 30.7% and 22.0% respectively, which were also significantly lower than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Lower H. pylori infection in CD patients suggests a correlation between bacterial infection and CD, suggesting caution when considering H. pylori eradication in CD patients.

In the mean-field approximation, we give the phase diagram in which the phase boundary only depends on the atomic transition strength and the atom-molecule energy detuning, but not on the atomic interactions. Such a phase boundary is further confirmed by calculating the fidelity of the ground state and the energy gap between the first excited state and the ground state. As a comparison to the mean-field results, we also study the quantum phase transition with the full quantum method where the phase boundary depends on the particle number. Analysing the finite-size scaling behaviours of the energy gap, the fidelity susceptibility and the first-order derivative of entanglement entropy with respect to the atomic transition strength, we obtain their critical exponents by numerical calculation and show that in the thermodynamic limit, one can obtain the same phase boundary as in the mean-field approximation. Our results show a new way to manipulate the quantum phase transition by regulating the atomic transition strength with the intensity of the laser.

The molecular mechanisms underlying root development have been extensively studied to improve root system architecture, especially for the crops. Several microRNA (miRNA) families have been demonstrated to be involved in plant root development. However, whether the other small RNA (sRNA) species, which occupy a dominant portion of the plant endogenous sRNA population, possess potential roles in root development remains unclear. Results: In this study, by using sRNA high-throughput sequencing data, we made a comparison of the sRNA accumulation levels between the rice root tips and the whole roots. The sRNAs highly accumulated in the root tips and in the whole roots were extracted respectively. After Argonaute 1 (AGO1) enrichment analysis, the sRNAs with great potential of performing target cleavages were included for target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation. As a result, lists of the targets regulated by the AGO1-enriched sRNAs were obtained for both the root tips and the whole roots. Further evidences were identified from microarray data of the target genes to support some of the sRNA-target interactions. Specifically, the expression patterns of certain target genes in the root tips and the whole roots were contrary to those of the regulating sRNAs. Besides, several targets were indicated to play important roles in root development based on literature mining. Conclusions: Taken together, the regulatory networks mediated by the sRNAs highly accumulated in the root tips or in the whole roots could advance our current understanding of the sRNA-involved molecular mechanisms underlying rice root development. And, the sRNA-target lists could serve as the basis for further functional investigations.

High nitrogen removal rates of 30.1 and 30.9 kg m(-3) d(-1), were accomplished respectively for R-1 and R-2 after reactivation. The performance recovery was well indicated by change in pH, stoichiometric ratio, specific ANAMMOX activity, and morphological and physical properties of ANAMMOX granules. The modified Stover-Kincannon model properly simulated the regain performance, and theoretical removal rates of 151.5 and 212.8 kg-N m(-3) d(-1) were predicted for R-1 and R-2, respectively. The ANAMMOX activity and performance initially stressed by copper (II) and OTC for a long time (nearly 200 days) were restorable and the recovery process lasted for a relatively short time (56 and 51 days for R-1 and R-2, respectively).

The phase diagram, miscibility, glass transition temperatures, and physical properties have been investigated systematically. The PLLA/POM blends exhibit typical lower critical solution temperature (LCST) behaviors. PLLA and POM are miscible in the melt state at low temperature and become phase-separated at elevated temperatures. It was found that the weak interactions between the carboxyl groups of PLLA and methylene groups of POM (weak C-(HO)-O-... hydrogen bonding) account for the miscibility of the two components. Although the PLLA/POM blends are homogeneous at the melt state in the miscible temperature region, two distinct glass transition temperatures are observed for the all blends when quenched from the homogeneous state. More surprisingly, both POM and PLLA exhibit the apparent glass transition temperature (T-g depression in the blends, compared with T(g)s of the neat polymers. The behaviors are totally different from other reported miscible or partially miscible polymer blends, in which T(g)s shift to each other or merge into one glass transition temperature. The investigation indicates that the crystallization of POM in the blend induces the phase separation of PLLA/POM blends and forms novel morphologies with the interpenetrated (cocontinuous) PLLA and POM phases. The double glass transition temperature depression of both PLLA and POM in the blends originates from the mismatch thermal shrinkage during cooling down from the high temperature. Moreover, we observed the improved ductility of the PLLA/POM blends as compared with the neat PLLA and POM, which has been attributed to higher molecular mobility due to the glass transition temperature depression for both PLLA and POM in the blends.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Electronic structures of silicene/GaS heterosheets	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							BAND-GAP; GRAPHENE	Although Dirac-like electronic properties are predicted for silicene, recent experiments find substrate-induced complex bucklings would destruct such feature [C.-L. Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 076801 (2013)]. Here, using first-principles calculations, we propose that the recently synthesized gallium sulfide (GaS) nanosheet could be an appropriate substrate for silicene, which can form commensurate Si/GaS heterosheets akin to graphene/BN systems. More importantly, in these heterosheets, the characteristic Dirac-like band feature of linear dispersions is retained, and due to the intrinsic electric field, a sizable band gap is opened at the Dirac point, which could be further tuned by bias voltage or strains.

J	Wang, SK; Zheng, X; Jin, JS; Yan, YJ				Wang, Shikuan; Zheng, Xiao; Jin, Jinshuang; Yan, YiJing			Hierarchical Liouville-space approach to nonequilibrium dynamical properties of quantum impurity systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							NUMERICAL RENORMALIZATION-GROUP; TIME-DEPENDENT TRANSPORT; MESOSCOPIC CONDUCTORS; INFINITE DIMENSIONS; MAXIMUM-ENTROPY; MOTT TRANSITION; HUBBARD-MODEL; ELECTRON-SPIN; DOT; MATRIX	We propose a hierarchical dynamics approach for evaluation of nonequilibrium dynamic response properties of quantum impurity systems. It is based on a hierarchical equations of motion formalism, in conjunction with a linear response theory established in the hierarchical Liouville space. This provides an accurate and universal tool for characterization of a variety of response and correlation functions of local impurities, as well as transport related response properties. The practicality of our proposed approach is demonstrated via the evaluation of various dynamical properties of a single-impurity Anderson model. These include the impurity spectral density, local charge fluctuation, local magnetic susceptibility, and current-voltage admittance, in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium situations. The numerical results are considered to be quantitatively accurate, as long as they converge quantitatively with respect to the truncation of the hierarchy.

The simultaneous phase separation and dewetting in PMMA/SAN [poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile)] blend ultrathin films upon solvent annealing have been observed in our previous work. The composition dependence of phase behaviors in the same system has been investigated using atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering. Both phase separation and dewetting were observed across the entire composition range investigated. The evolution of film structures during solvent annealing was dependent on the blend composition. Solvent annealing led to complex structures, in which the upper (small spots, bicontinuous structures or large continuous droplet) and lower (mimic-film) parts were composed of phase-separated SAN- and PMMA-rich phases, respectively. With increasing blend SAN weight fraction, the diameter of the lower PMMA-rich mimic-film decreased. The upper SAN-rich phase structure transformed depending on the SAN content; to small spots (<50% SAN content), a bicontinuous structure (50% SAN content), or a large continuous droplet (>50% SAN content), on top of the PMMA mimic-film.

It can be characterized as a progressive neurological disorder of which the most recognizable feature is a tremor of the arms or hands that is apparent during voluntary movements such as eating and writing. The pathology of ET remains unclear. Resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, was employed to investigate abnormalities of functional connectivity in ET in the brain. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was used as a metric of RS-fMRI to assess the local functional connectivity abnormality in ET with 20 ET patients and 20 age-and gender-matched healthy controls (HC). The ET group showed decreased ReHo in the anterior and posterior bilateral cerebellar lobes, the bilateral thalamus and the insular lobe, and increased ReHo in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, the left primary motor cortex and left supplementary motor area. The abnormal ReHo value of ET patients in the bilateral anterior cerebellar lobes and the right posterior cerebellar lobe were negatively correlated with the tremor severity score, while positively correlated with that in the left primary motor cortex. These findings suggest that the abnormality in cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor pathway is involved in tremor generation and propagation, which may be related to motor-related symptoms in ET patients. Meanwhile, the abnormality in the prefrontal and parietal regions may be associated with non-motor symptoms in ET. These findings suggest that the ReHo could be utilized for investigations of functional-pathological mechanism of ET.

As a wide band gap p-type oxide semiconductor, LaCuSO satisfies all the conditions forecasted theoretically to be a room temperature DMS. The Curie temperature (T-C) is around 200 K as x >= 0.05, which is among the highest T-C record of known bulk DMS materials up to now. The system provides a rare example of oxide DMS system with p-type conduction, which is important for formation of high temperature spintronic devices. (C) 2013 Author(s).

Effective process to achieve enhanced electrochromic performances based on poly(4,4 ',4 ''-tris[4-(2-bithienyl)pheny]amine)/ZnO nanorod composites	NANOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							MULTICHROMIC COPOLYMER; POLYMER; FABRICATION	Poly(4,4',4 ''-tris[4-(2-bithienyl)pheny]amine) (PTBTPA) was electrochemically synthesized on a ZnO-coated ITO electrode to form a PTBTPA/ZnO nanocomposite electrode. The composite film exhibited a noticeable electrochromism, with reversible color changes from orange in the reduced state (0 V), olive green in the middle state (0.9 V) to dark gray in the oxidized state (1.2 V). Furthermore, the composite film showed a fast switching time of 0.92 s and a high optical contrast of 65% at 1100 nm, and retained 97% of its original electroactivity after 500 cycles, while PTBTPA film had switching time of 1.63 s and an optical contrast of 52% at 1100 nm, and retained 75% of its original electroactivity. The results demonstrated that the electrochromic performances were significantly enhanced through incorporating PTBTPA with ZnO nanorods. ZnO nanorods were introduced to modify the structure of the electrode: on one hand, to offer a directional attraction for the counterions, and on the other hand, to enhance the adhesion between the polymer and the ITO electrode. Accordingly, a conducting polymer/inorganic nanocomposite system could improve the polymer's electrochromic performance, especially in terms of the switching speed and long-term stability of the electrochromic materials.

As compared to other methods, bioinformatics mining of microsatellite markers from EST datasets is one of the most efficient and economical way. Our study is aimed to generate new EST-SSR markers and to evaluate their potential for cross-species utilization in phylogeny study of genus Dendrobium. A total of 1835 unigene ESTs were assembled by sequencing a normalized cDNA library, in which 500 SSR loci were identified. Of these SSRs, 38.0% (190) were the di-nucleotide repeats, followed by trimer (189, 37.8%), hexamer (81, 16.2%), pentamer (19, 3.8%), and tetramer (21, 4.2%). (AG)(n) and (AAG)(n) predominated in dimers and trimers, respectively. One hundred seventy novel D. nobile EST-SSR markers were developed, and 142 of them were successfully transferred to at least one of the other 31 Dendrobium species, with an average transferability of 42% in the genus. SSR markers with high cross-species transferability and high genetic diversity were selected for phylogeny analysis, where the results showed a complex genetic architecture among different sections as well as wide genetic differentiation within section Dendrobium. These microsatellite markers enrich the current resource of molecular markers, which would facilitate further evolution and genetic diversity studies, germplasm appraisal, genetic mapping, and molecular breeding of D. nobile and other congeneric species.

We find that the model at half-filling displays a quantum phase transition between topological and Kondo insulators at a nonzero Kondo coupling. In the Kondo-screened case, tuning the electron concentration can lead to a new topological insulator phase. The results suggest that the heavy-fermion phase diagram contains a new regime with a competition among topological, Kondo-coherent and magnetic states, and that the regime may be especially relevant to Kondo lattice systems with 5d-conduction electrons. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results in the context of the recent experiments on SmB6 implicating the surface states of a topological insulator, as well as the existing experiments on the phase transitions in SmB6 under pressure and in CeNiSn under chemical pressure.

(La1-xBax)(Zn1-xMnx)AsO: A two-dimensional 1111-type diluted magnetic semiconductor in bulk form	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							CUMN; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; FERROMAGNETISM; HYSTERESIS; PN	We report the synthesis and characterization of a bulk diluted magnetic semiconductor (La1-xBax)(Zn1-xMnx)AsO (0 <= x <= 0.2) with a layered crystal structure identical to that of the 1111-type FeAs superconductors. No ferromagnetic order occurs with (Zn,Mn) substitution in the parent compound LaZnAsO without charge doping. Together with carrier doping via (La,Ba) substitution, a small amount of Mn substituting for Zn results in ferromagnetic order with T-C up to similar to 40 K, although the system remains semiconducting. Muon spin relaxation measurements confirm the development of ferromagnetic order in the entire volume, with the relationship between the internal field and TC consistent with the trend found in (Ga,Mn) As and the 111-type Li(Zn,Mn) As and the 122-type (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)(2)As-2 systems.

However, the molecular details and in vivo biological significance of REG gamma-p53 interplay remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that REG gamma-deficient mice develop premature aging phenotypes that are associated with abnormal accumulation of casein kinase (CK) 1 delta and p53. Antibody array analysis led us to identify CK1 delta as a direct target of REG gamma. Silencing CK1 delta or inhibition of CK1 delta activity prevented decay of murine double minute (Mdm)2. Interestingly, a massive increase of p53 in REG gamma(-/-) tissues is associated with reduced Mdm2 protein levels despite that Mdm2 transcription is enhanced. Allelic p53 haplodeficiency in REG gamma-deficient mice attenuated premature aging features. Furthermore, introducing exogenous Mdm2 to REG gamma(-/-) MEFs significantly rescues the phenotype of cellular senescence, thereby establishing a REG gamma-CK1-Mdm2-p53 regulatory pathway. Given the conflicting evidence regarding the "antiaging" and "proaging" effects of p53, our results indicate a key role for CK1 delta-Mdm2-p53 regulation in the cellular aging process. These findings reveal a unique model that mimics acquired aging in mammals and indicates that modulating the activity of the REG gamma-proteasome may be an approach for intervention in aging-associated disorders.

Experimental data from genetically modified mice and human premature aging diseases clearly indicate that intact telomere function is crucial for cell proliferation and survival, whereas dysfunctional telomeres can lead to either cancer or aging pathologies, depending on the integrity of the cellular stress response pathways. The canonical function of telomerase reverse transcriptase is the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats and the maintenance of telomere length. However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase may also exert some fundamental biological functions independently of its enzymatic activity in telomere maintenance. More recent studies have demonstrated that telomerase reverse transcriptase can act as a transcriptional modulator in the nucleus and exhibits RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity in the mitochondria. Telomerase activation may have both telomere-dependent and telomere-independent implications for tumor progression. Many excellent reviews have described critical roles of telomere and telomerase in human cancer; this minireview will focus on the role of telomerase in cancer progression, with a special emphasis on the nontelomeric function of telomerase.

The study of the interaction of GAF domain with isoleucine gains much attention in recent years, but the mechanism of isoleucine release still remains unclear. In this paper, a conventional molecular dynamics (MD) and force probe molecular dynamics (FPMD) simulations have been performed with the aim to understand how the isoleucine ligand escapes from the GAF domain of N-CodY from Bacillus subtilis. The MD results reveal that the ligand release is a gradual process, which is accompanied by the movement of the loop between beta 3 and beta 4. During the periods of ligand escaping from the bottom to the top of binding pocket, isoleucine forms hydrogen bonds one after another with series of residues, such as ARG61, THR96, PHE98, VAL100, GLU101 and ASN102, under the mediation of hydrophobic contacts. The FPMD results show that the easiest way to pull ligand out of the cavity is along x direction (i.e. the direction is opposite to MET62). (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, mechanisms responsible for the elicitor-induced production of secondary metabolites of plant cells have not yet been fully elucidated. Here, we report that treatment of Catharanthus roseus cell suspension cultures with PB90, a protein elicitor from Phytophthora boehmeriae, induced rapid increases of abscisic acid (ABA) and nitric oxide (NO), subsequently followed by the enhancement of catharanthine production and up-regulation of Str and Tdc, two important genes in catharanthine biosynthesis. PB90-induced catharanthine production and the gene expression were suppressed by the ABA inhibitor and NO scavenger respectively, showing that ABA and NO are essential for the elicitor-induced catharanthine biosynthesis. The relationship between ABA and NO in mediating catharanthine biosynthesis was further investigated. Treatment of the cells with ABA triggered NO accumulation and induced catharanthine production and up-regulation of Str and Tdc. ABA-induced catharanthine production and gene expressions were suppressed by the NO scavenger. Conversely, exogenous application of NO did not stimulate ABA generation and treatment with ABA inhibitor did not suppress NO-induced catharanthine production and gene expressions. Together, the results showed that both NO and ABA were involved in PB90-induced catharanthine biosynthesis of C. roseus cells. Furthermore, our data demonstrated that ABA acted upstream of NO in the signaling cascade leading to PB90-induced catharanthine biosynthesis of C. roseus cells.

Interpreting Concept Sketches	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS			English	Article								Concept sketches are popularly used by designers to convey pose and function of products. Understanding such sketches, however, requires special skills to form a mental 3D representation of the product geometry by linking parts across the different sketches and imagining the intermediate object configurations. Hence, the sketches can remain inaccessible to many, especially non-designers. We present a system to facilitate easy interpretation and exploration of concept sketches. Starting from crudely specified incomplete geometry, often inconsistent across the different views, we propose a globally-coupled analysis to extract part correspondence and inter-part junction information that best explain the different sketch views. The user can then interactively explore the abstracted object to gain better understanding of the product functions. Our key technical contribution is performing shape analysis without access to any coherent 3D geometric model by reasoning in the space of inter-part relations. We evaluate our system on various concept sketches obtained from popular product design books and websites.

The unique structures of axons and dendrites (collectively neurites) may cause them to be particularly vulnerable to the accumulation of protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Autophagy is a catabolic mechanism in which cells clear protein aggregates and damaged organelles. Basal autophagy occurs continuously as a housekeeping function, and can be acutely expanded in response to stress or injury. Emerging evidence shows that insufficient or excessive autophagy contributes to neuritic degeneration. Here, we review the recent progress that has begun to reveal the role of autophagy in neurite function and degeneration.

Among various factors affecting the value of emergency exercises, including their design, development, conduct, evaluation, and improvement planning, this paper emphasizes the focal role of evacuees and their behavior. We address two concerns: What are the intrinsic reasons behind human behavior? How do we model and exhibit human behavior? We review studies investigating the mechanisms of psychological behavior and crowd evacuation animation. A comprehensive analysis of logical patterns of behavior and crowd evacuation is presented first. The interactive effects of information (objective and subjective), psychology (panic, small groups, and conflicting roles), and six kinds of behavior contribute to a more effective understanding of an emergency scene and assist in making scientific decisions. Based on these studies, a wide range of perspectives on crowd formation and evacuation animation models is summarized. Collision avoidance is underlined as a special topic. Finally, this paper highlights some of the technical challenges and key questions to be addressed by future developments in this rapidly developing field.

The design and fine-tuning of carbohydrate-based catalysts is facilitated by the multiple functional groups present within this class of compounds. This strategy has provided unique ligand moieties which combine the performance of "privileged catalysts" with increased flexibility and accessibility. With the development of sugar-based ligands in selective catalysis, D-glucosamine has been selected as a cheap and readily available chiral scaffold for the synthesis of a series of novel ligands and organocatalysts. D-glucosamine-derived chiral catalysts has gained continuous increasing interest in asymmetric reactions. In this review, key development of asymmetric reactions catalyzed by D-glucosamine-derived chiral catalysts is summarized.

However, the biosynthetic pathway of these secondary metabolites is largely unknown. In present study, a cDNA sequence (DnTR2) that encodes a peptide with high similarity to known tropinone reductase (TR) was cloned from D. nobile Lindl. Sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis showed that DnTR2 was evolutionarily distant from those well-characterized subgroups of TRs. qRT-PCR revealed that DnTR2 was expressed constitutively in all three vegetative organs (leaves, sterns and roots) and was regulated by methyl jasmonate (MeJA), salicylic acid (SA) and nitrogen oxide (NO). Catalytic activity analysis using recombinant protein found that DnTR2 was not able to reduce tropinone, but reduced the two structural analogs of tropinone, 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride and 4-methylcyclohexanone. Structural modeling and comparison suggested that the substrate specificity of TRs may not be determined by their phylogenetic relationships but by the amino acids that compose the substrate binding pocket. To verify this hypothesis, a site-directed mutagenesis was performed and it successfully restored the DnTR2 with tropinone reduction activity. Our results also showed that the substrate specificity of TRs was determined by a few residues that compose the substrate binding pocket which may have an important role for directed selecting of TRs with designated substrate specificities.

Heat shock protein 60 is one of the pathogenic components of C. pneumonia that is closely associated with the inflammatory disorders. However, the molecular basis for the immunopathologic property of chlamydial heat shock protein (cHSP60) has not been elucidated. In this article, we report that MAPK kinase 3 (MKK3) is essential for cHSP60-induced lung inflammation, because MKK3-knockout mice displayed significantly reduced lung neutrophil accumulation and decreased production of proinflammatory mediators, correlating with the alleviated inflammatory response in lung tissues. Mechanistically, p38 kinase was selectively activated by MKK3 in response to cHSP60 and activated NF-kappa B by stimulating the nuclear kinase, mitogen-and stress-activated protein kinase 1. The specific knockdown of mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 in macrophages resulted in a defective phosphorylation of NF-kappa B/RelA at Ser(276) but had no apparent effect on RelA translocation. Furthermore, TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 was found to relay the signal to MKK3 from TLR4, the major receptor that sensed cHSP60 in the initiation of the inflammatory response.

With the pervasiveness of location-acquisition technologies, research on measuring mobile user similarity based on their trajectories has attracted a lot of attention. However, trajectories imply only short-term mobile regularities, and thus users' long-term activity similarity is difficult to be captured. In this paper, we address the problem of mining users' long-term activity similarity based on their trajectories. To solve this problem, we propose a two-stage approach. At the first stage, the notion of routine activity is proposed to capture users' long-term activity regularities. The routine activities of a user are extracted from his/her daily trajectories. At the second stage, user similarity is calculated hierarchically based on the extracted routine activities. Finally, we evaluated our approach based on both real and artificial datasets. The experimental results show that users with different profiles can be discriminated on the basis of our similarity metric, and thus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

The RGD motif can be combined with integrins overexpressed on the tumor neovasculature and tumor cells with a certain affinity, becoming the new target for imaging agents, and drugs, and gene delivery for tumor treatment. Further, RGD as a biomimetic peptide can also promote cell adherence to the matrix, prevent cell apoptosis and accelerate new tissue regeneration. Functionalizing material surfaces with RGD can improve cell/biomaterial interactions, which facilitates the generation of tissue-engineered constructs. This paper reviews the main functions and advantages of RGD, describes the applications of RGD in imaging agents, drugs, gene delivery for tumor therapy, and highlights the role of RGD in promoting the development of tissue engineering (bone regeneration, cornea repair, artificial neovascularization) in recent years.

As microorganisms are generally considered to be the best indicators of soil pollution, the diversity of bacterial communities in the soil around an e-waste recycling workshop in the Taizhou e-waste recycling area of China was studied using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The results indicated that the PCBs content in the soil decreased with increasing distance from the recycling workshop. Moreover, a gradual change in soil bacteria diversity along the PCBs pollution gradient was observed. Furthermore, the predominance of Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes was found on the basis of sequence analysis and some highly similar subsequences of microorganisms were also found to be closely related to the catabolism of PCBs and other organic compounds. In a word, our results indicated that PCBs pollutants had an evident impact on the structure of the soil microbial community and the enriched microbes might serve to decompose PCBs in soil.

Neurogenesis is required for behavioral recovery after injury in the visual system of Xenopus laevis	JOURNAL OF COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY			English	Article						retinotectal system; optic tectum; brain damage; visual avoidance behavior; cell proliferation; stem cell; neural progenitor cell; musashi; PH3; N--tubulin; injury response	SPINAL-CORD REGENERATION; OPTIC TECTUM; ADULT NEUROGENESIS; CELL-PROLIFERATION; BETA-TUBULIN; IN-VIVO; COGNITIVE RECOVERY; PROGENITOR CELLS; BRAIN-INJURY; STEM-CELLS	Nonmammalian vertebrates have a remarkable capacity to regenerate brain tissue in response to central nervous system (CNS) injury. Nevertheless, it is not clear whether animals recover lost function after injury or whether injury-induced cell proliferation mediates recovery. We address these questions using the visual system and visually-guided behavior in Xenopus laevis tadpoles. We established a reproducible means to produce a unilateral focal injury to optic tectal neurons without damaging retinotectal axons. We then assayed a tectally-mediated visual avoidance behavior to evaluate behavioral impairment and recovery. Focal ablation of part of the optic tectum prevents the visual avoidance response to moving stimuli. Animals recover the behavior over the week following injury. Injury induces a burst of proliferation of tectal progenitor cells based on phospho-histone H3 immunolabeling and experiments showing that Musashi-immunoreactive tectal progenitors incorporate the thymidine analog chlorodeoxyuridine after injury. Pulse chase experiments indicate that the newly-generated cells differentiate into N--tubulin-immunoreactive neurons. Furthermore, in vivo time-lapse imaging shows that Sox2-expressing neural progenitors divide in response to injury and generate neurons with elaborate dendritic arbors. These experiments indicate that new neurons are generated in response to injury. To test if neurogenesis is necessary for recovery from injury, we blocked cell proliferation in vivo and found that recovery of the visual avoidance behavior is inhibited by drugs that block cell proliferation. Moreover, behavioral recovery is facilitated by changes in visual experience that increase tectal progenitor cell proliferation. Our data indicate that neurogenesis in the optic tectum is critical for recovery of visually-guided behavior after injury. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:22622278, 2013. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

L. bulgaricus was encapsulated in alginate-milk microspheres prepared by extrusion method. Around 100% encapsulation yield was achieved. The tolerance of encapsulated L. bulgaricus to adverse environments such as low pH (pH 2.0 and 2.5), high concentration of bile salt (1.0% and 2.0%) and long time storage (1 month), was investigated. Release characteristic of encapsulated L. bulgaricus in Simulated Intestine Fluid (SIF) was also studied. The results showed that encapsulation could improve the tolerance of L. bulgaricus to adverse environments. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus did not change after 120 min incubation in Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF) pH 2.5. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus could be kept more than 8 log CFU/g after 120 min incubation in SGF pH 2.0. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus in 1% bile salt solution was reduced from 9.98 log CFU/g microspheres to 9.24 and 8.48 log CFU/g microspheres after 1 and 2 h incubation, respectively. Around 1.3 and 2.1 log CFU/g microspheres were reduced after 1 and 2 h exposure in 2% bile salt solution, respectively. Full viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus could be preserved after 1 month's storage at 4 degrees C. L. bulgaricus encapsulated in alginate-milk microspheres could be completely released in 1 h. These studies demonstrated encapsulation of L. bulgaricus in alginate-milk microspheres is an effective protection technique against extreme simulated gastrointestinal environment.

The simultaneous phase separation and dewetting in PMMA/SAN [poly(methyl methacrylate) and poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile)] blend ultrathin films upon solvent annealing have been observed for the first time in our previous work. In this work, film thickness and annealing solvent dependence of phase behaviors in this system has been investigated using atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS). On one hand, both vertical phase separation and dewetting take place upon selective solvent vapor annealing, leading to the formation of droplet/mimic-film structures with various sizes (depending on original film thickness). On the other hand, the whole blend film dewets the substrate and produces dispersed droplets on the silicon oxide upon common solvent annealing. GISAXS results demonstrate the phase separation in the big dewetted droplets resulted from the thicker film (39.8 nm). In contrast, no period structure is detected in small droplets from the thinner film (5.1 nm and 9.7 nm). This investigation indicates that dewetting and phase separation in PMMA/SAN blend film upon solvent annealing depend crucially on the film thickness and the atmosphere during annealing.

We investigated both intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity in twenty patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and 20 healthy controls using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and functional connectivity methods were used to analyze the intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity, respectively. Compared with healthy controls, patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder showed significantly increased ReHo in the orbitofrontal cortex, cerebellum, and insula, and decreased ReHo in the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, caudate, and inferior occipital cortex. Based on ReHo results, we determined functional connectivity differences between the orbitofrontal cortex and other brain regions in both patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and controls. We found abnormal functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral anterior cingulate cortex in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder compared with healthy controls. Moreover, ReHo in the orbitofrontal cortex was correlated with the duration of obsessive-compulsive disorder. These findings suggest that increased intra- and inter-regional synchronized activity in the orbitofrontal cortex may have a key role in the pathology of obsessive-compulsive disorder. In addition to orbitofronto-striato-thalamic circuitry, brain regions such as the insula and cerebellum may also be involved in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder.

Neuroimaging studies have suggested that these behavioral disturbances are associated with abnormal functional connectivity among brain regions. However, the alterations in the structural connections that underlie these behavioral and functional deficits remain poorly understood. Here, we used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and probabilistic tractography method to examine whole-brain white matter (WM) structural connectivity in 30 drug-naive boys with ADHD and 30 healthy controls. The WM networks of the human brain were constructed by estimating inter-regional connectivity probability. The topological properties of the resultant networks (e.g., small-world and network efficiency) were then analyzed using graph theoretical approaches. Nonparametric permutation tests were applied for between-group comparisons of these graphic metrics. We found that both the ADHD and control groups showed an efficient small-world organization in the whole-brainWM networks, suggesting a balance between structurally segregated and integrated connectivity patterns. However, relative to controls, patients with ADHD exhibited decreased global efficiency and increased shortest path length, with the most pronounced efficiency decreases in the left parietal, frontal, and occipital cortices. Intriguingly, theADHDgroup showed decreased structural connectivity in the prefrontal-dominant circuitry and increased connectivity in the orbitofrontal-striatal circuitry, and these changes significantly correlated with the inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms, respectively. The present study shows disrupted topological organization of large-scale WM networks in ADHD, extending our understanding of how structural disruptions of neuronal circuits underlie behavioral disturbances in patients with ADHD.

The highly related group C Sox genes Sox4 and Sox11 are widely expressed in the development of mouse retina and share a similar expression pattern with each other in this process. Here, to investigate the roles of Sox4 and Sox11 in the retinal development, Sox4, Sox11, and Sox4/Sox11 conditional knock-out (CKO) mice with deletion of Sox4, Sox11, and Sox4/Sox11 in retinas were generated. Our studies demonstrated that targeted disruption of Sox4 or Sox11 in retinas caused a moderate reduction of generation of RGCs. However, a complete loss of RGCs was observed in Sox4/Sox11-null retinas, suggesting the two genes play similar roles in the development of RGCs. Our further analysis confirms that Sox4 and Sox11 function redundantly to regulate the generation of RGCs at early embryonic stages as well as the survival of RGCs at late embryonic stages. In addition, we demonstrated that loss of Math5 impairs the expression of Sox4 and Sox11 in the ganglion cell layer while deletion of Brn3b has no effect on the expression of Sox4 and Sox11. Taken together, these findings elucidate SoxC genes as essential contributors to maintain the survival of RGCs, and imply their intermediate position between Math5 and Brn3b in the genetic hierarchy of RGC development.

Spatial vs. Temporal Features in ICA of Resting-State fMRI - A Quantitative and Qualitative Investigation in the Context of Response Inhibition	PLOS ONE			English	Article							DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; FUNCTIONAL-CONNECTIVITY; HUMAN BRAIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; CINGULATE CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; SIGNAL; STOP; ATTENTION	Independent component analysis (ICA) can identify covarying functional networks in the resting brain. Despite its relatively widespread use, the potential of the temporal information (unlike spatial information) obtained by ICA from resting state fMRI (RS-fMRI) data is not always fully utilized. In this study, we systematically investigated which features in ICA of resting-state fMRI relate to behaviour, with stop signal reaction time (SSRT) in a stop-signal task taken as a test case. We did this by correlating SSRT with the following three kinds of measure obtained from RS-fMRI data: (1) the amplitude of each resting state network (RSN) (evaluated by the standard deviation of the RSN timeseries), (2) the temporal correlation between every pair of RSN timeseries, and (3) the spatial map of each RSN. For multiple networks, we found significant correlations not only between SSRT and spatial maps, but also between SSRT and network activity amplitude. Most of these correlations are of functional interpretability. The temporal correlations between RSN pairs were of functional significance, but these correlations did not appear to be very sensitive to finding SSRT correlations. In addition, we also investigated the effects of the decomposition dimension, spatial smoothing and Z-transformation of the spatial maps, as well as the techniques for evaluating the temporal correlation between RSN timeseries. Overall, the temporal information acquired by ICA enabled us to investigate brain function from a complementary perspective to the information provided by spatial maps.

Herein, we fabricated epoxy composites with highly dispersed graphene via a facile surfactant-assisted process, and investigated the correlations between surface modification, morphologies, dispersion, re-agglomeration behaviour and interfacial interaction of graphene and the corresponding thermal and mechanical properties of the composites. It is found that the surfactant treatments of graphene are effective to improve their dispersion stability in water and inhibit their re-agglomeration during the curing of resin. Scanning and transmission electron microscopy analysis demonstrates that the dispersion/exfoliation level of graphene in the composites is greatly improved after surface treatments. These above ameliorating effects along with improved interface between the matrix and graphene arising from the hydrophilic and hydrophobic molecules of non-ionic surfactant result in increased tensile properties compared with those without surface modification. Moreover, the thermal stability of the graphene/epoxy composites is slightly enhanced over that of neat epoxy. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Evidence for two energy gaps and Fermi liquid behavior in the SrPt2As2 superconductor	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							KADOWAKI-WOODS RATIO; CRITICAL-FIELD; TEMPERATURE	We report a detailed calorimetric study on single crystals of the 5d-transition metal pnictide SrPt2As2 with a superconducting critical temperature T-c similar to 5 K. The peculiar field dependence of the electronic specific heat coefficient gamma can be decomposed into two linear components. Moreover, the temperature evolution of the electronic specific heat below T-c is best described by a two-gap model. These findings suggest that two energy gaps are associated with the superconductivity. In parallel, we show that the spin-lattice relaxation time T-1, through nuclear magnetic resonance measurement, obeys the so-called Korringa relation well. This, along with the T-2 dependence of resistivity at low temperatures, points to a Fermi liquid ground state in this material.	[Xu, Xiaofeng; Chen, B.; Chen, Bin; Niu, C. Q.; Li, Y. K.; Yang, J.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a Charged Charmoniumlike Structure in e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-) J/psi at root s=4.26 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We study the process e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-) J/psi at a center-of-mass energy of 4.260 GeV using a 525 pb(-1) data sample collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The Born cross section is measured to be (62.9 +/- 1.9 +/- 3.7) pb, consistent with the production of the Y(4260). We observe a structure at around 3.9 GeV/c(2) in the pi(+/-) J/psi mass spectrum, which we refer to as the Z(c)(3900). If interpreted as a new particle, it is unusual in that it carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. A fit to the pi(+/-) J/psi invariant mass spectrum, neglecting interference, results in a mass of (3899.0 +/- 3.6 +/- 4.9) MeV/c(2) and a width of (46 +/- 10 +/- 20) MeV. Its production ratio is measured to be R = (sigma(e(+)e(-) -> pi(+/-) Z(c)(3900)(-/+) -> pi(+)pi(-) J/psi)/sigma(e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-) J/psi)) = (21.5 +/- 3.3 +/- 7.5)%. In all measurements the first errors are statistical and the second are systematic.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H. S.; Chen, J.

The elucidation of metastasis suppressors may offer therapeutic opportunities if their mechanisms of action can be elucidated and tractably exploited. In this study, we investigated the clinical and functional significance of the transcription factor activating transcription factor 3 (ATF3) in bladder cancer metastasis. Gene expression analysis revealed that decreased ATF3 was associated with bladder cancer progression and reduced survival of patients with bladder cancer. Correspondingly, ATF3 overexpression in highly metastatic bladder cancer cells decreased migration in vitro and experimental metastasis in vivo. Conversely, ATF3 silencing increased the migration of bladder cancer cells with limited metastatic capability in the absence of any effect on proliferation. In keeping with their increased motility, metastatic bladder cancer cells had increased numbers of actin filaments. Moreover, ATF3 expression correlated with expression of the actin filament severing protein gelsolin (GSN). Mechanistic studies revealed that ATF3 upregulated GSN, whereas ATF3 silencing reduced GSN levels, concomitant with alterations in the actin cytoskeleton. We identified six ATF3 regulatory elements in the first intron of the GSN gene confirmed by chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis. Critically, GSN expression reversed the metastatic capacity of bladder cancer cells with diminished levels of ATF3. Taken together, our results indicate that ATF3 suppresses metastasis of bladder cancer cells, at least in part through the upregulation of GSN-mediated actin remodeling. These findings suggest ATF3 coupled with GSN as prognostic markers for bladder cancer metastasis. (c) 2013 AACR.

The IC50 of Cu(II) on Anammox mixed culture was 12.9 mg L-1. The long-term effects of Cu(II) on the Anammox process were examined in two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors, a test reactor (R-1) and a control reactor (R-0). The performance of R-1 was strongly inhibited by Cu(II) at a concentration of 5 mg L-1 with a specific Anammox activity of 0.9 mg TN g(-1) volatile suspended solids h(-1), which corresponded to a 94% loss in activity. Without Cu(II) addition, the recovery phase of R-1 was consistent with the typical characteristics seen in an Anammox process startup, with a good fit to both the modified Boltzmann model (R-2 = 0.9860) and the modified Stover-Kincannon model (R-2 = 0.9701). Maintaining the influent Cu(II) at a low level of no more than 4 mg L-1 was necessary for preventing the copper inhibition. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influence of different end-capping agents on the composition and properties of the MQ resins has been investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis and differential scanning calorimetry results indicate that when the MQ resins are end capped with DMPES instead of MDPES, the resins were more easily purified and almost no high boiling point residuals were found in the phenyl MQ resins. The refractive indexes of the MQ resins were significantly affected by the phenyl group and their values could be adjusted by changing the amount of DMPES. The structures of the resins were characterized by 1H-NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. The M/Q ratios in the prepared MQ resins were calculated from the 1H-NMR spectra or from elemental analysis or both. The M/Q values obtained agreed well with the changes of appearance and thermal stabilities of the MQ resins. The thermal stabilities of the MQ resins were greatly enhanced when DMPES was used. Phenyl-modified MQ resins were in the form of white powders due to the rigidity of the phenyl group while methyl MQ resins exhibited a range of appearances, from transparent liquids to white powders, with the reduction of M/Q values. The method developed to calculate the M/Q values is useful for the characterization of MQ resins and their derivatives. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym.

J	Yang, XF; Zheng, T; Che, LM; Luo, ZH				Yang, Xiong-Fa; Zheng, Tao; Che, Li-Ming; Luo, Zheng-Hong			A dynamically distributed reactor model for identifying the flow fields in industrial loop propylene polymerization reactors	JOURNAL OF APPLIED POLYMER SCIENCE			English	Article						kinetics; polyolefins; theory; modeling	PARTICLE-SIZE DISTRIBUTION; CATALYZED OLEFIN POLYMERIZATION; HETEROGENEOUS ZIEGLER-NATTA; RESIDENCE TIME DISTRIBUTION; ETHYLENE POLYMERIZATION; HEAT-TRANSFER; STEADY-STATE; SIMULATION; COPOLYMERIZATION; PREDICTION	The use of distributed parameter model is becoming a common approach for simulating liquidsolid flow in loop polymerization reactors. However, there are still several issues with it. One of them is the absence of modeling of distributed pressure, as no thermodynamic state-equation is incorporated into the model. In this work, inner pressure of the reactor was associated with temperature using a thermodynamic state-equation for high-pressure liquid. The thermodynamic state-equation was solved together with a dynamically distributed reactor model based on the mass, energy, and momentum conservation as well as polymerization kinetics to predict the dynamic trajectories of component concentration, temperature, pressure, and bulk mass velocity in the reactor. Industrial steady-state data were used for model validation. The application of the model was demonstrated by simulating the effect of recycle ratio on the above distributed reactor parameters.

Traditionally, they are the same as each other. Namely, they are both clockwise or both counterclockwise. Moreover, the chiralities are determined by the topological charges of spiral waves, and thus they are conserved quantities. After the inwardly propagating spirals were experimentally observed, the relationship between the chiralities and the one between the chiralities and the topological charges are no longer preserved. The chiralities thus become more complex than ever before. As a result, there is now a desire to further study them. In this paper, the chiralities and their transition properties for all kinds of spiral waves are systemically studied in the framework of the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation, and the general relationships both between the chiralities and between the chiralities and the topological charges are obtained. The investigation of some other models, such as the FitzHugh-Nagumo model, the nonuniform Oregonator model, the modified standard model, etc., is also discussed for comparison.

This may be related to variation in venom components associated with the ontogenetic shift in diet. We used the short-tailed pit viper Gloydius brevicaudus that displays ontogenetic shifts in diet to examine whether the species displays a neonate-to-adult transition of snake venomics. Venoms from neonates and adults were pooled separately and then analyzed by 2-DE, MALDI-TOF-MS/MS and iTRAQ technologies. The 2-DE profiles showed that the main components in both types of venoms were acidic proteins, and that neonates and adults differed in snake venomics. The proteins with molecular masses/pI of similar to 12-39 kDa/4.0-4.6, similar to 36-57 kDa/5.6-7.0 and similar to 65-92 kDa/4.5-5.8 were more abundant in the neonate venom, while the proteins with molecular masses/pl of similar to 12-19 kDa/4.6-6.4, similar to 23-30 kDa/5.4-6.3 and similar to 35-62 kDa/4.6-5.4 were more abundant in the adult venom. The iTRAQ analysis showed quantitative changes in various toxin families, including mainly metalloproteinases, serine proteinases, phospholipase A(2)s and C-type lectins. The N-deglycosylation analysis demonstrated that glycosylation was an important posttranslational modification of snake venom. Our results show a neonate-to-adult transition of snake venomics in G. brevicaudus. Such a transition might be driven by the divergence in dietary habits between neonates and adults. Biological significance This study is first to demonstrate a neonate-to-adult transition of snake venomics in G. brevicaudus, and the results will be helpful in predicting and treating clinical pathologic symptoms caused by the snake at different developmental stages.

A recent comparative analysis of REG gamma expression in mouse and human tissues reveals a unique pattern of REG gamma in specific cell types, suggesting undisclosed functions and biological importance of this molecule. Despite the emerging progress made in REG gamma-related studies, how REG gamma function is regulated remains to be explored. In this study, we report for the first time that REG gamma can be acetylated mostly on its lysine 195 (Lys-195) residue by CREB binding protein (CBP), which can be reversed by sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) in mammalian cells. Site-directed mutagenesis abrogated acetylation at Lys-195 and significantly attenuated the capability of REG gamma to degrade its target substrates, p21 and hepatitis C virus core protein. Mechanistically, acetylation at Lys-195 is important for the interactions between REG gamma monomers and ultimately influences REG gamma heptamerization. Biological analysis of cells containing REG gamma-WT or REG gamma-K195R mutant indicates an impact of acetylation on REG gamma-mediated regulation of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. These findings reveal a previously unknown mechanism in the regulation of REG gamma assembly and activity, suggesting a potential venue for the intervention of the ubiquitin-independent REG gamma proteasome activity.

The NBS gene product, NBS1 (p95 or nibrin), is a part of the Mre11-Rad50-NBS1 complex. SIN1 is a component of the mTOR/Rictor/SIN1 complex mediating the activation of Akt. Here we show that NBS1 interacted with mTOR, Rictor, and SIN1. The specific domains of mTOR, Rictor, or SIN1 interacted with the internal domain (a.a. 221-402) of NBS1. Sucrose density gradient showed that NBS1 was located in the same fractions as the mTOR/Rictor/SIN1 complex. Knockdown of NBS1 decreased the levels of phosphorylated Akt and its downstream targets. Ionizing radiation (IR) increased the NBS1 levels and activated Akt activity. These results demonstrate that NBS1 interacts with the mTOR/Rictor/SIN1 complex through the a. a. 221-402 domain and contributes to the activation of Akt activity.

The formation of the silica shell was attributed to the interfacial deposition of silica species induced by the presence of the transition-metal salt. In addition to the control of the particle morphology, the incorporated transition-metal salts could be used to derivatize the particles and confer additional functionalities to the hollow silica particles. To demonstrate the derivatization, the magnetic hollow silica particles were prepared by converting iron salts to magnetic iron oxides by heat treatment. The particle morphology, size, and size distribution were characterized by transmission electron microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the particle properties strongly depend on the type and the amount of salts, the amount of tetraethoxysilane (TEOS), the pH of the droplets, and the ratios of 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate to aqueous HCl solution. The specific surface area and pore properties were characterized by N-2 sorption measurements. The pore properties and specific surface area could be tuned by varying the amount of salt. Levels of elements and of iron oxides in the magnetic hollow particles were measured by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. Iron was distributed homogenously with silicon and oxygen in the sample. The Magnetization measured by a magnetic property measurement system confirmed the successful conversion of the iron salts to magnetic iron oxides.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of J/psi -> omega p(p)over-bar at BESIII	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							THRESHOLD ENHANCEMENT; STATE	The decay J/psi -> omega p (p) over bar has been studied, using 225.3 X 10(6) J/psi events accumulated at BESIII. No significant enhancement near the p (p) over bar invariant-mass threshold [denoted as X(p (p) over bar)] is observed. The upper limit of the branching fraction B(J/psi -> omega X(p (p) over bar) -> omega p (p) over bar is determined to be 3.9 X 10(-6) at the 95% confidence level. The branching fraction of J/psi -> omega p (p) over bar is measured to be B(J/psi -> omega p (p) over bar) = (9.0 +/- 0.2(stat) +/- 0. 9(syst) X 10(-4).	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J.

J	Zeng, A; Zhang, CJ				Zeng, An; Zhang, Cheng-Jun			Ranking spreaders by decomposing complex networks	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Complex networks; Network decomposition; Spreading	COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; CENTRALITY; ORGANIZATION; MODEL	Ranking the nodes' ability of spreading in networks is crucial for designing efficient strategies to hinder spreading in the case of diseases or accelerate spreading in the case of information dissemination. In the well-known k-shell method, nodes are ranked only according to the links between the remaining nodes (residual links) while the links connecting to the removed nodes (exhausted links) are entirely ignored. In this Letter, we propose a mixed degree decomposition (MDD) procedure in which both the residual degree and the exhausted degree are considered. By simulating the epidemic spreading process on real networks, we show that the MDD method can outperform the k-shell and degree methods in ranking spreaders. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Observers were presented with a colour cue (to hold in working memory or to merely identify) and subsequently had to indicate which of the two different-coloured objects presented simultaneously on the screen appeared bigger (or smaller). One of the two objects for size judgements had the same colour as the cue (matching stimulus) and the other did not (mismatching stimulus). Perceived object size was decreased by the reappearance of the recently seen cue, as there were more size judgement errors on trials where the matching stimulus was physically bigger (relative to the mismatching stimulus) than on trials where the matching stimulus was physically smaller. The effect occurred regardless of whether the visual cue was actively maintained in working memory or was merely identified. The effect was unlikely generated by the allocation of attention, because shifting attention to a visual stimulus actually increased its perceived size. The findings suggest that visual short-term memory, whether explicit or implicit, can decrease the perceived size of subsequent visual stimuli.

Bladder overdistention was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by an infusion of saline. Forty rats were divided into five groups: DOBO 1, 2, 4 or 8 h groups and the control. Renal function was evaluated using serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN). Apoptotic indices and morphologic changes of the kidney were detected by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labelling (TUNEL) staining and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Compared with the control, rats undergoing 2, 4 or 8 h of overdistention showed significant, time-dependent increases in SCr (12.375 vs. 23.125, 34.375 and 51.500 mu mol/l, respectively), BUN (6.980 vs. 18.689, 25.184 and 32.079 mmol/l, respectively), renal size (1.041 vs. 1.472, 1.484 and 1.634 cm(3), respectively) and renal pelvis separation (0.000 vs. 0.223, 0.320, 0.308 and 0.277 cm, respectively; P<0.01). In the rats, 2, 4 and 8 h of overdistention elicited time-dependent increases in the blood flow rate in the main renal artery (MRA; 44.827 vs. 49.082, 59.688 and 67.123 cm(3)/sec, control vs. DOBO 2, 4 and 8 h), the interlobar renal artery (IRA; 32.095 vs. 39.16 and 51.745 cm3/sec, control vs. DOBO 4 and 8 h) and the segmental renal artery (SRA; 21.171 vs. 24.355 and 25.358 cm(3)/sec, control vs. DOBO 4 and 8 h; P<0.01). TUNEL results showed that prolonged overdistention increased the apoptotic index of renal cells significantly (1.15, 1.77, 3.40, 5.34 and 13.91% for control and DOBO 1, 2, 4 and 8 h, respectively; P<0.01) and TEM indicated that prolonged overdistention resulted in ultrastructural injuries of increased severity. DOBO plays a significant role in the functional and structural impairment of the rat kidney. With increasing duration, the hemodynamic changes, cell apoptosis and ultrastructural injuries of the kidney are more evident, all of which may contribute to the increasingly serious impairment of renal function and morphology.

Global survey on sequence characteristics of plant microRNA genes: Cis-regulatory SNPs in promoters and microRNA precursors	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Plant; microRNA; cis-regulatory SNP; pre-miRNA; conservation	ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; INFORMATION RESOURCE; SMALL RNAS; IDENTIFICATION; RICE; MULTIPLE; DATABASE; GENOME; VARIETIES; ELEMENTS	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are tiny molecules with multiple essential roles in plant growth and development. So far, numerous miRNA families, both highly conserved and species-specific, have been identified and functionally characterized. However, we are still far from a thorough understanding of these molecules, including their sequence characteristics. In this bioinformatics study, cis-acting regulatory elements located within plant miRNA promoters were predicted, and a comprehensive list of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) residing within these cis-elements, designated as cis-regulatory SNPs, was identified. These SNPs potentially contribute to the distinct expression patterns of miRNA genes in various Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) or rice (Oryza sativa) subspecies. Additionally, sequence conservation analysis was carried out for all the currently miRBase-registered pre-miRNAs (precursor miRNAs) belonging to numerous plant species. Together, these analyses provide a basis to gain deeper insights into the biological role of miRNA sequence characteristics.

Although striking dimorphic expressions have been detected at the transcriptional level between the silkworm larval testis and the ovary, the sex-dimorphic expressions at the protein level, have not yet been well characterized. The proteome of silkworm larval gonads was investigated using a shotgun-based identification. A total of 286 and 205 nonredundant proteins were identified from the silkworm testis and ovary, respectively, with a false discovery rate (FDR) lower than 1%. Only 40 and 16 proteins were previously identified, and 246 and 189 proteins were newly identified in the silkworm testis and the ovary, respectively. The gametogenesis mechanism of silkworm was demonstrated using the protein expression profile and bioinformatics analysis. Cellular retinoic acid binding protein (CRABP) showed to be highly abundant in testis, while tubulins were abundant in ovary. Several homologies of Drosophila essential proteins for gametogenesis were identified in silkworm, such as male meiotic arrest gene product ALY and VISMAY in testis, and maternal mRNA localization protein exuperantia and SQUID in ovary. The gene ontology (GO) annotation and pathway analysis provide system-level insights into the sexual dimorphism and gametogenesis.

For both compounds, the zigzag ether-like conformation (z-sSiO/z-sGeO) is found to be the most energetically favorable structure. These z-sSiO and z-sGeO nanosheets have prominent elastic characteristics, which even exhibit an unconventional auxetic behavior with negative Poisson ratios. After oxidation, the semi-metallic nanosheets are transformed into semiconductors with narrow direct band gaps. Due to the anisotropic mechanical and electronic properties, the z-sSiO and z-sGeO possess an axially high intrinsic charge mobility up to the order of 104 cm2/Vs, which is comparable to that of graphene nanoribbons. Our studies demonstrate that the silicene and germanene oxides have peculiar mechanical and electronic properties, which endow these nanostructures for potential applications in nanoelectronics and devices.

However, there is disagreement on the specific functional role of this area in word recognition. Chinese characters, which are dramatically different from Roman alphabets in the visual form and in the form to phonological mapping, provide a unique opportunity to investigate the properties of the VWFA. Specifically, to clarify the orthographic sensitivity in the mid-fusiform cortex, we compared fMRI response amplitudes (Exp. 1) as well as the spatial patterns of response across multiple voxels (Exp. 2) between Chinese characters and stimuli derived from Chinese characters with different orthographic properties. The fMRI response amplitude results suggest the existence of orthographic sensitivity in the VWFA. The results from multi-voxel pattern analysis indicate that spatial distribution of the responses across voxels in the occipitotemporal cortex contained discriminative information between the different types of character-related stimuli. These results together suggest that the orthographic rules are likely represented in a distributed neural network with the VWFA containing the most specific information regarding a stimulus' orthographic regularity.

The experimental evaluation of phenotypically plastic responses to warming is a critical step in understanding the biological effects and adaptive capacity of organisms to future climate warming. Oviparous Scincella modesta live in deeply-shaded habitats and they require low optimal temperatures during embryonic development, which makes them suitable subjects for testing the effects of warming on reproduction. We raised adult females and incubated their eggs under different thermal conditions that mimicked potential climate warming. Female reproduction, embryonic development and hatchling traits were monitored to evaluate the reproductive response to warming. Experimental warming induced females to lay eggs earlier, but it did not affect the developmental stage of embryos at oviposition or the reproductive output. The high temperatures experienced by gravid females during warming treatments reduced the incubation period and increased embryonic mortality. The locomotor performance of hatchlings was not affected by the maternal thermal environment, but it was affected by the warming treatment during embryonic development. Our results suggest that climate warming might have a profound effect on fitness-relevant traits both at embryonic and post-embryonic stages in oviparous lizards.

Given a clip of character animation, our approach generates a static object. Looking at the object at different views, a similar deformation can be observed. To accomplish this challenging mission, we give qualitative and quantitative analysis of hollow-face illusion. Methodology in computer vision and human perception are utilized to design the algorithm. A static object is first generated to satisfy the relative motion illusion constraints. The illusion is then strengthened by back projecting the object to the 3D face space. Considering both "bottom-up" visual signal and "top-down" knowledge, the intended illusion can be generated. Experiments have shown the effectiveness of our algorithm. For example, expression varying illusion on an oil painting can be created by our method. The self-moving objects can be used in applications such as design, entertainment, advertisement, and public safety.

PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Oryza sativa L.; Root-specific promoters; cis-Acting elements	GENE-EXPRESSION; DROUGHT TOLERANCE; HIGH-LEVEL; ARABIDOPSIS; PLANTS; OVEREXPRESSION; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSPORTER; TOBACCO; QUANTIFICATION	Novel root-specific promoters are important for developing methods to drive root-specific gene expression for nutrient and water absorption. RT-PCR (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction) analysis identified high expression levels of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 in root tissues across developmental stages in comparison with the constitutive genes OsAct1 (rice Actin1 gene), OsUbi1 (rice polyubiquitin rubi1 gene), and OsCc1 (rice cytochrome c gene). The copy numbers of Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 were evaluated by qRT-PCR. The results showed that Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 transcripts were highly accumulated in the examined root tissues but were not detected in young embryos or leaves at the indicated days after germination or in the panicle, in contrast to the ubiquitous expression of OsAct1, OsUbi1, and OsCc1. Additionally, the promoter regions of these two genes were linked to the GUSplus reporter gene and transformed into rice. GUS staining of the transgenic plants showed that the Os03g01700 and Os02g37190 promoters were active in primary and secondary roots throughout the developmental stages, except in root hairs. The GUSPlus transcript levels were also highly root-specific in the transgenic rice. Overall, the two promoters are highly active in the root tissues of rice and can be useful for the root-specific enhancement of target gene(s). (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, ferulic acid (FA) and isoferulic acid (IFA) were used as the model compounds to probe the fragmentation mechanisms and the isomeric effects on homolytic cleavage. Elimination of methyl radical and CO2 are the two competing reactions observed in the CID-MS of [FA - H](-) and [IFA - H](-), of which losing methyl radical violates the "even-electron rule". The relative intensity of their product ions is significantly different, and thereby the two isomeric compounds can be differentiated by tandem MS. Theoretical calculations indicate that both the singlet-triplet gap and the excitation energy decrease in the transient structures, as the breaking C-O bond is lengthened. The methyl radical elimination has been rationalized as the intramolecular electronic excitation of a transient structure with an elongating C-O bond. The potential energy diagrams, completed by the addition of the energy barrier of the radical elimination, have provided a reasonable explanation of the different CID-MS behaviors of [FA - H](-) and [IFA - H](-).

Both the monomers show good electrochemical activity. UV-vis absorption studies reveal that the spectra of them are obviously different due to the introduction of the acceptor groups with different polarity, and the compound with NO2 group has lower band gap. Fluorescent spectral studies indicate that the solution of ETCB in DCM exhibits sky-blue emission, while the NDTC hardly displays the fluorescence because of stronger intramolecular charge transfer. Their polymers can be synthesized by electropolymerization, and both the films show well-defined oxidation and reduction process. Spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that PETCB film displays the color change from yellow-green (neutral) to blue-purple (oxidized), while the color change of PNDTC film is from yellow (neutral) to gray (oxidized). Both the polymer films exhibit reasonable optical contrast and switching time. Moreover, the copolymer based on ETCB and 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) is also investigated. The copolymer could show five colors change under different applied potentials and higher optical contrast (50% of 1100 nm) and coloration efficiency (356.88 cm(2) C (1)). (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

The engraftment of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is reported to promote recovery of renal function in animal models of acute kidney injury (AKI). However, it is unknown whether mesenchymal-like progenitors (MPs) derived from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) can mediate similar therapeutic effects. We investigated the responses of recipient renal tissue to engraftment of hESC-MPs and underlying mechanisms of these effects. Methods. We measured blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels of AKI mice with hESC-MPs transplantation and control mice. We performed renal morphology analysis by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy to confirm the renoprotective effects of engrafted hESC-MPs. Proliferation, apoptosis and gene expression of tubular cells were also monitored by immunohistochemistry and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction to investigate the mechanisms that occurred. Results. After transplantation of hESC-MPs into mice with cisplatin-induced AKI, improvements in renal function and recovery from tubular epithelial cell injury were observed. Engrafted hESC-MPs were localized to areas of injured kidney 5 days after cisplatin induction, where they promoted tubular cell proliferation and decreased kidney cell apoptosis. The beneficial effect was further confirmed by the capability of the engrafted cells to up-regulate renal gene expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and pro-survival cytokines. Meanwhile, infusion of these cells reduced renal gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, a chemokine that stimulates monocyte and macrophage infiltration. Conclusions. Our results show that infused hESC-MPs may promote recovery from AKI by regulating related cytokines.

In all, 23 boys with ADHD were scanned twice, under either 10 mg dose of MPH or placebo, in a randomized, cross-over, counterbalanced placebo-controlled design. 32 Matched healthy controls were scanned once for comparison. Seven of the 23 ADHD boys participated in a follow-up 8-week MPH treatment. A regional homogeneity (ReHo) method was applied to characterize the local synchronization of spontaneous brain activity. ADHD boys under placebo compared with controls showed decreased ReHo in bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and increased ReHo in bilateral sensorimotor and parieto-visual cortices. Relative to placebo, MPH upregulated ReHo in bilateral ventral prefrontal cortices and cerebellar vermis, and downregulated ReHo in right parietal and visual areas that overlapped with the abnormally enhanced activities. When under MPH, ReHo differences between patients and controls were no longer observed. The preliminary prediction analysis revealed that the decreased ReHo in right parietal cortex after the acute MPH was positively correlated with the decreased symptom scores after the 8-week MPH treatment in the seven patients. We show that an acute dose of MPH normalized all fronto-parieto-cerebellar dysfunctions in boys with ADHD during the resting state. Preliminary findings furthermore suggest the potential of RS-fMRI as a prognostic imaging tool to identify response to MPH treatment.

The short-term impact of phenol on Anammox activity was determined by a batch test, and an IC50 value of 678.2 mg L-1 was calculated. Anammox granular sludge was equally seeded into two identical upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (R-0 and R-1); synthetic wastewater without phenol was fed to R-0 while with varied phenol was fed to R-1 to study the long-term effects. The performance of R-0 was stable, with a steadily rising nitrogen removal rate of 10.5-21.3 kg N m(-3) day(-1). However, the performance of R-1 was significantly suppressed by an influent phenol concentration of 50 mg L-1, and was recovered and stabilized by applying one or more control strategies. The phenol-mediated inhibition depressed the Anammox activity and biomass, and caused a change of stoichiometric ratios and granule characteristics. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Although FBW7 is required for vascular development, its function in the endothelium remains to be investigated. In this study, we show that FBW7 is an important regulator of endothelial functions, including angiogenesis, leukocyte adhesion and the endothelial barrier integrity. Using RNA interference, we found that the depletion of FBW7 markedly impairs angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo. We identified the zinc finger transcription factor Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) as a physiological target of FBW7 in endothelial cells. Knockdown of FBW7 expression resulted in the accumulation of endogenous KLF2 protein in endothelial cells. FBW7-mediated KLF2 destruction was shown to depend on the phosphorylation of KLF2 via glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK3) at two conserved phosphodegrons. Mutating these phosphodegron motifs abolished the FBW7-mediated degradation and ubiquitination of KLF2. The siRNA-mediated knockdown of FBW7 showed that KLF2 is an essential target of FBW7 in the regulation of endothelial functions. Moreover, FBW7-mediated KLF2 degradation was shown to be critical for angiogenesis in teratomas and in zebrafish development. Taken together, our study suggests a role for FBW7 in the processes of endothelial cell migration, angiogenesis, inflammation and barrier integrity, and provides novel insights into the regulation of KLF2 stability in vivo.

More interestingly, the significance of the phosphine in enhancing the enantioselectivities in the chiral-primary-amine-catalyzed Michael reaction was revealed. Furthermore, we explored the origin of the reaction mechanism in the Michael addition promoted by the dual organocatalytic system. On the basis of experimental results and spectroscopic analysis, such as UV/Vis, fluorescence emission (FL), NMR, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, as well as ESI-MS, we found that the molecular assembly of phosphine and primary amine played a crucial role in this enantioselective reaction, in which a possible supramolecular complex was formed as an effective chiral catalyst through noncovalent molecular interactions of a cinchona alkaloid-derived primary amine with triphenylphosphine.

N.; Zhang, Entao; Xiao, Xiao; Jia, Lei; Yang, Qun; Li, Haijiang; Zhang, Qinglin			Cognitive control in belief-laden reasoning during conclusion processing: An ERP study	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						Belief-bias effect; Cognitive control; Dual processing; Event-related potentials (ERPs); Late positive component (LPC)	BIAS; CONFLICT; LOGIC; RESOLUTION	Belief bias is the tendency to accept conclusions that are compatible with existing beliefs more frequently than those that contradict beliefs. It is one of the most replicated behavioral findings in the reasoning literature. Recently, neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and event-related potentials (ERPs) have provided a new perspective and have demonstrated neural correlates of belief bias that have been viewed as supportive of dual-process theories of belief bias. However, fMRI studies have tended to focus on conclusion processing, while ERPs studies have been concerned with the processing of premises. In the present research, the electrophysiological correlates of cognitive control were studied among 12 subjects using high-density ERPs. The analysis was focused on the conclusion presentation phase and was limited to normatively sanctioned responses to valid-believable and valid-unbelievable problems. Results showed that when participants gave normatively sanctioned responses to problems where belief and logic conflicted, a more positive ERP deflection was elicited than for normatively sanctioned responses to nonconflict problems. This was observed from -400 to -200ms prior to the correct response being given. The positive component is argued to be analogous to the late positive component (LPC) involved in cognitive control processes. This is consistent with the inhibition of empirically anomalous information when conclusions are unbelievable. These data are important in elucidating the neural correlates of belief bias by providing evidence for electrophysiological correlates of conflict resolution during conclusion processing. Moreover, they are supportive of dual-process theories of belief bias that propose conflict detection and resolution processes as central to the explanation of belief bias. La croyance biaisee est la tendance a accepter des conclusions qui sont compatibles avec les croyances existantes plus souvent que celles qui contredisent les croyances. Il s'agit de l'un des resultats le plus souvent obtenu dans la documentation sur le raisonnement. Recemment, les etudes de la neuroimagerie utilisant l'imagerie par resonnance magnetique fonctionnelle (IRMf) et les potentiels cognitifs lies a un evenement (PCE) ont fourni une nouvelle perspective et ont mis en evidence des correlats neuraux du biais de croyance qui ont ete interpretes comme appuyant les theories du traitement double de la croyance biaisee. Toutefois, les etudes d'IRMf ont surtout porte sur le traitement de la conclusion, alors que les etudes de PCE se sont interessees au traitement des premisses. Dans la presente recherche, les correlats electrophysiologiques du controle cognitif ont ete etudies aupres de 12 sujets en utilisant les PCE a haute densite. L'analyse a ete centree sur la phase de la presentation de la conclusion et a ete limitee aux reponses normativement sanctionnees a des problemes croyables valides et incroyables valides. Les resultats montrent que lorsque les participants donnaient des reponses normativement sanctionnees a des problemes oU la croyance et la logique etaient en conflit, une deflexion du PCE plus positive etait obtenue que pour les reponses normativement sanctionnees a des problemes non conflictuels. Cela a ete observe de -400 a -200ms avant que la reponse correcte soit donnee. Nous soutenons que la composante positive est analogue a la composante positive tardive (CPT) impliquee dans les processus cognitifs de controle. Cela est coherent avec l'inhibition de l'information empiriquement anormale lorsque les conclusions sont incroyables. Ces donnees sont importantes pour comprendre les correlats neuraux de la croyance biaisee en fournissant la preuve de correlats electrophysiologiques de resolution de conflit durant le traitement de la conclusion. De plus, elles confortent les theories du traitement double de la croyance biaisee qui soutient que les traitements de la detection du conflit et de la resolution sont au cOEur de l'explication de la croyance biaisee. El sesgo de la creencia es la tendencia a aceptar con mas frecuencia las conclusiones que son compatibles con las creencias existentes que las que contradicen las creencias. Este es uno de los hallazgos comportamentales mas replicados en la literatura del razonamiento. Recientemente, los estudios de neuroimagen que utilizan las imagenes de resonancia magnetica funcional (IRMf) y los potenciales relacionados con eventos (PREs) han proporcionado una nueva perspectiva y han demostrado correlatos neurales del sesgo de creencia que han sido vistos como un apoyo a las teorias de proceso dual del sesgo de creencia. Sin embargo, los estudios de IRMf han tendido a centrarse en el procesamiento de la conclusion, mientras que los estudios de PREs se han ocupado del procesamiento de las premisas. En la presente investigacion, se estudiaron los correlatos electrofisiologicos del control cognitivo en 12 sujetos usando PREs de alta densidad. El analisis se centro en la fase de presentacion de conclusiones y se limito a las respuestas normativamente sancionadas a los problemas validos creibles y no creibles. Los resultados mostraron que cuando los participantes daban respuestas normativamente sancionadas a los problemas donde la creencia y la logica estaban en conflicto, se obtenia una desviacion de ERP mas positiva que para las respuestas normativamente sancionados a problemas no conflictivos. Esto se observo entre -400y -200ms antes de que la respuesta correcta fuera dada. Se argumenta que el componente positivo es analogo al componente positivo tardio (CPT??) involucrado en los procesos de control cognitivo. Esto es consistente con la inhibicion de la informacion empirica anomala cuando las conclusiones son increibles. Estos datos son importantes en la aclaracion de los correlatos neurales del sesgo de creencia, proporcionando evidencia de los correlatos electrofisiologicos de la resolucion de conflictos durante el procesamiento de conclusiones. Por otra parte, son de apoyo a las teorias de proceso dual del sesgo de creencia que proponen la deteccion de conflictos y procesos de resolucion como elemento central de la explicacion del sesgo de creencia.

The cross-linker was transferred to the CS nanodroplets via the evaporation from its aqueous solution and diffusion through the continuous phase. The formation of cross-linked CS nanohydrogels was confirmed by the morphological investigation during the reaction and the successful preparation of acidic aqueous dispersion of CS nanohydrogels. The size and size distribution of the CS nanodroplets and nanohydrogels were characterized by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle morphology of CS nanohydrogels was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The influence of the synthetic parameters on the particle properties and colloidal stability was investigated with respect to sonication time, surfactant type and amount, type of low polarity solvent, and concentration of CS solution. The cross-linked CS nanohydrogels could be easily re-dispersed in water, and showed a pH sensitivity.

XBP1 promoter polymorphism modulates platinum-based chemotherapy gastrointestinal toxicity for advanced non-small cell lung cancer patients	LUNG CANCER			English	Article						Clinical outcome; Molecular analysis; Non-small cell lung cancer; Pharmacogenomics; Platinum-based chemotherapy; X-box binding protein 1	ENDOPLASMIC-RETICULUM STRESS; INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; GENETIC RISK; ER STRESS; ASSOCIATION; DIFFERENTIATION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; ACTIVATION; APOPTOSIS; PROTEINS	Background: The X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a critical transcription factor in the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, which is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. Here, we investigated whether the regulatory variant rs2269577 of the XBP1 gene influences clinical outcome in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients and methods: We recruited 663 Chinese patients with advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based regimens and assessed the association between rs2269577 and clinical outcome. Subsequent functional analyses, including real-time quantitative PCR and dual-luciferase assays, were performed to explore possible molecular mechanisms. Results: The GIG genotype of rs2269577 was significantly associated with severe gastrointestinal toxicity compared with the homozygous C/C genotype (P= 0.012, odds ratio = 2.755), particularly in the female, performance status 0-1, and adenocarcinoma subgroups. No significant relevance was found between rs2269577 and treatment efficacy. In gastric epithelial cells, in vitro molecular analyses demonstrated that XBP1 mRNA expression levels decreased after treatment with cisplatin and the G allele of rs2269577 weakened the transcriptional activity of the XBP1 promoter. Conclusion: This is the first study to evaluate the effect of XBP1 polymorphism on severe chemotherapy-related adverse outcomes in platinum-treated advanced NSCLC patients using both pharmacogenomics and functional molecular analyses.

Enhancement of low-temperature tolerance in transgenic tomato plants overexpressing Lefad7 through regulation of trienoic fatty acids	PHOTOSYNTHETICA			English	Article						chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene; Lycopersicon esculentum	CHLOROPLAST OMEGA-3-FATTY-ACID DESATURASE; OXIDATIVE STRESS; CHILLING STRESS; ARABIDOPSIS DEFICIENT; LIPID-PEROXIDATION; COLD TOLERANCE; IN-SITU; GENE; TOBACCO; PHOTOINHIBITION	We studied how tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) chloroplast omega-3 fatty acid desaturase gene (Lefad7) overexpression enhanced low-temperature (LT) tolerance in transgenic tomato plants. In these plants, the content of linolenic acid (18:3) markedly increased and, correspondingly, the content of linoleic acid (18:2) decreased. Similar changes were found after 6 h under LT (4A degrees C) treatment. Under LT stress, wild type (WT) tomato plants showed a much greater increase in relative electrolyte leakage and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents compared with transgenic plants. Transgenic plants exhibited higher activities of antioxidative enzymes and a lower content of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Transgenic plants maintained a relatively higher level of the net photosynthetic rate (P (N)) and chlorophyll (Chl) content than WT plants under LT stress. Taken together, we suggested that overexpression of Lefad7 enhanced LT tolerance by changing the composition of membrane lipids in tomato plants, with the increased content of trienoic fatty acids and reduced content of dienoic fatty acids that led to series of physiological alterations.

J	Xia, YJ; Li, XM; Shan, ZY				Xia, Yingjie; Li, Xiumei; Shan, Zhenyu			Parallelized Fusion on Multisensor Transportation Data: A Case Study in CyberITS	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INTELLIGENT SYSTEMS			English	Article							TRAVEL-TIME; IMPLEMENTATION; FRAMEWORK; ALGORITHM; QUADTREE; FREEWAY	With increasing requirements on traffic efficiency, environmental quality, energy efficiency, and economic productivity, intelligent transportation systems (ITS) research, which is centered on traffic state evaluation, meets two grand challenges. One is to process heterogeneous transportation data collected from different types of traffic sensors and the other is to reduce the high computation intensity for processing massive transportation data. To overcome both challenges, this paper proposes an approach using parallelized fusion on multisensor transportation data. Parallelized fusion is an embodied case of CyberITS framework, which is developed for the synthesis of cyberinfrastructure and ITS. The fusion functionality is shaped by a rough evidential fusion model (REFM) based on rough set and DempsterShafer evidence theories. The REFM consists of four components, which are sensor data input, bootstrapping rough conversion, hierarchical evidential fusion, and traffic state output. Their computation intensity is centered on conversion and fusion components, which can be optimized by the algorithm- and data-centric parallelization, respectively. Computational experiments for accuracy and efficiency demonstrate that parallelized fusion achieves a distributed, high-performance, and collaborative CyberITS implementation to provide accurate and real-time traffic state evaluation.

Previously, we presented an edge-based method, Relative Specificity Similarity (RSS), which takes the global position of relevant terms into account. However, edge-based semantic similarity metrics are sensitive to the intrinsic structure of GO and simply consider terms at the same level in the ontology to be equally specific nodes, revealing the weaknesses that could be complemented using information content (IC). Results and Conclusions: Here, we used the IC-based nodes to improve RSS and proposed a new method, Hybrid Relative Specificity Similarity (HRSS). HRSS outperformed other methods in distinguishing true protein-protein interactions from false. HRSS values were divided into four different levels of confidence for protein interactions. In addition, HRSS was statistically the best at obtaining the highest average functional similarity among human-mouse orthologs. Both HRSS and the groupwise measure, simGIC, are superior in correlation with sequence and Pfam similarities. Because different measures are best suited for different circumstances, we compared two pairwise strategies, the maximum and the best-match average, in the evaluation. The former was more effective at inferring physical protein-protein interactions, and the latter at estimating the functional conservation of orthologs and analyzing the CESSM datasets. In conclusion, HRSS can be applied to different biological problems by quantifying the functional similarity between gene products. The algorithm HRSS was implemented in the C programming language, which is freely available from http://cmb.bnu.edu.cn/hrss.

J	Li, JM; Xiao, T; Zhang, Q; Dong, M				Li, Junmin; Xiao, Tao; Zhang, Qiong; Dong, Ming			Interactive Effect of Herbivory and Competition on the Invasive Plant Mikania micrantha	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SUCCESSFUL BIOLOGICAL-CONTROL; COMPENSATORY GROWTH; NATIVE GRASS; DEFOLIATION; RESPONSES; WEED; CARBON; BUNCHGRASSES; MYCORRHIZAE; INTENSITY	A considerable number of host-specific biological control agents fail to control invasive plants in the field, and exploring the mechanism underlying this phenomenon is important and helpful for the management of invasive plants. Herbivory and competition are two of the most common biotic stressors encountered by invasive plants in their recipient communities. We predicted that the antagonistic interactive effect between herbivory and competition would weaken the effect of herbivory on invasive plants and result in the failure of herbivory to control invasive plants. To examine this prediction, thus, we conducted an experiment in which both invasive Mikania micrantha and native Coix lacryma-jobi were grown together and subjected to herbivory-mimicking defoliation. Both defoliation and competition had significantly negative effects on the growth of the invader. However, the negative effect of 75% respective defoliation on the above-and below-ground biomass of Mikania micrantha was alleviated by presence of Coix lacryma-jobi. The negative effect of competition on the above-and below-ground biomass was equally compensated at 25%, 50% and 100% defoliation and overcompensated at 75% defoliation. The interactive effect was antagonistic and dependent on the defoliation intensity, with the maximum effect at 75% defoliation. The antagonistic interaction between defoliation and competition appears to be able to release the invader from competition, thus facilitating the invasiveness of Mikania, a situation that might make herbivory fail to inhibit the growth of invasive Mikania in the invaded community.

Empirical work from behavioral, physiological and brain imaging studies suggests moral judgments are strongly modulated by disgust feelings. Yet, it remains unclear how they are related in the time course of neural processing. Examining the temporal order of disgust emotion and morality could help to clarify the role of disgust in moral judgments. In the present research, a Go/No-Go paradigm was employed to evoke lateralized readiness potentials (LRPs) to investigate the temporal order of physical disgust and moral information processing. Participants were asked to give a "yes'' or "no'' response regarding the physical disgust and moral wrongness of a social act. The results showed that the evaluation of moral information was processed prior to that of physical disgust information. This suggests that moral information is available earlier than physical disgust, and provides more data on the biological heterogeneity between disgust and morality in terms of the time course of neural activity. The findings implicate that physical disgust emotion may not be necessary for people to make moral judgments. They also suggest that some of our moral experience may be more fundamental (than physical disgust experience) to our survival and development, as humans spend a considerable amount of time engaging in social interaction.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of eta ' -> pi(+)pi(-)e(+)e(-) and eta ' -> pi(+)pi(-)mu(+)mu(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MESON; E(+)E(-); DECAYS	Based on a sample of 225.3 million J/psi events accumulated with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII, the decays of eta' -> pi(+)pi(-) l(+)l(-) are studied via J/psi -> gamma eta'. A clear eta' signal is observed in the pi(+)pi(-) e(+)e(-) mass spectrum, and the branching fraction is measured to be B(eta' -> pi(+)pi(-) e(+)e(-)) = (2.11 +/- 0.12(stat) +/- 0.14(syst)) x 10(-3), which is in good agreement with theoretical predictions and the previous measurement, but is determined with much higher precision. No eta' signal is found in the pi(+)pi(-) mu(+)mu(-) mass spectrum, and the upper limit is determined to be B(eta' -> pi(+)pi(-) mu(+)mu(-)) < 2.9 x 10(-5) at the 90% confidence level.

The obtained polystyrene-immobilized transition metal complexes generally exhibit high catalytic activity, enhanced reaction selectivity and good reusability, and thus have been attracting great attention for improving the efficiency of hydrosilylation and hydrogenation reactions in recent years. In addition, modifying polystyrene by coordinating-group-containing compounds could significantly enhance the coordination ability to metal ions. Consequently, the resultant catalysts usually provide better catalytic performance. In view of this, the current review summarizes the novel progress for the synthesis and application of polystyrene-immobilized transition metal complexes as catalysts in hydrosilylation and hydrogenation. The preparation method, catalytic performance and the related mechanism are introduced. Firstly, the amine-, phosphine-, mercapto groups-, and unsaturated hydrocarbon-modified polystyrene immobilized transition metals for catalytic hydrosilylation are described. Secondly, polystyrene immobilized transition metals (including Pt, Pd, Rh, Ru, Au nanoparticles, Cr, etc.) for catalytic hydrogenation are described, with the emphasis on the complexes of Pd and Rh. At last, the development trend of this kind of catalysts is suggested.

However, the maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the present PSCs is still much lower than that of silicon solar cell and need to be further improved for the demand of commercial production. Recent studies indicated that the incorporation of silole (silacyclopentadiene) moiety could effectively improve the crystalline and energy level (HOMO/LUMO) of the corresponding donor-acceptor conjugated polymer, thus remarkably increased the PCE of device. The present review summarizes and analyzes the progress silole-containing congjugated polymer photovoltaic donor materials in the past few years. Some issues to be addressed and hotspots to be further investigated are also presented and discussed.

Recent studies suggest aberrant functional connectivity involving specific brain regions in PNES. Little is known, however, about alterations of topological organization of whole-brain functional and structural connectivity networks in PNES. We constructed functional connectivity networks from resting-state functional MRI signal correlations and structural connectivity networks from diffusion tensor imaging tractography in 17 PNES patients and 20 healthy controls. Graph theoretical analysis was employed to compute network properties. Moreover, we investigated the relationship between functional and structural connectivity networks. We found that PNES patients exhibited altered small-worldness in both functional and structural networks and shifted towards a more regular (lattice-like) organization, which could serve as a potential imaging biomarker for PNES. In addition, many regional characteristics were altered in structural connectivity network, involving attention, sensorimotor, subcortical and default-mode networks. These regions with altered nodal characteristics likely reflect disease-specific pathophysiology in PNES. Importantly, the coupling strength of functional-structural connectivity was decreased and exhibited high sensitivity and specificity to differentiate PNES patients from healthy controls, suggesting that the decoupling strength of functional-structural connectivity might be an important characteristic reflecting the mechanisms of PNES. This is the first study to explore the altered topological organization in PNES combining functional and structural connectivity networks, providing a new way to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of PNES.

Upon collisional activation, the deprotonated molecular ions [M - H](-) dissociate in two reaction channels, both of which involve intramolecular rearrangement. The main product ion is confirmed to be an anionic acid species, [R-1-CO2](-), generated through intramolecular rearrangement of [M - H](-) initiated by the nucleophilic attack of the amide O6 on the carbonyl C2 (Path-1). The minor fragment channel (Path-2) involves methylpropene elimination of the precursor ion, followed by a similar nucleophilic displacement reaction to produce another acid anion [ R-2-CO2](-). Density functional theory calculations at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d,p) level indicate that Path-1 is more favorable than Path-2 for dissociation of the deprotonated halofenozide.

Previous in vitro studies demonstrated that Nectin like 4 (Necl-4, also known as cell adhesion molecule Cadm-4 or SynCAM-4) plays an essential role in axonal myelination by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, the role of Necl-4 protein in axonal myelination in the developing central nervous system (CNS) has remained unknown. In this study, we discovered upregulation of Necl-4 expression in mature oligodendrocytes at perinatal stages when axons undergo active myelination. We generated Necl4 gene knockout mice, but found that disruption of Necl-4 gene did not affect oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelin formation in the CNS. Surprisingly, disruption of Necl-4 had no significant effect on axonal myelination in the PNS either. Therefore, our results demonstrated that Necl-4 is dispensable for axonal myelination in the developing nervous system.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of c (3686) -> omega K(K)over-bar pi decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							FINAL-STATES	Based on 106 million c d3686_ events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII, the decay psi(3686) -> omega K (K) over bar pi is studied. Enhancements around 1.44 GeV/c(2) and the f1(1285) are observed in the mass spectrum of K (K) over bar pi, and the corresponding branching fraction ( upper limit) is measured, as well as the branching fractions of psi(3686) -> omega K*+K- + c.c. and psi(3686) -> omega(KK0)-K-*0 + c.c., all for the first time.

H.; Song, Haiyu			The alpha parallelogram predictor: A lossless compression method for motion capture data	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Character animation; Motion capture; Lossless compression; Animation compression		Motion capture data in an uncompressed form can be expensive to store, and slow to load and transmit. Current compression methods for motion capture data are primarily lossy and cause distortions in the motion data. In this paper, we present a lossless compression algorithm for motion capture data. First, we propose a novel Alpha Parallelogram Predictor (APP) to estimate the DOF (degree of freedom) of each child joint from those of its immediate neighbors and parents that have already been processed. The prediction parameter of the predictor, which is referred to as the alpha parameter, is adaptively chosen from a carefully designed lookup table. Second, we divide the predicted and actual values into three components: sign, exponent and mantissa. We then compress their corrections separately with context-based arithmetic coding. Compared with other lossless compression methods, our approach can achieve a higher compression ratio with a comparable compression time. It can be used in situations where lossy compression is not preferred. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this article, for the first time, we introduce a scaling-based algorithm (SCL) independent of recommendation list length based on a hybrid algorithm of heat conduction and mass diffusion, by finding out the scaling function for the tunable parameter and object average degree. The optimal value of the tunable parameter can be abstracted from the scaling function, which is heterogeneous for the individual object. Experimental results obtained from three real datasets, Netflix, MovieLens and RYM, show that the SCL is highly accurate in recommendation. More importantly, compared with a number of excellent algorithms, including the mass diffusion method, the original hybrid method, and even an improved version of the hybrid method, the SCL algorithm remarkably promotes the personalized recommendation in three other aspects: solving the accuracy-diversity dilemma, presenting a high novelty, and solving the key challenge of cold start problem.

J	Lv, YT; Margulies, DS; Villringer, A; Zang, YF				Lv, Yating; Margulies, Daniel S.; Villringer, Arno; Zang, Yu-Feng			Effects of Finger Tapping Frequency on Regional Homogeneity of Sensorimotor Cortex	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MOTOR CORTEX; COHERENCE; ASYMMETRY; MOVEMENT; DISEASE; BRAIN	Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) has been widely used to investigate temporally correlated fluctuations between distributed brain areas, as well as to characterize local synchronization of low frequency (<0.1 Hz) spontaneous fMRI signal. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) was proposed as a voxel-wise measure of the synchronization of the timecourses of neighboring voxels and has been used in many studies of brain disorders. However, the interpretation of ReHo remains challenging because the effect of high frequency task on ReHo is still not clear. In order to investigate the effect of a high-frequency task on the modulation of local synchronization of resting-state activity, we employed three right-finger movement scanning sessions: slow-event related ('Slow'), fast-event related ('Fast'), and continuous finger pressure ('Tonic'), from 21 healthy participants and compared the ReHo of the three task states with that of resting-state ('Rest'). In the contralateral sensorimotor cortex, 'Slow' task state showed greater ReHo than 'Rest' in low frequency band (0-0.08Hz) fMRI signal, but lower ReHo in high frequency band (0.08-1.67 Hz); 'Fast' task state showed lower ReHo than 'Rest' in both the low and high frequency band; 'Tonic' state did not show any significant difference compared to 'Rest'. The results in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex suggest that local synchronization of BOLD signal varies with different finger tapping speed. In the ipsilateral sensorimotor cortex, all the three task states had lower ReHo than the 'Rest' state both in the low and high frequency, suggesting a similar effect of fast and slow finger tapping frequencies on local synchronization of BOLD signal in the ipsilateral motor cortex.

Broadcasting quantum Fisher information	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							NO-CLONING; STATISTICAL DISTANCE; STATES; THEOREM; CANNOT	It is well known that classical information can be cloned, but nonorthogonal quantum states cannot be cloned, and noncommuting quantum states cannot be broadcast. We conceive a scenario in which the object we want to broadcast is the statistical distinguishability, as quantified by quantum Fisher information, about a signal parameter encoded in quantum states. We show that quantum Fisher information cannot be cloned, while it might be broadcast even when the input states are noncommuting. This situation interpolates between cloning of classical information and no broadcasting of quantum information, and indicates a hybrid way of information broadcasting which is of particular significance from both practical and theoretical perspectives.

Our aim is to investigate the information flow between the epileptogenic zone (EZ) and other brain regions. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data were recorded from 23 patients with left mTLE and matched controls. We first identified the potential EZ using the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) of RS-fMRI signal, then performed voxel-wise Granger causality analysis between EZ and the whole brain. Relative to controls, patients demonstrated decreased driving effect from EZ to thalamus and basal ganglia, and increased feedback. Additionally, we found an altered causal relation between EZ and cortical networks (default mode network, limbic system, visual network and executive control network). The influence from EZ to right precuneus and brainstem negatively correlated with disease duration, whereas that from the right hippocampus, fusiform cortex, and lentiform nucleus to EZ showed positive correlation. These findings demonstrate widespread brain regions showing abnormal functional interaction with EZ. In addition, increased ALFF in EZ was positively correlated with the increased driving effect on EZ in patients, but not in controls. This finding suggests that the initiation of epileptic activity depends not only on EZ itself, but also on the activity emerging in large-scale macroscopic brain networks. Overall, this study suggests that the causal topological organization is disrupted in mTLE, providing valuable information to understand the pathophysiology of this disorder.

In the present study, 1 mu g/L microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was observed to induce apoptosis in the testes of male Rana nigromaculata via the mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pathways at exposure times ranging from 7 d to 14 d. The results showed that reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content were positively correlated with exposure time. Antioxidant enzyme contents, such as reduced glutathione and glutathione peroxidase rapidly decreased, implying that the defense system of the testes induces oxidative damage. MC-LR significantly stimulated the release of cytochrome c in the testes, thereby improving the protein expressions of Bax and caspases-3, 8, and 9 (p < 0.01) and inhibiting the protein expression of Bcl-2 with prolonged exposure (p < 0.01). Ultrastructural observations showed distention of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum and deformation of the nucleolus. Moreover, prolonged exposure times strengthened and weakened the relative expression levels of C/EBP homologous protein and GRP78, respectively. These results indicate that MC-LR-induced apoptosis of the testes in male frogs in vivo may occur through the mitochondrial and ER pathways. It also further proves our previous findings that MC-LR can induce toxicity in the male reproductive system of R. nigromaculata in vitro. The findings show that MC-LR is highly hazardous to frogs and that the accepted drinking water limit of 1 mu g/L MC-LR exerts significant toxicity to amphibians. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, the chromatographic performance of core-shell column, made by fusing a 0.5 mu m porous silica layer onto 1.7 mu m nonporous silica cores, was compared with sub-2 mu m fully porous particle materials for separation and identification of phenolic compounds in canned artichoke heads. The anti-oxidant caffeoylquinic acids of artichoke extract was taken as representative for calculating the plate heights in a wide flow rate range and analyzed on the basis of the van Deemter and Knox equations. Theoretical Poppe plots were constructed for each column to compare their kinetic performance. Both phases gave similar minimum plate heights when using non-reduced coordinates. Meanwhile, the flat C-term of core-shell column provided the possibilities for applying high flow rates without significant loss in efficiency. In addition, the peak capacities of both columns were measured, at constant chromatographic linear velocity and intrinsic gradient steepness, in order to generate comparable retention window for the least and the most retained compounds. Finally, the core-shell column was successfully applied for separation and identification of 10 phenolic compounds in canned artichoke extracts by liquid chromatography-diode array detection-tandem mass spectrometry, exhibiting great potential in the field of food analysis.

This work extends in some sense the previous work by the author (Lu, 2011 [32]) for a special system of Keyfitz-Kranzer or Aw-Rascle type. As a by-product, a simple proof of the existence and stability of entropy solutions is also obtained for the hyperbolic system of isentropic gas dynamics in Eulerian coordinates under the compactness assumption of u(x)(epsilon)(x, t) or rho(epsilon)(x)(x, t) in W-loc(-1,alpha) (R x R+), alpha is an element of (1, 2), where u(epsilon) (x, t), rho(epsilon) (x, t) are viscosity velocity and density.

J	Zhang, QM; Zeng, A; Shang, MS				Zhang, Qian-Ming; Zeng, An; Shang, Ming-Sheng			Extracting the Information Backbone in Online System	PLOS ONE			English	Article								Information overload is a serious problem in modern society and many solutions such as recommender system have been proposed to filter out irrelevant information. In the literature, researchers have been mainly dedicated to improving the recommendation performance (accuracy and diversity) of the algorithms while they have overlooked the influence of topology of the online user-object bipartite networks. In this paper, we find that some information provided by the bipartite networks is not only redundant but also misleading. With such "less can be more'' feature, we design some algorithms to improve the recommendation performance by eliminating some links from the original networks. Moreover, we propose a hybrid method combining the time-aware and topology-aware link removal algorithms to extract the backbone which contains the essential information for the recommender systems. From the practical point of view, our method can improve the performance and reduce the computational time of the recommendation system, thus improving both of their effectiveness and efficiency.

The regulation of the transcriptional activity of NF-kappa B is often dependent on its interaction with I kappa B alpha. Proteins that bind to I kappa B alpha are critical regulators of NF-kappa B activity. DDRGK1 is a member of the DDRGK domain-containing protein family with unknown function. In this study, we showed that the depletion of DDRGK1 inhibits cell proliferation and invasion. Microarray analysis indicated that the expression of NF-kappa B target genes showed the most significant decrease after depleting of DDRGK1, suggesting that DDRGK1 may play an important role in the NF-kappa B signaling pathway. We further demonstrated that DDRGK1 interacts with I kappa B alpha and regulates its stability, thereby regulates the NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. Our findings identify DDRGK1 as an important regulator of the NF-kappa B pathway.

The cholesterol-lowering effects of lactic acid bacteria have recently become an area of great interest and controversy for many researchers. In this study, we investigated the effects of two NS lactobacillus strains, Lactobacillus plantarum NS5 and Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NS12, on lipid metabolism of rats fed a high cholesterol diet. Methods: Thirty-two SD rats were assigned to four groups and fed either a normal or a high-cholesterol diet. The NS lactobacillus treated groups received the high-cholesterol diet supplemented with Lactobacillus plantarum NS5 or Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus NS12 in drinking water. The rats were sacrificed after a 6-week feeding period. Body weights, visceral organ and fat weights, serum and liver cholesterol and lipid levels, intestinal microbiota and liver mRNA expression levels related to cholesterol metabolism were analyzed. Liver lipid deposition and adipocyte size were evaluated histologically. Results: Compared with rats fed a high cholesterol diet, serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein B and free fatty acids levels were decreased and apolipoprotein A-I level was increased in NS5 or NS12 strain treated rats, and with no significant change in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Liver cholesterol and triglyceride levels were also significantly decreased in NS lactobacillus strains treated groups. Meanwhile, the NS lactobacillus strains obviously alleviated hepatic injuries, decreased liver lipid deposition and reduced adipocyte size of high cholesterol diet fed rats. NS lactobacillus strains restored the changes in intestinal microbiota compositions, such as the increase in Bacteroides and the decrease in Clostridium. NS lactobacillus strains also regulated the mRNA expression levels of liver enzymes related to cholesterol metabolism, including the down regulation of acyl-CoA: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) and the upregulation of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (CYP7A1). Conclusion: This study suggested that the two NS lactobacillus strains may affect lipid metabolism and have cholesterol-lowering effects in rats fed a high cholesterol diet.

Based on relationships across different data characteristics, data characteristics of time series data are divided into two main categories: nature characteristics and pattern characteristics in this paper. Accordingly, two relevant tasks, nature determination and pattern measurement, are involved in the proposed testing scheme. In nature determination, dynamics system generating the time series data is analyzed via nonstationarity, nonlinearity and complexity tests. In pattern measurement, the characteristics of cyclicity (and seasonality), mutability (or saltation) and randomicity (or noise pattern) are measured in terms of pattern importance. For illustration purpose, four main Chinese economic time series data are used as testing targets, and the data characteristics hidden in these time series data are thoroughly explored by using the proposed integrated testing scheme. Empirical results reveal that the natures of all sample data demonstrate complexity in the phase of nature determination, and in the meantime the main pattern of each time series is captured based on the pattern importance, indicating that the proposed scheme can be used as an effective data characteristic testing tool for complex time series data exploration from a comprehensive perspective.

A changing of the abbreviated injury scale that improves accuracy and simplifies scoring	HONG KONG JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MEDICINE			English	Article						Abbreviated injury scale; changed injury severity score; injury severity score; new injury severity score; prediction of mortality	SEVERITY SCORE; MORTALITY; CARE	Objective: We present here a changing of the abbreviated injury scale (AIS). It is called the changed injury severity score (CISS), and significantly outperforms the venerable but dated the injury severity score (ISS) and the new injury severity score (NISS) as a predictor of mortality. Methods: The CISS is defined as a change of MS values by raising each AIS severity score (1-6) by a power of 4.12 divided by 30.33 and then summing the three most severe (i.e. highest AIS) regardless of body regions. CISS values were calculated for every patient in two large independent data sets: 3455, 3900 patients treated during a five-year period at the class A grade III comprehensive hospitals in Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University (Hangzhou) and Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital (Zhejiang). The power of CISS to predict morality was then compared with previously calculated NISS values of the same group patients in the two hospitals. Results: We found CISS was more accurate than NISS to predict the survival. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) of NISS and CISS in Hangzhou were 0.919 and 0.937 respectively (p=0.026), whereas for Zhejiang were 0.917 and 0.940 respectively (p=0.022). Moreover, CISS provided a better fit throughout its entire range of prediction. Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) statistic for NISS and CISS in Hangzhou were 24.00 (p=0.002) and 19.38 (p=0.007), whereas in Zhejiang were 22.70 (p=0.001) and 18.43 (p=0.005) respectively. Conclusions: CISS is a modified version of NISS/ISS with better statistical property and can be considered in trauma research.	[Wang, M.

A light Zn doping drastically suppresses the superconducting transition temperature T-c(mid) for both under-and over-doped superconductors. This is consistent with the theoretical prediction within the scenario of s +/--wave or d-wave pairings. The rate of the T-c decrease, vertical bar dT(c)/dy vertical bar, is substantially smaller in the under-doped regime than in the over-doped regime. We propose that the less drastic T-c reduction in the under-doped superconductor is due to the suppression of a competing antiferromagnetic order, which is in favor of superconductivity.

In the past two decades, MEEKC has blossomed into a powerful separation technique for the analysis of a wide range of compounds. Pseudostationary phase composition is so critical to successful resolution in EKC, and several variables could be optimized including surfactant/co-surfactant/oil type and concentration, buffer content, and pH value. Additionally, MEEKC coupled with online sample preconcentration approaches could significantly improve the detection sensitivity. This review comprehensively describes the development of MEEKC from the period 1991 to 2012. Areas covered include basic theory, microemulsion composition, improving resolution and enhancing sensitivity methods, detection techniques, and applications of MEEKC.

A critical role of thrombin/PAR-1 in ADP-induced platelet secretion and the second wave of aggregation	JOURNAL OF THROMBOSIS AND HAEMOSTASIS			English	Article						ADP; platelets; thrombin; PAR-1; PI3K	PROTEASE-ACTIVATED RECEPTORS; THROMBOXANE A(2) GENERATION; ADENOSINE-DIPHOSPHATE; PHOSPHOINOSITIDE 3-KINASE; COUPLED RECEPTORS; P2Y(12) RECEPTORS; GLYCOPROTEIN IB; INTEGRIN; CALCIUM; BLOOD	Background The stable or second wave of platelet aggregation often observed in ADP-stimulated platelet-rich plasma (PRP) with an artificially lowered extracellular calcium level has been attributed to enhanced thromboxane A2 (TXA2) generation and inhibition of ectonucleotidase activity. However, the role of thrombin in ADP-induced platelet secretion and the second wave of aggregation is unknown. Objectives and Methods We employed aggregometry, flow cytometry, immunoblotting and ELISA to determine whether and how thrombin participates in ADP-induced platelet secretion and the second wave of aggregation. Results ADP induces a phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway-dependent thrombin generation, presumably resulting from the cleavage of IIb3-associated prothrombin. Generated thrombin subsequently activates protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) and mediates dense granule secretion and the second wave of platelet aggregation in ADP-stimulated citrated PRP. Thus, ADP-induced dense granule secretion and the second wave of platelet aggregation in PRP were similarly and non-additively blocked by thrombin inhibitor hirudin, PAR-1 antagonist SCH-79797 or PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. Moreover, ADP stimulation caused the dissociation of prothrombin from IIb3 and an increased plasma thrombin level; both were prevented by wortmannin. Furthermore, the wortmannin-inhibited second wave of platelet aggregation by ADP was restored by a subaggregation concentration of PAR-1 activating peptide SFLLRN. Blocking TXA2 production with indomethacin or restoring extracellular calcium to physiological concentration did not influence this thrombin/PAR-1 dependence. Conclusions A PI3K-dependent thrombin generation and the resultant PAR-1 activation serve as an indispensable mechanism to relay the platelet activation process induced by ADP.

The mutant expressed hypersensitive response (HR)-like symptoms throughout its whole life from the first leaf to the flag leaf, without pathogen invasion. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light under natural summer field conditions. Expression of pathogenesis-related genes including PAL, PO-C1, POX22.3 and PBZ1 was enhanced significantly in association with cell death and accumulation of H2O2 at and around the site of lesions in the mutant in contrast to that in the wild-type (WT). Disease reaction to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae from the Philippines and China showed that HM47 is a broad-spectrum disease-resistant mutant with enhanced resistance to multiple races of bacterial blight pathogens tested. An F2 progeny test showed that bacterial blight resistance to race HB-17 was co-segregated with the expression of lesions. Genetic analysis indicated that the spotted-leaf trait was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named splHM47, flanked by two insertion/deletion markers in a region of approximately 74 kb on the long arm of chromosome 4. Ten open reading frames are predicted, and all of them are expressed proteins. Isolation and validation of the putative genes are currently underway.

The selection behavior originates from the special chiral reflector, which exhibits two elliptical polarization eigenstates almost identical to the same circular polarization. Theoretical analysis by using Jones matrix is given to explain this interesting phenomenon in detail. A lasing mode with an almost perfect circularly polarized field is present inside this cavity and observable at the output.

Nodularin can cause oxidative stress-induced apoptosis on fish lymphocytes. The regulatory effects of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) at 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L levels on the antioxidant defense system and apoptosis of Carassius auratus lymphocytes exposed to a high dose of nodularin (100 mu g/L) were quantified in vitro. EGCG reduced nodularin-induced oxidative damage on fish immune cells. This compound significantly increased the activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and the level of glutathione but decreased the levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde. Flow cytometry results showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells after treatment with 10,100, and 1000 mu g/L EGCG for 12 h reached 27.9%, 19.1%, and 13.7%, respectively. By contrast, the nodularin alone-induced group showed a high percentage of apoptosis (44.2%). Western blot analysis showed the increased expression of bcl-2 and the decreased expression of bax and caspase-3 in EGCG-treated fish lymphocytes. EGCG also inhibited the potential collapse of the mitochondrial membrane. Overall, EGCG can inhibit nodularin-induced apoptosis and protect the normal immunity of fish by regulating bax/bcl-2 and blocking the downstream of mitochondrial apoptosis pathway with increased intracellular antioxidant enzyme activity.

Characteristics of encapsulated L. bulgaricus, such as pH stability, bile stability, storage stability and release property, were studied in this paper. The viability of free L. bulgaricus was not observed after 1 min in simulated gastric fluids (SGF) at pH 2.5 or 2.0. Compared with that of free L. bulgaricus, the viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus only decreased 0.7 log CFU/g and 2 log CFU/g after 2.0 h incubation in SGF at pH 2.5 and pH 2.0, respectively. L. bulgaricus was also sensitive to bile solution. The viability of free L. bulgaricus was fully lost after 1 h incubation in 1 and 2% bile solution, while the viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus was only lost 2 log CFU/g and 2.6 log CFU/g in 1 and 2% bile solution at the same time, respectively. Encapsulated L. bulgaricus could be completely released from microspheres in simulated intestinal fluid (pH 6.8) within 2 h. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus retained around 8 log CFU/g when stored at 4 degrees C for 30 days. The current encapsulation technique enables a large proportion of L. bulgaricus to remain good bioactive in a simulated gastrointestinal tract environment.

The resulting slicing sites on the target transcripts could be mapped by sequencing of the 3'-cleavage remnants, called degradome sequencing. The high sequence complementarity between miRNAs and their targets has greatly facilitated the development of the target prediction tools for plant miRNAs. The prediction results were then subjected to degradome sequencing data-based validation, through which numerous miRNA-target interactions have been extracted. However, some drawbacks are unavoidable when using this forward approach. Essentially, a known list of plant miRNAs should be obtained in advance of target prediction and validation. This becomes an obstacle to discover novel miRNAs and their targets. Here, after reviewing the current available algorithms for reverse identification of miRNA-target pairs in plants, a case study was performed by using a newly established framework with adjustable parameters. In this workflow, integration of degradome and ARGONAUTE 1-enriched small RNA sequencing data was recommended to do a relatively comprehensive and reliable search. Besides, several computational algorithms such as BLAST, target plots and RNA secondary structure prediction were used. The results demonstrated the prevalent utility of the reversed approach for uncovering miRNA-target interactions in plants.

In this model, each cooperative agent and noncooperative agent are endowed with integer values of cooperative spirits and noncooperative spirits, respectively. The cooperative spirits of a cooperative agent aggregate and the noncooperative spirits of a noncooperative agent aggregate change via four competing microscopic reaction schemes: the win-win reaction between two cooperative agents, the lose-lose reaction between two noncooperative agents, the win-lose reaction between a cooperative agent and a noncooperative agent (equivalent to the migration of spirits from cooperative agents to noncooperative agents), and the cooperative agent catalyzed decline of noncooperative spirits. Based on the generalized Smoluchowski's rate equation approach, we investigate the dynamic evolution behaviors such as the total cooperative spirits of all cooperative agents and the total noncooperative spirits of all noncooperative agents. The effects of the three main groups of competition on the dynamic evolution are revealed. These include: (i) the competition between the lose-lose reaction and the win-lose reaction, which gives rise to respectively the decrease and increase in the noncooperative agent spirits; (ii) the competition between the win-win reaction and the win-lose reaction, which gives rise to respectively the increase and decrease in the cooperative agent spirits; (iii) the competition between the win-lose reaction and the catalyzed-decline reaction, which gives rise to respectively the increase and decrease in the noncooperative agent spirits.

However, so far, there has been no study to survey metal accumulation in Chinese farmland soil at the national scale. In this study, we determined 11 metals in farmland soils across the Mainland China. Our results indicated the concentrations of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu (10.1-184.2, 0.082-1.31, 20.2-321.9, 8.2-515.9 mg/kg, respectively) were elevated above their reference values. Moreover, these metals followed a similar geochemical distribution pattern. The accumulation of Pb, Cd, Zn, and Cu in soils may be associated with human activities for soil fertility. Cadmium had the highest pollution index (PI) of 5.28, and the average hazard quotients (HQs) for all the metals were below 1.

The plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase is involved in the exudation of organic acid anions. However, the relationship between organic acid exudation and PM H+-ATPase under Al toxicity remains unclear. This study aims to investigate the correlation among Al-induced citrate exudation, PM H+-ATPase activity and counterions for citrate release from cluster roots of phosphorus-deficient (-P) white lupin. Al and various pharmacological agents were applied to incubate the cluster roots of P-deficient white lupin; the citrate exudation rate, PM H+-ATPase activity and ion exudation of cluster roots were examined. Citrate exudation from cluster roots of P-deficient white lupin was induced by 50 mu M Al treatment within 1.5 h, but no extra increase was found when the duration of Al treatment increased. The PM H+-ATPase activity of cluster roots was insensitive to Al treatment, irrespective of Al concentration and duration of Al treatment. Al treatment increased K+ efflux but not H+ efflux from cluster roots. After application of pharmacological agents to P-deficient cluster roots under Al treatment or not, vanadate decreased H+ efflux and increased K+ efflux, but had no inhibitory effect on citrate exudation; fusicoccin increased H+ efflux and citrate exudation, but decreased K+ efflux; tetraethylammonium (TEA) chloride, a K+-channel inhibitor, inhibited K+ efflux and increased H+ efflux. These results indicate that citrate exudation induced by combined treatment with P-deficiency and Al is independent of PM H+-ATPase activity, and is coupled with K+ efflux, which may compensate H+ efflux for keeping the charge balance for Al-induced citrate exudation from cluster roots of P-deficient white lupin.

The main objective of this paddy field experiment was to measure the effects of organic fertilization via swine (Sus scrofa) manure on dissolved P losses by lateral seepage from organic rice production. Four swine manure organic amendment rates (0 [Ctr], 26 [Low], 39 [Middle], and 52 [High] kg P ha(-1)) were applied over the course of three rice growing seasons in 4- by 5-m plots constructed to facilitate the measurement of total dissolved phosphorus (TDP) and reactive phosphorus (DRP) via lateral seepage and surface runoff. The TDP and DRP concentrations in the lateral seepage water increased with increasing amendment rates. Lateral seepage was one of the important pathways of P losses from organic paddy fields. The seasonal averages of TDP fluxes by lateral seepage varied from 1.95 to 4.30 g P m(-1) (bund scale) and 0.39 to 0.86 g P m(-2) (plot scale) among the amendment rates (from low to high), accounting for 13.0 to 15.6% of the total P applied. In addition, floodwater level acted as the main driving force for the P lateral seepage losses from paddy fields, with a positive linear relationship (R-2 = 0.50) between floodwater level and daily lateral flow during the flooded periods (P = 0.05). Based on these results, P lateral seepage losses from organic rice production system would be minimized by shallow floodwater management and low swine manure amendment.	[Liang, X.

The main difficulty is the case of zero depth (h 0) since the nonlinear flux function P(h) is singular and the definition of solution is not clear near h = 0. First, assuming that h has a positive and lower bound, we establish the pointwise convergence of the viscosity solutions by using the div-curl lemma from the compensated compactness theory to special pairs of functions (c, f(epsilon)), and obtain a global weak entropy solution. Second, under some technical conditions on the initial data such that the Riemann invariants (w, z) are monotonic and increasing, we introduce a "variant" of the vanishing artificial viscosity to select a weak solution. Finally, we extend the results to two special cases, where P(h) is for the polytropic gas or for the Chaplygin gas. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to the SU(2) symmetry and Z(2) symmetry in this system, we obtain the analytical result of the QD and its geometric measure (GMQD), which is determined by the two-site correlators. For the 4-site and 6-site cases, the connection between GMQD (QD) and the eigenenergies was revealed. From the analytical and numerical results, we find GMQD (QD) is an effective tool in detecting both the first-order and the infinite-order quantum-phase-transition points for the finite-size systems. Moreover, by using the entanglement excitation energy and a universal frustration measure we consider the frustration properties of the system and find a nonlinear dependence of the GMQD on the frustration.

Using quantum dots (Qdots) of different sizes (Qdot-440 nm and Qdot-680 nm) as a model system, we studied the effects of polyethylene glycol (PEG) thin-layer surface modification in attenuating Qdot-related cytotoxicity, genotoxicity perturbation and oxidative stress in a cellular system. We found that uncoated Qdots (U-Qdots) made of core/shell CdSe/ZnS could indeed induce cytotoxic effects, including the inhibition of cell growth. Also, both the neutral comet assay and gamma H2AX foci formation showed that U-Qdots caused significant DNA damage in a time- and dose-dependent manner. In contrast, results from cytotoxicity analysis and gamma H2AX generation indicate minimal impact on cells after exposure to PEG-coated Qdots. This lack of observed toxic effects from PEG-coated Qdots may be due to the fact that PEG-coating can inhibit ROS generation induced by U-Qdots. Based on these observations, we conclude that the genotoxicity of Qdots could be significantly decreased following proper surface modification, such as PEG encapsulation. In addition, PEG encapsulation may also serve as a general method to attenuate nanotoxicity for other nanoparticles. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The material is semiconducting with a narrow band gap of Delta similar to 78 meV, and its temperature dependence of resistivity conforms to a three-dimensional variable range hopping mechanism. No long-range magnetic ordering was found down to 0.5 K, due to the geometric frustrations. Instead, single atomic spin-glass behavior below the spin-freezing temperature (similar to 6 K) was observed and its spin dynamics obeys the universal critical slowing down scaling law. A first-principles calculation suggested it to be a relativistic Mott insulator mediated by both electronic correlation and SOC. With moderate strength of electronic correlation and SOC, our results shed light on the research of the Heisenberg-Kitaev model in realistic materials.

However, the source of Wnt ligands and their targeting cells and action mechanism in tooth organogenesis remain largely elusive. Here we show that epithelial inactivation of Gpr177, the mouse Wntless (Wls) whose product regulates Wnt sorting and secretion, leads to arrest of tooth development at the early cap stage and abrogates tooth-forming capability of the dental epithelium. Gpr177 in the epithelium is necessary for the activation of canonical Wnt signaling in the dental epithelium and formation of a functional enamel knot. Epithelial deletion of Gpr177 results in defective gene expression and cellular behavior in the dental epithelium but does not alter odontogenic program in the mesenchyme. Furthermore, deletion of Axin2, a negative intracellular regulator of canonical Wnt signaling, rescues the tooth defects in mice carrying Gpr177 mutation in the dental epithelium. Together with the fact that active Wnt canonical signaling is present predominantly in the dental epithelium during tooth development, our results demonstrate that Gpr177-mediated Wnt ligands in the dental epithelium act primarily in an intra-epithelial context to regulate enamel knot formation and subsequent tooth development.

Fluorescent protein-expressing H. oryzae was used to monitor the colonization pattern. Hyphae invaded from the epidermis to the inner cortex, but not into the root stele. Fungal colonization increased with root tissue maturation, showing no colonization in the meristematic zone, slight colonization in the elongation zone, and heavy colonization in the differentiation zone. H. oryzae adopted a biotrophic lifestyle in roots accompanied by programmed cell death. Real-time PCR facilitated the accurate quantification of fungal growth and the respective plant response. The biocontrol potential of H. oryzae was visualized by inoculation with eGFP-tagged M. oryzae in rice. H. oryzae protected rice from M. oryzae root invasion by the accumulation of H2O2 and elevated antioxidative capacity. H. oryzae also induced systemic resistance against rice blast. This systemic resistance was mediated by the OsWRKY45-dependent salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway, as indicated by the strongly upregulated expression of OsWRKY45. The colonization pattern of H. oryzae was consistent with the typical characteristics of DSEs. H. oryzae enhanced local resistance by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and high antioxidative level and induced OsWRKY45-dependent SA-mediated systemic resistance against rice blast.

The effects of the immobilization time, temperature and the amount of enzyme were investigated, and the thermostability of immobilized lipase was also examined. The specific activity and the k(cat)/K-m of the immobilized lipase using aldehyde tag (IL-AT) were 2.50 and 3.02 fold higher, respectively, than those of the traditionally immobilized lipase using glutaraldehyde (IL-GA). The newly immobilized lipase also presented better thermo-stability than the traditionally immobilized one. The results show that the recombinant enzyme could be conveniently immobilized without glutaraldehyde and that the enzyme's active site was well protected. This is a new immobilization method able to avoid glutaraldehyde or 2,4,6-trichloro-1,3,5-triazine as an activating agent. The greener method without hazardous chemicals for the one-step purification and immobilization of an enzyme using a genetically encoded "aldehyde tag" can be exploited for numerous other enzyme purification and immobilization applications.

To understand the impacts of this feature on the evolution of cooperation, we propose a modified public goods game combined with conditional interactions in terms of the aspiration payoffs. Through simulations, we find that the function of the fraction of cooperators and the synergy factor is non-monotonic. This indicates that a large synergy factor is not always in favor of the promotion of cooperation. In addition, for a high aspiration, the typical coexistence state of cooperators and defectors could disappear, and the system demonstrates a sharp transition from the complete defection state to the complete cooperation state as the synergy factor increases. Furthermore, an interesting critical phenomenon is found in a finite system, i.e., the system can randomly evolve into a complete defection state or a complete cooperation state. An explanation of these evolutionary outcomes is provided in this paper, which is in agreement with the simulation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The resulting mixed paste could be used to prepare chitosan/cellulose/MWCNT composite membranes and fibers. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, wide-angle X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, tensile testing, and conductivity measurements were used to evaluate the structure and properties of the composite materials and the effect of the incorporation of MWCNTs at various loadings. The characterization results indicate that the incorporation of MWCNTs improved the comprehensive performances of the composite materials, and the best loading of MWCNTs was 4 wt %. This IL dissolution method is a green and feasible method for preparing chitosan/cellulose/MWCNT composite membranes and fibers and will provide beneficial references for the preparation of similar materials.

Selenium powder and phosphomolybdic acid (H3PMo12O40) are used as Se and Mo sources, respectively. The obtained products have a highly ordered hexagonal mesostructure and a rod-like particle morphology, analogous to the mother template SBA-15. The UV-vis-NIR spectrum of the material shows a strong light absorption throughout the entire visible wavelength region. The direct bandgap is estimated to be 1.37 eV. The high surface area MoSe2 mesostructure shows remarkable photocatalytic activity for the degradation of rhodamine B, a model organic dye, in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. In addition, the synthesized mesoporous MoSe2 possess a reversible lithium storage capacity of 630 mAh g1 for at least 35 cycles without any notable decrease. The rate performance of mesoporous MoSe2 is much better than that of analogously synthesized mesoporous MoS2, making it a promising anode for the lithium ion battery.

J	Cao, C; Zhang, FC				Cao, Chao; Zhang, Fuchun			Electronic structure of vacancy-ordered iron-selenide K0.5Fe1.75Se2	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY	The electronic structure of the vacancy-ordered K0.5Fe1.75Se2 iron-selenide compound (278 phase) is studied using the first-principles density functional method. The ground state of the 278 phase is stripelike antiferromagnetic, and its bare electron susceptibility shows a large peak around (pi, pi) in the folded Brillouin zone. Near the Fermi level, the density of states is dominated by the Fe-3d orbitals, and both electronlike and holelike Fermi surfaces appear in the Brillouin zone. An unfolded band structure shows limited similarities to a hole-doped 122 phase. With 0.1e electron doping, the susceptibility peak is quickly suppressed and broadened, while the two dimensionality of the electronlike Fermi surfaces is greatly enhanced, resulting in a better nesting behavior. Our study should be relevant to the recently reported superconducting phase K0.5+xFe1.75+ySe2 with both x and y being very tiny.

Methods: Two investigators independently searched the PubMed, Elsevier, EMBASE, Web of Science, Wiley Online Library and Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) for CYP2A6*4 and lung cancer were calculated in a fixed-effects model (the Mantel-Haenszel method) and a random-effects model (the DerSimonian and Laird method) when appropriate. Results: This meta-analysis included seven eligible studies, which included 2524 lung cancer cases and 2258 controls (cancer-free). Overall, CYP2A6*4 was associated with the risk of lung cancer (allele*4 vs. allele non-*4, pooled OR = 0.826, 95% CI = 0.725-0.941, P-value = 0.004). When stratifying for population, significant association was observed in Asian (additive model, pooled OR = 0.794, 95% CI = 0.694-0.909, P-value = 0.001; dominant model, pooled OR = 0.827, 95% CI = 0.709-0.965, P-value = 0.016; recessive model (pooled OR = 0.444, 95% CI = 0.293-0.675, P-value <0.0001). In the overall analysis, a comparably significant decrease in the frequency of *4/*4 genotype was detected between cases and controls in Asian while no *4/*4 genotype was detected in Caucasian in collected data. Conclusion: This meta-analysis suggests that the CYP2A6*4 polymorphism is associated with susceptibility of lung cancer in Asian. The whole gene deletion of CYP2A6 may decrease the risk of lung cancer in Asian samples.

We evaluated all characters that have previously been used to diagnose these species: indumentum of young shoots and abaxial surfaces of leaves; filament dimensions; style base; leaf color, size, and apex shape; flower number per inflorescence; corolla length; and length of the stamen and pistil. Cluster analysis of 146 individuals showed that individuals from different populations are interdigitated, irrespective of traditional taxonomic limits. Analysis of morphological data using principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) likewise shows a continual gradation between populations, rather than disjunctures between named species. Consequently, only one species is recognized in the present paper, and R. apricum, R. falcinellum (R. apricum var. falcinellum), R. florulentum, R. hepticum, R. piceum, R. rufulum, R. spadiceum, and R. rufoindumentum (nom. nud.) are all reduced to synonyms of R. taipaoense.

We focus on the interplay between the spin-exchange interaction and the effective quadratic Zeeman shift. We examine the static and the dynamic properties of both a two- and many-body system. We find that the spin-exchange interaction induces coherent Rabi oscillation in the two-body system, but the oscillation is quickly damped when the system is extended to the many-body case.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Electronic structures of zigzag silicene nanoribbons with asymmetric sp(2)-sp(3) edges	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							SPINTRONICS	The nanomaterials with peculiar spintronic characteristics, such as half-metals, spin gapless semiconductors [X. L. Wang, Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 156404 (2008)], and bipolar magnetic semiconductors [Li et al., Nanoscale 4, 5680 (2012)], play the crucial role in nano-electronics and spintronics. Here, we report the zigzag silicene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs) with asymmetric sp(2)-sp(3) edges are bipolar magnetic semiconductors due to the incorporation of Klein and zigzag edge states. With the bipolar feature, these asymmetric ZSiNRs can be altered to half-metals with opposite conductive spin channels by p-type and n-type dopings. Moreover, the semiconducting properties can also be tailored by the strain, which makes the nanoribbons into spin gapless semiconductors or ferromagnetic metals. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

J	Li, BW; Deng, LY; Zhang, H				Li, Bing-Wei; Deng, Ling-Yun; Zhang, Hong			Chiral symmetry breaking in a reaction-diffusion system	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							ROTATING SPIRAL WAVES; TURBULENCE DRIVEN; ELECTRIC-FIELD; VORTICES; ORGANIZATION; EXCITATION; TRANSITION; SELECTION; PATTERNS; VORTEX	The emergence of order in far-from-equilibrium systems is often accompanied by the formation of spatially asymmetric patterns. About 30 years ago, a general mechanism to select a chiral solution by coupling a reaction-diffusion system to an external chiral electric field was proposed by Nicolis and Prigogine [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78, 659 (1981)]. However, no experimental or even numerical evidence in reaction-diffusion systems has been reported yet. Here we report a chiral symmetry-breaking phenomenon in a reaction-diffusion system coupled to a circularly polarized electric field (CPEF). Specifically, we show that the CPEF breaks the zero-rotation chiral symmetry between clockwise and counterclockwise spiral defects and that ordered spiral waves with preferred chirality arise from defect-mediated turbulence. The occurrence of such chiral symmetry breaking can be understood by the competition between spiral defects with opposite chirality.

To examine Chinese cancer patients' fatigue self-management, including the types of self-management behaviours used, their confidence in using these behaviours, the degree of relief obtained and the factors associated with patients' use of fatigue self-management behaviours. Background. Fatigue places significant burden on patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy. While some studies have explored fatigue self-management in Western settings, very few studies have explored self-management behaviours in China. Design. Cross-sectional self- and/or interviewer-administered survey. Methods. A total of 271 participants with self-reported fatigue in the past week were recruited from a specialist cancer hospital in south-east China. Participants completed measures assessing the use of fatigue self-management behaviours, corresponding self-efficacy, perceived relief levels plus items assessing demographic characteristics, fatigue experiences, distress and social support. Results. A mean of 4.94 (+/- 2.07; range 1-10) fatigue self-management behaviours was reported. Most behaviours were rated as providing moderate relief and were implemented with moderate self-efficacy. Regression analyses identified that having more support from one's neighbourhood and better functional status predicted the use of a greater number of self-management behaviours. Separate regression analyses identified that greater neighbourhood support predicted greater relief from 'activity enhancement behaviours' and that better functional status predicted greater relief from 'rest and sleep behaviours'. Higher self-efficacy scores predicted greater relief from corresponding behaviours. Conclusions. A range of fatigue self-management behaviours were initiated by Chinese patients with cancer. Individual, condition and environmental factors were found to influence engagement in and relief from fatigue self-management behaviours. Relevance to clinical practice. Findings highlight the need for nurses to explore patients' use of fatigue self-management behaviours and the effectiveness of these behaviours in reducing fatigue. Interventions that improve patients' self-efficacy and neighbourhood supports have the potential to improve outcomes from fatigue self-management behaviours.

Two sharply different types of patterns, wavelet turbulence (WT) patterns and synchronous firing (SF) patterns, and the associated transitions and hysteresis are found in wide parameter regions and in different excitable models. The WT state is maintained by wavelet defects while the SF state is due to iterative excitations between majority nodes and minority nodes where defects do not play essential roles. Moreover, a dominant phase-advanced driving method is applied to explain how self-sustained SFs can be maintained in ESWN and why SF and WT states show distinctive characteristic features. Since excitability of node and small-world network structure are two essential ingredients of some neural subsystems and SFs are important for many neural functions, the results in this paper are thus expected to be instructive for understanding the dynamics of some neural networks.

Canonized by the joint efforts of literary imitation, criticism, cultural market and education institutions, the novel has grown into some handy tool for anyone to radical skepticism and self assertion. Nevertheless, the spirit of "self-doubt" that the original novel contains is lost in the process, and a precious element of truth growth has yet to be introduced into the Chinese culture.

Here, we examined the effect of early exposure to reading on neural responses to both word and face processing in preschool children with the use of the Event Related Potential (ERP) methodology. We specifically linked children's reading experience (indexed by their sight vocabulary) to two major neural markers: the amplitude differences between the left and right N170 on the bilateral posterior scalp sites and the hemispheric spectrum power differences in the gamma band on the same scalp sites. The results showed that the left-lateralization of both the word N170 and the spectrum power in the gamma band were significantly positively related to vocabulary. In contrast, vocabulary and the word left-lateralization both had a strong negative direct effect on the face right-lateralization. Also, vocabulary negatively correlated with the right-lateralized face spectrum power in the gamma band even after the effects of age and the word spectrum power were partialled out. The present study provides direct evidence regarding the role of reading experience in the neural specialization of word and face processing above and beyond the effect of maturation. The present findings taken together suggest that the neural development of visual word processing competes with that of face processing before the process of neural specialization has been consolidated.

Signals in various impulsive noise models are considered to illustrate that the robust S transform can achieve better performance than the standard S transform. Moreover, mean square errors for instantaneous frequency estimation of the robust S transform are compared with that of the standard S transform, showing that the robust S transform can achieve significantly improved instantaneous frequency estimation for the signals in impulsive noise.

J	Cao, J; Srivastava, HM				Cao, Jian; Srivastava, H. M.			Some q-generating functions of the Carlitz and Srivastava-Agarwal types associated with the generalized Hahn polynomials and the generalized Rogers-Szego polynomials	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND COMPUTATION			English	Article						Hahn and generalized Hahn polynomials; Carlitz's generating functions; Carlitz's q-operators; q-Exponential decomposition technique; Rogers-Szego and generalized Rogers-Szego polynomials; Carlitz type generating functions; Srivastava-Agarwal type generating functions		Motivated essentially by the fact that generating functions play an important role in the investigation of many potentially useful properties of the sequences which they generate, various families of q-generating functions of the Carlitz and Srivastava-Agarwal types have been investigated in the literature for the continuous q-Hermite polynomials, the Hahn polynomials, the Rogers-Szego polynomials, and indeed also for many other q-polynomial systems. The main object of this paper is to apply a certain q-exponential decomposition technique with a view to deriving several bilinear and trilinear q-generating functions associated with the generalized Hahn polynomials. As a simple consequence of one of the main results derived in this paper, we are led naturally to the corrected version of a bilinear q-generating function which appeared in one of Carlitz's papers.

J	Xue, SW; Weng, XC; He, S; Li, DW				Xue ShaoWei; Weng XuChu; He Sheng; Li DianWen			Similarity representation of pattern-information fMRI	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Review						representational similarity analysis; pattern information; condition-rich experiments; decode	HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVITY; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; NATURAL IMAGES; OBJECTS; SPEECH; MEMORY; MONKEY; STATES; SPACE	Representational similarity analysis (RSA) is a rapidly developing multivariate platform to investigate the structure of neural activities. Similarity/dissimilarity is the core concept of RSA, realized by the construction of a representational dissimilarity matrix, that addresses the closeness/distance for each pair of research elements (e.g., one minus the correlation between the brain responses to 2 different stimuli) and in turn, constitutes a multivariate pattern as its analytic foundation. This approach is also welcome for its sensitivity in detecting subtle differences of distributed experimental effects in the brain. Importantly, RSA is not only an experimental tool but a promising data-analytical framework that can integrate cross-modal imaging signals, explore brain-behavior link, and verify computational models according to measured neural activities. RSA substantiates its integrative power by relating similarity structure in one domain (e.g., stimulus features) to that in another domain (e.g., neural activities). This review summarizes dissimilarity/similarity definition of RSA, introduces how to derive the dissimilarity structure in neural response pattern, and carry out connectivity analysis based on RSA platform. Several recent advances are highlighted, such as the extraction of across-subjects regularity, cross-validation of brain reactivity in human beings and monkeys, the incorporation of computational models and behavioral profiles into RSA. Voxel receptor field modeling, another promising multivariate tool of pattern elucidation, is presented and compared. The application of RSA is expected to surge and extend in many fields of neuroscience, computation, psychology and medicine. We also discuss the limitations of RSA and some critical questions that need to be addressed in future research.

We compared two species (Abies fabri and Rhododendron calophytum) for their growth pattern and base elements concentration in both polluted (Mt. Emei) and unpolluted (Mt. Gongga) sites in Sichuan, southwestern China. A. fabri grown at Mt. Emei had poorer crown condition, slower radial growth rate, and lower seedling density under long-term acid deposition, which correlated closely with the reduced Ca concentration in foliage and tree-ring, in comparison with those at Mt. Gongga. In contrast, R. calophytum showed a stable Ca level and thus displayed normal growth between the two sites. The differential capability of these two species to acclimate to poor Ca environment is one of the keys to understanding the long-term ecological effect of changing atmospheric acid and Ca deposition in the subalpine forest in southwestern China.

J	Hou, HS; Sun, H; Zhou, YJ				Hou Hong-Sheng; Sun Hao; Zhou Ya-Jin			Flavor Changing Top Quark Decay and Bottom-Strange Production in the Littlest Higgs Model with T-parity	COMMUNICATIONS IN THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article						LHT; FCNC	FCNC; BOSON	Flavor changing effects on the processes t -> ch, e(+)e(-) -> b (s) over bar, e(+)e(-) -> b (s) over barh and pp -> b (s) over bar in the LHT model are investigated in this paper. We calculate the one-loop level contributions from the T-parity odd mirror fermions and gauge bosons. The results show that the top quark rare decay t -> ch in the LHT model can be significantly enhanced relative to that in the SM. The b (s) over bar production at linear colliders in the LHT model can enhance the SM cross section a lot and reach 0.1 fb in some parameter space allowed in the experiment. But the heavy gauge boson and mirror fermion loops have small contribution to the processes pp -> b (s) over bar and e(+)e(-) -> b (s) over barh. So the LHT effect on e(+)e(-) -> b (s) over bar might be detected at future linear colliders, while it is too small to be seen for the e(+)e(-) -> b (s) over barh, and pp -> b (s) over bar processes at future linear colliders and LHC.

Upon collisional activation, the protonated molecules undergo fragmentation reactions via three primary channels: (1) direct decomposition to the benzyl cation (m/z 91), (2) formation of an ion-neutral complex of [benzyl cation+proline]+, followed by a hydride transfer to generate the protonated 4,5-dihydro-3H-pyrrole-2-carboxylic acid (m/z 114), and (3) electrophilic attack at the amino by the transferring benzyl cation, and the subsequent migration of the activated amino proton leading to the simultaneous loss of (H2O+CO). Interestingly, no hydrogen/deuterium exchange for the fragment ion m/z 114 occurs in the d-labeling experiments, indicating that the transferring hydride in path-b comes from the methenyl hydrogen rather than the amino hydrogen. For para-substituted benzyl esters, the presence of electron-donating substituents significantly promotes the direct decomposition (path-a), whereas the presence of electron-withdrawing ones distinctively inhibits that channel. For the competing channels of path-b and path-c, the presence of electron-donating substituents favors path-b rather than path-c, whereas the presence of electron-withdrawing ones favors path-c rather than path-b.

Authentication, security, patient's privacy protection and data confidentiality are important for patient or doctor accessing to Electronic Medical Records (EMR). In 2012, Chen et al. showed that Khan et al.'s dynamic ID-based authentication scheme has some weaknesses and proposed an improved scheme, and they claimed that their scheme is more suitable for TMIS. However, we show that Chen et al.'s scheme also has some weaknesses. In particular, Chen et al.'s scheme does not provide user's privacy protection and perfect forward secrecy, is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack and impersonation attack once user's smart card is compromised. Further, we propose a secure anonymity authentication scheme to overcome their weaknesses even an adversary can know all information stored in smart card.

In order to obtain accurate classification results, we took advantages of both traditional hard classification methods (HCM) and soft classification models (SCM), and developed a new method called the hard and soft classification model (HSCM) based on adaptive threshold calculation. The authors tested the new method in land cover mapping applications. According to the results of confusion matrix, the overall accuracy of HCM, SCM, and HSCM is 71. 06%, 67. 86%, and 71. 10%, respectively. And the kappa coefficient is 60. 03%, 56. 12%, and 60. 07%, respectively. Therefore, the HSCM is better than HCM and SCM. Experimental results proved that the new method can obviously improve the land cover and land use classification accuracy.

The system aims to help users find relevant items from a potentially overwhelming set of choices. However, most of the existing recommender algorithms focused on the traditional user-item similarity computation, other than incorporating the social interests into the recommender systems. As we know, each user has their own preference field, they may influence their friends' preference in their expert field when considering the social interest on their friends' item collecting. In order to model this social interest, in this paper, we proposed a simple method to compute users' social interest on the specific items in the recommender systems, and then integrate this social interest with similarity preference. The experimental results on two real-world datasets Epinions and Friendfeed show that this method can significantly improve not only the algorithmic precision-accuracy but also the diversity-accuracy.

As opposed to biologically inspired models, some techniques as Granger causality (GC) are purely data-driven and rely on statistical prediction and temporal precedence. While powerful and widely applicable, this approach could suffer from two main limitations when applied to BOLD fMRI data: confounding effect of hemodynamic response function (HRF) and conditioning to a large number of variables in presence of short time series. For task-related fMRI, neural population dynamics can be captured by modeling signal dynamics with explicit exogenous inputs; for resting-state fMRI on the other hand, the absence of explicit inputs makes this task more difficult, unless relying on some specific prior physiological hypothesis. In order to overcome these issues and to allow a more general approach, here we present a simple and novel blind-deconvolution technique for BOLD-fMRI signal. In a recent study it has been proposed that relevant information in resting-state fMRI can be obtained by inspecting the discrete events resulting in relatively large amplitude BOLD signal peaks. Following this idea, we consider resting fMRI as 'spontaneous event-related', we individuate point processes corresponding to signal fluctuations with a given signature, extract a region-specific HRF and use it in deconvolution, after following an alignment procedure. Coming to the second limitation, a fully multivariate conditioning with short and noisy data leads to computational problems due to overfitting. Furthermore, conceptual issues arise in presence of redundancy. We thus apply partial conditioning to a limited subset of variables in the framework of information theory, as recently proposed. Mixing these two improvements we compare the differences between BOLD and deconvolved BOLD level effective networks and draw some conclusions. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Many studies have found higher fractional anisotropy (FA) in the left anterior cingulum bundle (aCB) than in the right. However, the asymmetry of gray matter density (GMD) is not clear. Using multiple modalities of MRI, we investigated both FA and GMD in the dACC in two independent groups of healthy participants (50 per group, 18-24 years old, half males and half females). Consistent with previous findings, the mean FA of the left aCB was significantly higher than that of the right. Males showed higher FA in the bilateral aCB than females. Voxel-based analysis of GMD in the dACC presented a region-specific significant asymmetry: right > left in the lower part (around callosal sulcus) but left > right in the upper part (around cingulate sulcus). No significant sex effect was found for GMD in the dACC. All these results were almost the same across the two independent groups. The complex pattern of asymmetry in GMD may imply highly differentiated functions of the dACC. Future fine-scale structural and diffusion MRI studies and a battery of cognitive behavioral measurements are needed to fully elucidate the asymmetry of the dACC.

The influent substrate ratio of nitrite-to-ammonium (R-IS) was shown to be a key factor in the Anammox process, and the optimal R-IS level was 1.2. When the influent ammonium or nitrite level was relatively high, residual substrate over-consumption was observed. The free ammonia was not significantly inhibitory to the Anammox biomass at a concentration of 17 +/- 2 mg N L-1; however, a high level of residual nitrite reduced the activity of Anammox bacteria. The activity that was depressed by nitrite inhibition was revived within 5 days following the reduction of the R-IS. In this study, the Haldane, Edwards and Aiba models, which were used to simulate nitrite inhibition of the Anammox process, were workable, and the parameters for these models were determined.

However, there is little information regarding the role of AQPs in the human fallopian tube, specifically their role in human tubal ectopic pregnancy. In this study we took tissue samples from the site of implantation of tubal ectopic pregnancy (group 1, N = 30, mean age 32 years, range 23-42) and the corresponding non-implantation site in women undergoing salpingectomy for tubal pregnancy (group 2). Ampullary fallopian tubes during mid-secretory phase were collected as control group (group 3, N = 17, mean age 37 years, range 30-50). Thin sections were prepared and stained with anti-AQP9, and, for estrogen and progesterone receptors in each group. Immunohistochemical studies showed that AQP9 proteins localize in the cytoplasm of epithelial cells of Fallopian tube. Expression of AQP9 was significantly reduced during tubal pregnancy compared to controls (group 1 vs. group 3, P = 0.036; group 2 vs. group 3, P = 0.029), and, this reduced expression was not related to estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status (group 2, ER vs. AQP9, Pearson r = 0.173, P = 0.361; PR vs. AQP9, Pearson r = 0.124, P = 0.514, respectively). Similarly, there is no correlation between AQP9 and estrogen receptor or progesterone receptor status in the normal group (group 3, ER vs. AQP9, Pearson r = -0.026, P = 0.923; PR vs. AQP9, Pearson r = -0.292, P = 0.255, respectively). Reduced expression of AQP9 in human fallopian tube may contribute to aspects of pathophysiology of tubal ectopic pregnancy.

Proper formation of myelin sheaths around axons depends on the timely differentiation of oligodendrocytes. This differentiation occurs on a predictable schedule both in culture and during development. However, the timing mechanisms for oligodendrocyte differentiation during normal development have not been fully uncovered. Recent studies have identified a large number of regulatory factors, including cell-intrinsic factors and extracellular signals, that could control the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation. Here we provide a mechanistic and critical review of the timing control of oligodendrocyte differentiation.

In the past, when biological technologies were applied to treat livestock wastewater, the removal efficiency of estrogen pollutants was always ignored. Therefore, the efficiency of estrogen removal by anaerobic/aerobic (A/O) treatment and by up flow anaerobic sludge blanket and step-fed sequencing batch reactor (UASB-SFSBR) treatment was investigated in the present study. The results showed that the A/O treatment had no significant estrogenic removal ability, whereas the removal rates of estrogen after UASB-SFSBR treatment reached approximately 78 %, as measured by liquid chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry. The estrogen concentration decreased from 31.5 ng/L to an undetectable level according to the yeast estrogen screen analysis. We found differences between the estrogen removal rates measured by the chemical assay and those measured using the bioassay. More attention must be paid to the removal of estrogen pollutants in livestock wastewater to reduce the environmental risk.

However, few studies have addressed the effective model for monitoring nitrogen status at canopy level using Support Vector Machines (SVM). The present study is focused on the assessment of an estimation model for nitrogen concentration of rape canopy with hyperspectral data. Two types of estimation model, the traditional statistical method based on stepwise linear regression (SLR) and the emerging computationally powerful techniques based on support vector machines were applied The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and T values were used to assess their predictability. The results show that a better agreement between the observed and the predicted nitrogen concentration were obtained by using the SVM model. Compared to the SLR model, the SVM model improved the results by lowering RMSE by 11.86-21.13 %, and by increasing T by 20.00-29.41 % for different spectral transformations. The study demonstrated the potential of SVM to estimate nitrogen concentration using canopy level hyperspectral data and it was concluded that SVM may provide a useful exploratory and predictive tool when applied to canopy-level hyperspectral reflectance data for monitoring nitrogen status of rape.

The formulation of this new model is different from the original PSVM model, so a novel iterative algorithm is proposed to solve this model. A simulation test is first implemented on a classic two-spiral dataset, and then an empirical experiment is conducted on two publicly available credit datasets.

This study further characterized the regulation of VuMATE1, an aluminium-activated citrate transporter. Al stress induced VuMATE1 expression, followed by the secretion of citrate. Citrate secretion was specific to Al stress, whereas VuMATE1 expression was not, which could be explained by a combined regulation of VuMATE1 expression and Al-specific activation of VuMATE1 protein. Pre-treatment with a protein translation inhibitor suppressed VuMATE1 expression, indicating that de novo biosynthesis of proteins is required for gene expression. Furthermore, post-treatment with a protein translation inhibitor inhibited citrate secretion, indicating that post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 is critical for citrate secretion. Protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitor studies showed that reversible phosphorylation was important not only for transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1 expression but also for post-translational regulation of VuMATE1 protein activity. These results suggest that citrate secretion is dependent on both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of VuMATE1. Additionally, VuMATE1 promoter-glucuronidase fusion lines revealed that VuMATE1 expression was restricted to the root apex and was entirely Al induced, indicating the presence of cis-acting elements regulating root tip-specific and Al-inducible gene expression, which will be an important resource for genetic improvement of plant Al resistance.

Both conducting properties and surface morphology of PEDOT:PSS film can be systematically tunable by simply controlling addition of an ionic liquid, 1,3-dihydroxy-2-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)-imide (DHIL). The electrical conductivity increases from 0.07 for pristine PEDOT:PSS to 55 S cm(-1) after addition of 2 wt% DHIL, with no necessary of any further heat treatment, which is around 800 times increase in the electrical conductivity. On the other hand, the discrete compact PEDOT:PSS film is gradually transformed into the nanoporous film with addition of DHIL. It is considered that such size-tunable porous PEDOT:PSS films with high surface area as well as high conductivity combining solution-processibility show great potential in applications that require high interfacial area, such as flexible electronic components, next-generation catalytic, and separation supports.

Previous studies in Arabidopsis thaliana indicated that the degradation of transitory starch only occurs in the chloroplasts. Here, we report that autophagy, a nonplastidial process, participates in leaf starch degradation. Excessive starch accumulation was observed in Nicotiana benthamiana seedlings treated with an autophagy inhibitor and in autophagy-related (ATG) gene-silenced N. benthamiana and in Arabidopsis atg mutants. Autophagic activity in the leaves responded to the dynamic starch contents during the night. Microscopy showed that a type of small starch granule-like structure (SSGL) was localized outside the chloroplast and was sequestered by autophagic bodies. Moreover, an increased number of SSGLs was observed during starch depletion, and disruption of autophagy reduced the number of vacuole-localized SSGLs. These data suggest that autophagy contributes to transitory starch degradation by sequestering SSGLs to the vacuole for their subsequent breakdown.

The effects of the reaction parameters (volume ratio of distilled water to ethanol, reaction time and reaction temperature) on the morphology and size of the CoS structures were investigated. The synthesized product was characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It has been confirmed that the volume ratio of distilled water to ethanol played a key role in the formation of the ball in cage structures, and the formation mechanism of the CoS ball in cage structures was also proposed. The electrochemical capacitance performances of the CoS products were studied, and the CoS ball in cage structures show excellent energy storage characteristics.

VCP has been demonstrated playing a critical role in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) pathogenesis and progression recently. We investigated the association between VCP polymorphisms and clinical outcome in advanced NSCLC patients undergoing platinum-based chemotherapy. We recruited 663 Chinese advanced NSCLC patients who were treated with platinum-based regimens, and using their clinical data, we assessed the efficacy and side effects of their treatment. Three tag-single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of VCP were genotyped. SNP rs2074549 showed a significant association with severe neutropenia. Its G/G genotype increased the risk of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with wild-type homozygotes A/A (P = .001, odds ratio = 2.975). Haplotype association analysis revealed that CGA was associated with the increased incidence of severe neutropenia (P = .041, odds ratio = 1.439). However, no significant relationship was found between the presence of VCP polymorphisms and treatment efficacy when objective response, progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Our study is the first to provide evidence that VCP polymorphisms are associated with a severe chemotherapy-related adverse outcome in platinum-treated advanced NSCLC patients.	[Peng, J.; Zhao, X.

Lu [Y.-G. Lu, Global existence of solutions to resonant system of isentropic gas dynamics, Nonlinear Anal. RWA 12 (2011) 2802-28101, the maximum principle was used to study the uniformly bounded L-infinity estimates z(rho(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) <= B(x), w(rho(delta,epsilon) , u(delta,epsilon)) <= M(t) for the epsilon-viscosity and delta-flux-approximation solutions (rho(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) of the nonhomogeneous system (1.3), where w, z are Riemann invariants of (1.3) and M(t) depends on the bound of the nonlinear function a(x), which excludes the class of discontinuous functions. In this short paper, we obtain the estimate w(rho(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) <= beta when a'(x) >= 0 for a suitable constant beta depending only on the bound of a(x) and prove the existence of bounded entropy solutions, for the Cauchy problem of the isentropic Euler equations with geometric effects (1.1), which extend the results of the finite energy solution in LeFloch and Westdickenberg [P.

Different from typical porous metal oxides, the prepared high-surface-area nonwoven fabrics show excellent mechanical properties. Not only are these fabrics self-supporting over a large area, but they can also be cut using scissors, which is important for large-scale applications. Furthermore, as electrode materials in Li-ion batteries, these fabrics exhibit much higher charge/discharge capacity and cycle stability compared with the commercially available nanosized TiO2 (P25). The improved mechanical and electrochemical performances are attributed to the presence of an outer-shell, inner-bicontinuous structures (including continuous TiO2 frame and continuous nanopores) and hierarchical pores from the cigarlike nanofibers.

Coordinating the activation states of the backward-driving A and forward-driving B class motor neurons is critical for generating sinusoidal and directional locomotion. Here, we show by in vivo calcium imaging that expression of a hyperactive, somatodendritic ionotropic acetylcholine receptor ACR-2(gf) in A and B class motor neurons induces aberrant synchronous activity in both ventral-and dorsal-innervating B and A class motor neurons. Expression of ACR-2(gf) in either ventral-or dorsal-innervating B neurons is sufficient for triggering the aberrant synchrony that results in arrhythmic convulsions. Silencing of AVB, the premotor interneurons that innervate B motor neurons suppresses ACR-2(gf)-dependent convulsion; activating AVB by channelrhodopsin induces the onset of convulsion. These results support that the activity state of B motor neurons plays an instructive role for the coordination of motor circuit.

The molecular mechanisms leading to colored fiber development are still largely unknown, although it is expected that the color is derived from flavanoids. Experimental Design: Firstly, four key genes of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in cotton (GhC4H, GhCHS, GhF3'H, and GhF3'5'H) were cloned and studied their expression profiles during the development of brown-and white cotton fibers by QRT-PCR. And then, the concentrations of four components of the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway, naringenin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin in brown-and white fibers were analyzed at different developmental stages by HPLC. Result: The predicted proteins of the four flavonoid structural genes corresponding to these genes exhibit strong sequence similarity to their counterparts in various plant species. Transcript levels for all four genes were considerably higher in developing brown fibers than in white fibers from a near isogenic line (NIL). The contents of four flavonoids (naringenin, quercetin, kaempferol and myricetin) were significantly higher in brown than in white fibers and corresponding to the biosynthetic gene expression levels. Conclusions: Flavonoid structural gene expression and flavonoid metabolism are important in the development of pigmentation in brown cotton fibers.

We here studied auditory localisation using the patient's own name as compared to a meaningless sound (i.e., ringing bell). Methods: Eighty-six post-comatose patients diagnosed with a vegetative state/unresponsive wakefulness syndrome or a minimally conscious state were prospectively included. Localisation of auditory stimulation (i.e., head or eyes orientation toward the sound) was assessed using the patient's own name as compared to a ringing bell. Statistical analyses used binomial testing with bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. Results: 37 (43%) out of the 86 studied patients showed localisation to auditory stimulation. More patients (n=34, 40%) oriented the head or eyes to their own name as compared to sound (n=20, 23%; p<0.001). Conclusions: When assessing auditory function in disorders of consciousness, using the patient's own name is here shown to be more suitable to elicit a response as compared to neutral sound.

However, the toxicity of CSO-SA is not clear. In the present study, the genotoxic effects of CSO-SA nanomicelles (with high substitution degree of SA, 42.6 +/- 3.8%) were evaluated with a battery of genotoxicity assays. Mutagenicity was not found in Ames Salmonella/microsome mutagenicity assay (Ames test), while mild but definite positive results were observed in mouse bone marrow micronucleus assay and single cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE or comet assay) in A549 cells. CSO-SA was also found to induce apoptosis and oxidative stress through the induction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in a dose-dependent manner in A549 cells. Preincubation with the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-l-cysteine (NAC) decreased the intracellular ROS level and alleviated the DNA damage in A549 cells. Expression levels of cleaved poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), caspase-9 and caspase-3, markers of apoptosis, were significantly higher in CSO-SA treated cells. In conclusion, these results suggested significant genotoxicity of high doses of CSO-SA nanomicelles in vivo and in vitro. Oxidative stress was, at least partially, the possible mechanism underlying the genotoxicity induced by CSO-SA. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, JH; Ma, K; Li, K				Wang, Jian-hua; Ma, Kai; Li, Kang			Influences of a topological defect on the spin Hall effect	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							GRAVITATIONAL-FIELD; COSMIC STRINGS; LANDAU-LEVELS; ELECTRONS	We study the influence of topological defects on the spin current as well as the spin Hall effect. We find that the nontrivial deformation of the space time due to topological defects can generate a spin-dependent current which then induces an imbalanced accumulation of spin states on the edges of the sample. The corresponding spin Hall conductivity has also been calculated for the topological defect of a cosmic string. Compared to the ordinary value, a correction which is linear with mass density of the cosmic string appears. Our approach to the dynamics of nonrelativistic spinors in the presence of a topological defect is based on the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. The spin current is obtained by using the extended Drude model, which is independent of the scattering mechanism.

The parent compound BaTi2Sb2O is confirmed to exhibit superconductivity at 1.5 K as well as charge-or spin-density wave (CDW/SDW) ordering below 55 K. With the partial substitution of Sb by Bi, the lattice parameters a, c, and c/a all increase monotonically, indicating a negative chemical pressure and lattice distortion for the (super) conducting Ti2Sb2O layers. Bi doping elevates the superconducting transition temperature to its maximum T-c = 3.7 K at x = 0.17, and then T-c decreases gradually with further Bi doping. A metal-to-nonmetal transition takes place around x = 0.3, and superconductivity at similar to 1 K survives on the nonmetal side. The CDW/SDW anomaly, in comparison, is rapidly suppressed by Bi doping, and vanishes for x >= 0.17. The results are discussed in terms of negative chemical pressure and the disorder effect.

Comparing face processing strategies between typically-developed observers and observers with autism using sub-sampled-pixels presentation in response classification technique	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Response classification; Face discrimination; Autism; Strategy	FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; RECOGNITION; CHILDREN; PERCEPTION; FEATURES; EYE; INFORMATION; EMOTIONS; BUBBLES	In the present study we modified the standard classification image method by subsampling visual stimuli to provide us with a technique capable of examining an individual's face-processing strategy in detail with fewer trials. Experiment 1 confirmed that one testing session (1450 trials) was sufficient to produce classification images that were qualitatively similar to those obtained previously with 10,000 trials (Sekuler et al., 2004). Experiment 2 used this method to compare classification images obtained from observers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and typically-developing (TD) observers. As was found in Experiment 1, classification images obtained from TD observers suggested that they all discriminated faces based on information conveyed by pixels in the eyes/brow region. In contrast, classification images obtained from ASD observers suggested that they used different perceptual strategies: three out of five ASD observers used a typical strategy of making use of information in the eye/brow region, but two used an atypical strategy that relied on information in the forehead region. The advantage of using the response classification technique is that there is no restriction to specific theoretical perspectives or a priori hypotheses, which enabled us to see unexpected strategies, like ASD's forehead strategy, and thus showed this technique is particularly useful in the examination of special populations.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurements of the branching fractions for J/psi and psi ' -> Lambda(Lambda)over-bar pi(0) and Lambda(Lambda)over-bar eta	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DECAYS	We report on a study of the isospin-violating and isospin-conserving decays of the J/psi and psi' charmonium state to Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(0) and Lambda(Lambda) over bar eta, respectively. The data are based on 225 million J/psi and 106 million psi' events that were collected with the BESIII detector. The most accurate measurement of the branching fraction of the isospin-violating process J/psi -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(0) is obtained, and the isospin-conserving processes J/psi -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar eta and psi' -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar eta are observed for the first time. The branching fractions are measured to be B(J/psi -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(0)) = (3.78 +/- 0.27(stat) +/- 0.30(sys)) x 10(-5), B(J/psi -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar eta) = (15.7 +/- 0.80(stat) +/- 1.54(sys)) x 10(-5) and B(psi' -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar eta) = (2.48 +/- 0.34(stat) +/- 0.19(sys)) x 10(-5). No significant signal events are observed for psi' -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(0) decay resulting in an upper limit of the branching fraction of B(psi' -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(0)) < 0.29 x 10(-5) at the 90% confidence level. The two-body decay of J/psi -> Sigma(1385)(0)<(Lambda)over bar> + c.c. is searched for, and the upper limit is B(J/psi -> Sigma(1385)(0)(Lambda) over bar + c.c.) < 0.82 x 10(-5) at the 90% confidence level.

The UV spectra showed that there was no distinctive intramolecular interaction for the EDOTTTF monomer between the EDOT and the TTF moieties in the ground state; however, the cyclic voltammetry responses implied that such intramolecular interaction occurred. Electropolymerization in excessive potential could bring in strong overoxidation effects and degradation in the polymer film. The polymers were simulated using density functional theory with Gaussian03 package and the optimized HOMO and LUMO state were figured out. The conductivity of TTF-polymer was 6 S.cm-1 obtained by galvano station and 4.8 x 10-3 S.cm-1 obtained by potentiostatic electropolymerization after doping with 7,7,8,8-tetracyanoquinodimethane. The results indicated that this polymer was a reasonable candidate for conducting materials and it was meaningful to increase the conductive dimensions of TTF polymers by chemical doping.

BESIII Collaboration	Evidence for eta(c)(2S) in psi(3686) -> gamma(KSK +/-)-K-0 pi(-/+)pi(+)pi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We search for the M1 radiative transition psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S) by reconstructing the exclusive eta(c)(2S) -> (KSK +/-)-K-0 pi(-/+)pi(+)pi(-) decay using 1.06 X 10(8) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector. The signal is observed with a statistical significance of greater than 4 standard deviations. The measured mass of the eta(c)(2S) is 3646.9 +/- 1.6(stat) +/- 3.6(syst) MeV/c(2), and the width is 9.9 +/- 4.8(stat) +/- 2.9(syst) MeV/c(2). The product branching fraction is measured to be B(psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S)) X B(eta(c)(2S) -> gamma(KSK +/-)-K-0 pi(-/+)pi(+)pi(-) = (7.03 +/- 2.10(stat) +/- 0.70(syst)) X 10(-6). This measurement complements a previous BESIII measurement of psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S) with eta(c)(2S) -> (KSK +/-)-K-0 pi(-/+) and K+K-pi(0).	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J.

The sample plug loaded into the sampling channel in the microchip was driven into ICP-MS as soon as the multi-functional valve was changed from the load position to the inject position. The sample plug depends on the sampling channel. 40-200 nL sample was introduced into ICP-MS with the sampling channel length of 5-25 mm. The proposed microchip-based nanoflow injection system offers many advantages including low sample consumption, satisfactory precisions (less than 3.0%), low sampling dead volume (nearly zero) and easy fabrication. With 200 nL sampling volume and a flow rate of 20 mu L/min for the carrier, a peak profile with the highest peak height within the shortest time was obtained. The absolute detection limit of the chip-based nanoflow injection system for Pt-195 was 2.54 fg under optimized conditions, which was improved by a factor of 3244 in comparison with the conventional sampling system. A sample throughput of 48 h(-1) was obtained with the nanoflow injection system. Relative standard deviations of peak heights of 10 replicate trials of 10 mu g/L standard solution and the human plasma sample S1 were 1.5% and 2.7%, respectively. Contents of platinum in six human plasma samples by the proposed method agreed well with those by the conventional sampling system, and the recoveries of six plasma samples ranged between 94.3% and 103.0%. These results indicate the accuracy of the present method.

However, as a potential bioenergy plant, it has obvious advantages. Therefore, it is academically important to study its spatial distribution and bioenergy potentials. The present research, using the remote sensing data from China and Brazil earth resources satellite (CBERS), coupled with data from related literature, concludes that the total area covered by the herb in China reaches 34,178 ha, mainly in eastern Jiangsu Province, Shanghai Municipality and Zhejiang Province, accounting for 94.22% of the country's total. Its total annual biomass reaches 2.53 Mt, producing 39 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 1.33 Mt of standard coal. The annual biomass of its above-ground parts is 1.12 Mt, producing 18 PJ bioenergy, equivalent to that of 0.61 Mt of standard coal. Besides, it also has strong carbon sequestration capabilities, its annual C stock amounting to 1.16 Mt, or 4.25 Mt of CO2. Therefore it is very significant for the carbon cycle of the ocean ecosystem. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this work, the effect of temperature (288-318K) and pH (2-11) of the electrolyte on decholrination of trichloroacetic acid (TCA) was investigated in the sodium alginate/hemoglobin-multiwalled carbon nanotubes-graphite composite electrode (Hb/SA-MWCNT-GE). The results showed that the most favourable degradation conditions for TCA by Hb/SA-MWCNT-GE were found to be pH 3 and 310 K. By varying the pH of the systems, it was found that a proton accompanied with an electron transfer between the electrode and heme Fe(III)/Fe(II) of Hb during the reaction. Additionally, the activation energy of 26.2 kJ mol(-1) was also calculated by the Arrhenius equation for the reaction. The total mass balance of the reactant and the products was in the range of 97-105% during the bioelectrochemically reductive reaction. The CE only. decreased from 87% to 83% when the Eb/SA-MWCNT-GE was used 5 times. Based on the intermediates detected, a pathway was proposed for TCA degradation in which it underwent dechlorination process. The main degradation mechanism described by a parallel reaction. rather than by a sequential reaction for dechlorination of TCA in Hb/SA-MWCNT-GE system was proposed. These data provided relevant information about the applicability of bioelectrocatalytic systems for treatment of wastewater contaminated by COCs. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

R164C mutation in FOXQ1 H3 domain affects formation of the hair medulla	EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY			English	Article						Foxq1; satin; hair fibre; medulla; gene networks; mouse model	MELANOCYTE-STIMULATING HORMONE; NF-KAPPA-B; MELANOCORTIN-1 RECEPTOR; ULTRAVIOLET-RADIATION; ALPHA-MSH; T-CELLS; MICE; MC1R; MOUSE; SKIN	A number of single gene mutations in laboratory mice produce hair follicle defects resulting in deformed hair shafts. The radiation-induced (SB/LeJ-Foxq1(sa)) satin mutant mice have a satin-like sheen to their hair and dilute colouration. This sheen is due to failure of the hair shafts to develop normal medullas, while the pigment dilution is due to the unrelated beige (lysosomal trafficking regulator, Lyst(bg)) mutation. A new allelic mutation, Foxq1(sa-J), arose spontaneously on the albino (tyrosinase, Tyr(c)) MRL/MpJ-Fas(lpr) background. The Foxq1(sa-J) allele has a C to T transition at position 490. By contrast, the Foxq1(sa) mutant allele was confirmed to be a 67 base pair deletion followed by two base changes (GA to AT). Morphologic changes were similar to those seen in Hoxc13 transgenic and targeted mutant mice. This new allelic mutation provides yet another tool to investigate formation of the interior structures of hair shafts.	[Wu, Baojin; Pratt, C.

Coal fires burn valuable coal reserves and lead to severe environmental degradation of the region. Moreover, coal fires can result in massive surface displacements due to the reduction in volume of the burning coal and can cause thermal effects in the adjacent rock mass particularly cracks and fissures. The Wuda coalfield in Northern China is known for being an exclusive storehouse of prime coking coal as well as for being the site of occurrence of the maximum number of known coal fires among all the coalfields in China and worldwide, and is chosen as our study area. In this study, we have investigated the capabilities and limitations of ALOS PALSAR data for monitoring the land subsidence that accompanies coal fires by means of satellite differential interferometric synthetic aperture radar (DInSAR) observations. An approach to map the large and highly non-linear subsidence based on a small number of SAR images was applied to the Wuda coalfield to reveal the spatial and temporal signals of land subsidence in areas affected by coal fires. The DInSAR results agree well with coal fire data obtained from field investigations and thermal anomaly information, which demonstrates that the capability of ALOS PALSAR data and the proposed approach have remarkable potential to detect this land subsidence of interest. In addition, our results also provide a spatial extent and temporal evolution of the land subsidence behavior accompanying the coal fires, which indicated that several coal fire zones suffer accelerated ongoing land subsidence, whilst other coal fire zones are newly subsiding areas arising from coal fires in the period of development.

Due to the uncertainty, sensor reports can be represented by fuzzy sets in order to efficiently deal with signal processing. In this article, a methodology to combine sensor reports in fuzzy environments based on DempsterShafer evidence theory is proposed. The basic probability assignment function is constructed by means of member functions. The numerical example on object recognition of a robot arm is shown to illustrate the efficiency of the presented approach.

With the hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water 5/6/5/6 (v/v) system, 300mg of G. pentaphyllum tea extract were fractionated on a 180mL-capacity preparative hydrodynamic CCC column. Satisfactory separation efficiency was achieved, producing milligram-amounts of quercetin, isorhamnetin, and cirsiliol over 90% pure in one EECCC process. Due to the hydrophilic property, the major flavonoid glycoside, rutin, was co-eluted with the solvent front as a mixture. Therefore, another carefully selected biphasic liquid system composed of ethyl acetate/n-butanol/water (4/1/5, v/v) was employed, yielding 35mg of rutin with 97.1% purity. Structures of all separated compounds were identified by ESI-MS, 1H NMR, and 13C NMR.

Elimination of benzene was observed besides hydride transfer and electron transfer reactions. D-labeling experiments and accurate mass determinations of the product ions confirm that the external proton is retained in the fragment ion, and the elimination reaction was proposed to be initiated by benzyl cation transfer rather than proton transfer. Benzyl cation transfer from the nitrogen atom to one of the sp(2)-hybridized carbon atoms in the indoline core is the key step, and subsequent proton transfer reaction leads to the elimination of benzene. Density functional theory (DFT)-based calculations were performed and the computational results also support the benzyl cation/proton transfer mechanism.

However, little is known about mechanisms of excitatory synapse formation in inhibitory neurons. Here we demonstrate that Erbin is specifically expressed in cortical inhibitory neurons. It localizes at excitatory synapses and regulates AMPA receptor (AMPAR) surface expression. Erbin mutation reduced mEPSCs and AMPAR currents specifically in parvalbumin (PV)-positive interneurons but not in pyramidal neurons. We found that the AMPAR auxiliary protein TARP gamma-2 was specifically expressed in cortical interneurons. Erbin interacts with TARP gamma-2 and is crucial for its stability. Deletion of the gamma-2-interacting domain in Erbin attenuated surface AMPAR and excitatory transmission in PV-positive interneurons. Furthermore, we observed behavioral deficits in Erbin-null mice and in mice expressing an Erbin truncation mutant that is unable to interact with TARP gamma-2. These observations demonstrate a crucial function for Erbin in AMPAR surface expression in cortical PV-positive interneurons and may contribute to a better understanding of psychiatric disorders.

Serum bottles were used as experimental containers in batch tests to analyze the short-term response of the ANAMMOX process under sulfide stress. The IC50 of sulfide-S for ANAMMOX biomass was substrates-dependent and was calculated to be 264 mg L-1 at an initial total nitrogen level of 200 mg L-1 (molar ratio of ammonium and nitrite was 1:1). The long-term effects and the performance recovery under sulfide stress were continuously monitored and evaluated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. The performance of the ANAMMOX system was halved at an sulfide-S level of 32 mg L-1 within 13 days; however, the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) decreased by only 17.2% within 18 days at an sulfide-S concentration of 40 mg L-1 after long-time acclimatization of sludge in the presence of sulfide. The ANAMMOX performance recovered under sulfide-S level of 8 mg L-1 with a steady NRR increasing speed, linear relationship between the NRR and operation time. The synchronic reduce in the specific ANAMMOX activity and the biomass extended the apparent doubling time of the nitrogen removal capacity and decreased biomass growth rate. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

To yield a bioactive RNAi functionalized matrix for skin regeneration with inhibited scarring, collagen-chitosan/silicone membrane bilayer dermal equivalent (BDE) was combined with trimetylchitosan (TMC)/siRNA complexes which could induce suppression of transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) pathway. The RNAi-BDE functioned as a reservoir for the incorporated TMC/siRNA complexes, enabling a prolonged siRNA release. The seeded fibroblasts in the RNAi-BDE showed good viability, internalized the TMC/siRNA complexes effectively and suppressed TGF-beta 1 expression constantly until 14 d. Application of the RNAi-BDE on the full-thickness skin defects of pig backs confirmed the in vivo inhibition of TGF-beta 1 expression by immunohistochemistry, real-time quantitative PCR and western blotting during 30 d post surgery. The levels of other scar-related factors such as collagen type I, collagen type III and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were also down-regulated. In combination with the ultra-thin skin graft transplantation for 73 d, the regenerated skin by RNAi-BDE had an extremely similar structure to that of the normal one.

The enzyme was thermally stable and displayed the highest activity at 70 A degrees C and pH 6.0. It preferred NAD(H) over NADP(H) as a cofactor and exhibited broad substrate specificity towards aliphatic ketones, cycloalkanones, aromatic ketones, and ketoesters. Furthermore, ethyl benzoylformate was asymmetrically reduced by the purified enzyme, using an additional coupled NADH regeneration system, with 95 % conversion and in an enantiomeric excess of (99.9 %). The results of this study may lead to the discovery of a novel method for asymmetric reduction of alcohols, which is an important tool in organic synthesis.

Different Oxygen Vacancy Influence on the Electronic Structure of Ca4Al2O6-y Fe2As2 Superconductor	JOURNAL OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND NOVEL MAGNETISM			English	Article						Ca4Al2O6-yFe2As2 superconductor; Oxygen vacancy; Electronic structure		By means of density functional theory from first principle study, we calculate the band structure and DOS and PDOS of the Ca4Al2O6-x Fe2As2 and compare the DOS and PDOS among the Ca4Al2O6-x Fe2As2 with O1 (4f site), O2 (2c site) vacancy (x=0.2) and no oxygen vacancy (x=0). It is inferred that both the O1 and O2 vacancies of the Ca4Al2O6-x Fe2As2 are beneficial for improving its conductivity and the reason why parent Ca4Al2O6-x Fe2As2 is a superconductor probably results from the oxygen vacancy. These results are helpful for explaining the reason why some parent 426 iron-based compounds are superconductors and for synthesizing new 42622-type structured iron-based superconductors with oxygen vacancy.

In order to overcome the bias of the usual profile least squares estimation when measurement errors are ignored, we propose a modified profile least squares estimator of the regression parameter and construct estimators of the nonlinear coefficient function and error variance. The proposed three estimators are proved to be asymptotically normal under mild conditions. In addition, we introduce the profile likelihood ratio test and then demonstrate that it follows an asymptotically chi(2) distribution under the null hypothesis. Finite sample behavior of the estimators is investigated via simulations too. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By using the characteristic analysis method, we prove the global existence of solutions to the Riemann problem constructively under the Lax entropy condition. The image of contact discontinuity in magnetogasdynamics is a curve with u - Const. in the (tau, p, u) space. Its projection on the (p, u) plane is a straight line that parallels to the p-axis. In contrast with the problem in gas dynamics, the result causes more complicated and difficult than that in gas dynamics.

Here we study the noise properties of the transport current in the lasing regime, i.e. both the zero-frequency shot noise and the noise spectrum. The former shows a remarkable super-Poissonian behavior when the system approaches the lasing transition, but a sub-Poissonian behavior deep in the lasing state. The noise spectrum contains information about the coherent dynamics of the coupled dot-resonator system. It shows pronounced structures at frequencies matching that of the resonator due to the excitation of photons. For strong interdot Coulomb interaction, we observe asymmetries in the auto-correlation noise spectra of the left and right junctions, which we trace back to asymmetries in the incoherent tunneling channels.

Tunable interplay between 3d and 4 f electrons in Co-doped iron pnictides	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; PAIRING SYMMETRY; CRITICAL-FIELD; PERSPECTIVES; STATE; SPIN	We study the interplay of 3d and 4f electrons in the iron pnictides CeFe1-xCoxAsO and GdFe1-yCoyAsO, which correspond to two very different cases of 4 f-magnetic moment. Both CeFeAsO and GdFeAsO undergo a spin-density-wave (SDW) transition associated with Fe 3d electrons at high temperatures, which is rapidly suppressed by Fe/Co substitution. Superconductivity appears in a narrow doping range: 0.05 < x < 0.2 for CeFe1-xCoxAsO and 0.05 < y < 0.25 for GdFe1-yCoyAsO, showing a maximum transition temperature T-sc of about 13.5 K for Ce and 19 K for Gd. In both compounds, the 4f electrons form an antiferromagnetic (AFM) order at low temperatures over the entire doping range and Co 3d electrons are ferromagnetically ordered on the Co-rich side; the Curie temperature reaches T-C(Co) approximate to 75 K at x = 1 and y = 1. In the Ce compounds, the Neel temperature T-N(Ce) increases upon suppressing the SDW transition of Fe and then remains nearly unchanged with further increasing Co concentration up to x similar or equal to 0.8 (T-N(Ce) approximate to 4K). Furthermore, evidence of Co-induced polarization on Ce moments is observed on the Co-rich side. In the Gd compounds, the two magnetic species of Gd and Co are coupled antiferromagnetically to give rise to ferrimagnetic behavior in the magnetic susceptibility on the Co-rich side. For 0.7 <= y <= 1.0, the system undergoes a possible magnetic reorientation below the Neel temperature of Gd (T-N(Gd)). Our results suggest that the effects of both electron hybridizations and magnetic exchange coupling between the 3d-4f electrons give rise to a rich phase diagram in the rare-earth iron pnictides.

Given that the most overlapping characteristics found between HIV-1 LTNP and latency, detailed analysis of the difference would disclose the essentials of latency. In this study, microarray data from our previous study was combined with HIV-1 latency and LTNP data obtained from NCBI GEO database. Principal variance component analysis and hierarchical clustering verified the removal of batch effect across platform. The analysis revealed a total of 456 differential expressed genes with >2-fold change and B-statistic >0. Bayesian inference was used to reconstitute the transcriptional network of HIV-1 latency or LTNP, respectively. Gene regulation was reprogrammed under different disease condition. By network interference, KPNA2 and ATP5G3 were identified as the hubs in latency network which mediate nuclear export and RNA processing. These data offer comparative insights into HIV-1 latency, which will facilitate the understanding of the genetic basis of HIV-1 latency in vivo and serve as a clue for future treatment dealing with key targets in HIV-1 latency.

We first derive the explicit formulas of these two quantities for a single qubit in terms of the Bloch vector. Moreover, we obtain analytical results for them under three different decoherence channels, which are expressed as affine transformation matrices. Using the hierarchy equation method, we numerically study the dynamics of both sets of information in a dissipative model and compare the numerical results with the analytical ones obtained by applying the rotating-wave approximation. We further express the two information quantities in terms of the Bloch vector for a qudit by expanding the density matrix and Hermitian operators in a common set of generators of the Lie algebra su(d). By calculating the dynamical quantum Fisher information, we find that the collisional dephasing significantly diminishes the precision of the phase parameter with the Ramsey interferometry.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of the near-threshold omega phi mass enhancement in doubly OZI-suppressed J/psi -> gamma omega phi decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								A 2:25 x 10(8) J/psi event sample accumulated with the BESIII detector is used to study the doubly Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka-suppressed decay modes J/psi -> gamma omega phi, omega -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0), phi -> K+K-. A strong deviation (> 30 sigma) from three-body J/psi -> gamma omega phi phase space is observed near the omega phi mass threshold that is consistent with a previous observation reported by the BESII experiment. A partial wave analysis with a tensor covariant amplitude that assumes that the enhancement is due to the presence of a resonance, the X(1810), is performed and confirms that the spin-parity of the X(1810) is 0(++). The mass and width of the X(1810) are determined to be M = 1795 +/- 7(stat)(-5)(+13) (syst) +/- 19(mod) MeV/c(2) and Gamma = 95 +/- 10(stat)(-34)(+21)(syst) +/- 75(mod) MeV/c(2), respectively, and the product branching fraction is measured to be B(J/psi -> gamma X(1810)) x B(X(1810) -> omega phi) = (2.00 +/- 0.08(stat)(-1.00)(+0.45)(syst) +/- 1.30(mod)) x 10(-4). These results are consistent within errors with those of the BESII experiment. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.032008	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J.

We also show that a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state of four superconducting qubits embedded in four different resonators can be created with this scheme. In principle, the proposed method can be extended to create an entangled coherent state of n resonators and to prepare a (GHZ) state of n qubits distributed over n cavities in a quantum network. In addition, it is noted that four resonators coupled by a coupler qutrit may be used as a basic circuit block to build a two-dimensional quantum network, which is useful for scalable quantum information processing.

In the cytoplasm, the miRNA strand is selectively incorporated into a specific Argonaute (AGO)-associated gene silencing complex, while the miRNA* is degraded rapidly. Thus, most miRNA*s were thought to be biologically meaningless. Interestingly, several recent reports in both plants and animals have shaken this notion. Many miRNA*s were demonstrated to possess regulatory roles in gene expression. However, the low accumulation levels of most miRNA*s raise the question whether the activities of this small RNA (sRNA) species are widespread in plants. Here, by using publicly available sRNA high-throughput sequencing data, we found that the accumulation levels of several miRNA*s could be much higher than those of their miRNA partners in certain organs, mutants and/or AGO-associated silencing complexes of both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). Based on target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, some of these highly accumulated miRNA*s were indicated to possess cleavage-based potential regulatory role on certain targets. Besides, some interesting biological interpretations were obtained based on the accumulation patterns of the miRNA*s, the annotations of the target genes, and literature mining. Taken together, the expanded list of the highly accumulated miRNA*s along with their potential target genes discovered in this study further strengthened the current notion that certain members of the miRNA* species are biologically relevant, which needs further inspection.

PPC and CAB were partially miscible because of the drastically shifted glass transition temperatures of both PPC and CAB, which originated from the specific interactions between carbonyl groups and hydroxyl groups. The incorporation of CAB into PPC matrix enhanced not only tensile strength and modulus of PPC dramatically, but also improved heat resistance and thermal stability of PPC significantly. The tensile strength and the modulus of PPC/CAB = 50/50 blend are 27.7 MPa and 1.24 GPa, which are 21 times and 28 times higher than those of the unmodified PPC, respectively. Moreover, the elongation at break of PPC/CAB = 50/50 blend is as high as 117%. In addition, the obtained blends exhibited good transparency, which is very important for the package materials. The results in this work pave new possibility for the massive application of eco-friendly polymer materials. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for eta and eta ' -> pi(+)e(-)(v)over-bar(e) + c.c. decays in J/psi -> phi eta and phi eta '	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DECAY; MESON	Using a sample of 225.3 million J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII e(+)e(-) collider in 2009, searches for the decays of eta and eta' -> pi(+)e(-)(v) over bar (e) + c.c. in J/psi -> phi eta and phi eta' are performed. The phi signals, which are reconstructed in K+K- final states, are used to tag eta and eta' semileptonic decays. No signals are observed for either eta or eta', and upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined to be 7.3 x 10(-4) and 5.0 x 10(-4) for the ratios B(eta ->pi(+)e(-)(v) over bar (e) + c.c)/B(eta ->pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)) and B(eta'->pi(+)e(-)(v) over bar (e) + c.c)/B(eta'->pi(+)pi(-)eta) respectively. These are the first upper- limit values determined for eta and eta' semileptonic weak decays. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.032006	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Calcaterra, A.; Cao, G.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurements of baryon pair decays of chi(cJ) mesons	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using 106 x 10(6) psi' decays collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII, three decays of chi(cJ) (J = 0, 1, 2) with baryon pairs (Lambda(Lambda) over bar, Sigma(0)(Sigma) over bar (0),Sigma(+)(Sigma) over bar (-)) in the final state have been studied. The branching fractions are measured to be B(chi(c0,1,2) -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar) = (33.3 +/- 2.0 +/- 2.6) x 10(-5), (12.2 +/- 1.1 +/- 1.1) x 10(-5), (20.8 +/- 1.6 +/- 2.3) x 10(-5), B(chi(c0,1,2) -> Sigma(0)(Sigma) over bar (0)) = (47.8 +/- 3.4 +/- 3.9) x 10(-5), (3.8 +/- 1.0 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5), (4.0 +/- 1.1 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5), and B(chi(c0,1,2) -> Sigma(+)(Sigma) over bar (-)) = (45.4 +/- 4.2 +/- 3.0) x 10(-5), (5.4 +/- 1.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5), (4.9 +/- 1.9 +/- 0.7) x 10(-5), where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. Upper limits on the branching fractions for the decays of chi(c1,2) -> Sigma(0)(Sigma) over bar (0), Sigma(+)(Sigma) over bar (-) are estimated to be B(chi(c1) -> Sigma(0)(Sigma) over bar (0)) 6.2 x 10(-5), B(chi(c2) -> Sigma(0)<(Sigma) over bar (0)) 6.5 x 10(-5), B(chi(c1) -> Sigma(+)<(Sigma) over bar (-)) 8.7 x 10(-5) and B(chi(c2) -> Sigma(+)<(Sigma) over bar (-)) < 8.8 x 10(-5) at the 90% confidence level.

J	Wang, YL; Ding, Y				Wang, Yanli; Ding, Yi			Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Properties of the Semifluorinated Boron Nitride Bilayer: A First-Principles Study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELASTIC BAND METHOD; GRAPHENE; NANOTUBES; DIAMONDIZATION; NANORIBBONS; NANOSHEETS; GAP	Using density functional theory calculations with dispersion correction, we present a comprehensive study on the semifluorinated boron nitride (BN) bilayers. We find that the semifluorination leads to a nonbonded configuration in BN bilayers spontaneously, which would transform to the diamondized configuration via moderate pressure. Due to the combined effect of intrinsic intralayer strain and interlayer charge transfer, the ferromagnetic coupling is favored in both configurations, which exhibit intriguing half-metallic behavior for BN bilayers. While these nonbonded and diamondized configurations could undergo a 2 x 1 reconstruction, this requires overcoming a fair energy barrier owing to the sliding and warping of BN planes. With such reconstruction, the stability is greatly enhanced, and the system is converted into a nonmagnetic direct-band-gap semiconductor. Our studies demonstrate that the semifluorination can bring diverse electronic and magnetic properties into the BN bilayer, which could be half-metals or semiconductors depending on the structural types and would have potential applications in spintronics and nanodevices.

Formation of [3]Catenanes from 10 Precursors via Multicomponent Coordination-Driven Self-Assembly of Metallarectangles	JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY			English	Article							SYNTHETIC MOLECULAR MOTORS; DONOR-ACCEPTOR; ORGANOPLATINUM(II) METALLACYCLES; 1,2-BIS(PYRIDINIUM)ETHANE AXLES; INTERLOCKED STRUCTURES; DIRECTED SYNTHESIS; OLEFIN METATHESIS; CLICK CHEMISTRY; ETHER WHEELS; CATENATION	We describe the formation of a suite of [3]catenanes via multicomponent coordination-driven self-assembly and host-guest complexation of a rectangular scaffold comprising a 90 degrees Pt-based acceptor building block with a pseudorotaxane bis(pyridinium)ethane/dibenzo-24-crown-8 linear dipyridyl ligand and three dicarboxylate donors. The doubly threaded [3]catenanes are formed from a total of 10 molecular components from four unique species. Furthermore, the dynamic catenation process is reversible and can be switched off and on in a controllable manner by successive addition of KPF6 and 18-crown-6, as monitored by H-1 and P-31 NMR spectroscopy.

Dynamic approach to finite-temperature magnetic phase transitions in the extended J(1)-J(2) model with vacancy order	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO; ISING-MODEL; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; COEXISTENCE; BEHAVIOR	The recently discovered iron-based superconductors A(y)Fe(2-x)Se(2) (A = K, Rb, Cs, Tl) show a long-range antiferromagnetic order with an unexpectedly high transition temperature T-N similar to 550 K and a unique root 5 x root 5 vacancy order. Taking the extended J(1)-J(2) model as a minimal model, we investigate the finite-temperature magnetic phase transitions in a square lattice with a root 5 x root 5 vacancy superstructure by using large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. By the parallel tempering technique, the block spin checkerboard and stripe antiferromagnetic states are detected to be the ground states for three representative sets of model parameters. The short-time dynamic approach is applied to accurately determine the critical temperature as well as the static and dynamic exponents. Our results indicate that the dramatic enhancement of the critical temperature as observed in experiments should be mainly due to a combination of the vacancy order and the block lattice contraction.

The compounds were characterized by NMR spectroscopy (H-1, C-13, Si-29), MALDI-TOF and ESI MS. Most of them have also been characterized using X-ray crystallography, including some polymorphs. The packing systems of the octa-n-alkylsilsesquioxanes are reported. Two types of packing have been observed, rod-like and disk-like (interdigitated). Some n-alkylPOSS crystals were formed in which the chains are tilted away from the axes of the cubic core. It was also observed that as alkyl-chains are flexible they can take up a variety of conformations. Melting points of the homologous series showed an odd-even alternating effect for alkyl chains longer than four CH2 units. The TGA of n-alkylPOSS under nitrogen showed that the thermal stability temperatures are between 200 and 400 degrees C. Pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry has been used to elucidate the thermal degradation process of T-8(n-CnH2n+1)(8) (n = 11 and 18). Thermal cracking along the whole alkyl chain was observed rather than simple loss of the complete arm.

In particular, the microscopic organizing principles of directed networks are less understood than those of undirected networks. This article proposes a hypothesis named potential theory, which assumes that every directed link corresponds to a decrease of a unit potential and subgraphs with definable potential values for all nodes are preferred. Combining the potential theory with the clustering and homophily mechanisms, it is deduced that the Bi-fan structure consisting of 4 nodes and 4 directed links is the most favored local structure in directed networks. Our hypothesis receives strongly positive supports from extensive experiments on 15 directed networks drawn from disparate fields, as indicated by the most accurate and robust performance of Bi-fan predictor within the link prediction framework. In summary, our main contribution is twofold: (i) We propose a new mechanism for the local organization of directed networks; (ii) We design the corresponding link prediction algorithm, which can not only testify our hypothesis, but also find out direct applications in missing link prediction and friendship recommendation.

BESIII Collaboration	Evidence for eta(c) -> gamma gamma and measurement of J/psi -> 3 gamma	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DECAY-RATE; POSITRONIUM; PRECISION	The decay of J/psi to three photons is studied using psi (3686) -> pi(+) pi(-) J/psi in a sample of 1.0641 X 10(8) psi (3686) events collected with the BESIII detector. Evidence of the direct decay of eta(c) to two photons, eta(c) -> gamma gamma, is reported, and the product branching fraction is determined to be B(J/psi -> gamma eta(c,) eta(c) -> gamma gamma = (4.5 +/- 1.2 +/- 0.6) X 10(-6), where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. The branching fraction for J/psi -> 3 gamma is measured to be (11.3 +/- 1.8 +/- 2.0) X 10(-6) with improved precision. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.032003	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; An, Z. H.; Bai, J.

The primary task of quantum networks is to distribute entanglement between remote nodes. Although quantum repeater protocol enables long distance entanglement distribution, it has been restricted to one-dimensional linear network. Here we develop a general framework that allows application of quantum repeater protocol to arbitrary quantum repeater networks with fractal structure. Entanglement distribution across such networks is mapped to renormalization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that logarithmical times of recursive such renormalization transformations can trigger fractal to small-world transition, where a scalable quantum small-world network is achieved. Our result provides new insight into quantum repeater theory towards realistic construction of large-scale quantum networks.

Reduced Regional Gray Matter Volume in Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease: A Voxel-Based Morphometry Study	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							BRAIN; HYPOXIA; CORTEX; ABNORMALITIES; HYPERCAPNIA; INSULA; COPD	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Decreased oxygen supply may cause neuronal damage in the brains of patients with COPD, which is manifested by clinical symptoms such as neuropsychological deficits and mood disorders. The aim of the present study was to investigate brain gray matter change in COPD. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using voxel-based morphometry based on the high-resolution 3D T1-weighted MR images of GM volume, we investigated 25 stable patients with COPD and 25 matching healthy volunteers. A battery of neuropsychological tests was also performed. RESULTS: Patients with COPD (versus controls) showed reduced GM volume in the frontal cortex (bilateral gyrus rectus, bilateral orbital and inferior triangular gyri, and left medial superior gyrus), right anterior insula, cingulate cortex (left anterior and middle gyri, right middle gyrus), right thalamus/pulvinar, right caudate, right putamen, right parahippocampus, and left amygdala. In COPD, in some of these regions, regional GM volume had positive correlations with arterial blood po(2), while in some regions, regional GM volume had negative correlations with disease duration. Patients with COPD (versus controls) had poorer performance in the Mini-Mental State Examination, Visual Reproduction, and Figure Memory tests. Moreover, the GM volume in the inferior triangular frontal cortex in patients with COPD was significantly correlated with the Picture Memory score. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest GM reductions in a number of brain regions in COPD, which were associated with disease severity and may underlie the pathophysiologic and psychological changes in patients with COPD.

The OTC inhibition of Anammox was substrate-, and especially nitrite-, dependent. The IC50 of OTC in the batch tests on an Anammox mixed culture was calculated to be 517.5 mg L-1. The long-term effects of OTC on the Anammox process were examined in a continuous-flow upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor. Fifty milligrams per liter of OTC significantly decreased the nitrogen removal rate from 12.4 to 2 kg N m(-3) d(-1) within 26 days. The recovery of Anammox performance after OTC inhibition was accelerated by adding biocatalyst. In contrast to the modified Stover-Kincannon model, the modified Boltzmann model accurately simulated the recovery of Anammox performance. OTC presented in the influent led to sludge hardening and cell lysis. A poor settling property of Anammox sludge was also observed. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this proposal, there is no need to use classical pulses during the entire gate operation. The gate operation time scales as root n only and thus the gate can be performed faster when compared with sending atoms through the cavity one at a time. In addition, only three operational steps are required to realize this n-target-qubit controlled-phase gate. This proposal is quite general and can be applied to other physical systems, such as various superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator, NV centers coupled to a microsphere cavity, or quantum dots in cavity QED.

Gd@C-82 was firstly reacted with diethyl bromomalonate in the presence of alkali metal hydride to produce malonic ester multiadducted derivatives, Gd@C-82[C(OOCH2CH3)(2)](x) (x = 3-8), by Bingel reaction. They were isolated and purified to obtain Gd@C-82[C(COOCH2CH3)(2)](6) and Gd@C-82[C(COOCH2CH3)(2)](8) by silica-gel column chromatography with a gradient elution method, which were subsequently hydrolyzed to yield water-soluble Gd@C-82[C(COOH)(2)](6) and Gd@C-82[C(COOH)(2)](8) by Hirsch reaction. The structures of the derivatives were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. The longitudinal relaxivities of Gd@C-82[C(COOH)(2)](8) and Gd@C-82[C(COOH)(2)](6), in buffer solution, were found to be 18.20 and 11.08 mM(-1) s(-1) concentration range between 0.001-0.025 mM Gd, and to be 12.71 and 6.73 mM(-1) s(-1) between 0.050-0.200 mM Gd, respectively. The results showed that the measured relaxivities for malonate derivatives of Gd@C-82 were dependent on the concentration of these solutions and the number of hydrophilic carboxyl groups appended on the surface of the Gd@C-82 cage.

J	Ying, Y				Ying, Ying			An Interpretation of the "Fog" in New Grub Street	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						New Grub Street; fog literary field; low degree of autonomy		"Fog" is an important symbol in George Gissing's New Grub Street, which repeatedly appears in a lurid way. This effect not only emanates from its wide coverage, but is more significantly associated with its intimate relation with the rise and fall of the men of letters. A close examination of the change, connotation, and influence of the "fog" reveals the nature of the "fog" and, further, unveils a specific emblematic meaning of the "fog", namely, a symbol of the late 19th-century British literary world which is a literary field with low degree of autonomy and poses a dire threat to serious writers. On that account, the symbol of fog helps express the theme and enriches the connotation of fog in the 19th-century artistic works.

The present study demonstrates a unique cascade chirality transfer in a [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement that leads to chiral diols with three stereogenic centers, which include a chiral sp(3) center at the alcohol and C-2-axial chirality. Screening these ligands in the arylation of aromatic aldehydes with Grignard reagents shows that the naphthyl-substituted BINMOL promotes the aryl transfer reaction in good yields (70-92%) and moderate-to-good enantioselectivities (up to 72% ee), and a series of control experiments substantiates that the axial chirality and the chiral sp(3) center at the alcohol of the Ar-BINMOLs are the pivotal enantioselectivity-controlling structure elements. In addition, this study demonstrated the importance of the chiral sp(3) center at the alcohol on Ar-BINMOL for the aryl transfer reaction. Finally, we found that the chiral Ar-BINMOL ligand 2h mediated the titanium-promoted 1,2-addition of MeMgBr to aldehydes to give the desired products in good yields with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 92% ee).

Various factors, such as the buildup of pests in the soil, disorder in physico-chemical soil properties, autotoxicity, and other unknown factors may contribute to soil sickness. A range of autotoxins have been identified, and these exhibit their allelopathic potential by influencing cell division, water and ion uptake, dark respiration, ATP synthesis, redox homeostasis, gene expression, and defense responses. Meanwhile, there are great interspecific and intraspecific differences in the uptake and accumulation of autotoxins, which contribute to the specific differences in growth in response to different autotoxins. Importantly, the autotoxins also influence soil microbes and vice versa, leading to an increased or decreased degree of soil sickness. In many cases, autotoxins may enhance soilborne diseases by predisposing the roots to infection by soilborne pathogens through a direct biochemical and physiological effect. Some approaches, such as screening for low autotoxic potential and disease-resistant genotypes, proper rotation and intercropping, proper soil and plant residue management, adoption of resistant plant species as rootstocks, introduction of beneficial microbes, physical removal of phytotoxins, and soil sterilization, are proposed. We discuss the challenges that we are facing and possible approaches to these.

Maps of temperature-based agro-meteorological indices are commonly generated by the spatial interpolation of data collected from meteorological stations with coarse geographic continuity. To solve the critical problems of estimating air temperature (T-a) and filling in missing pixels due to cloudy and low-quality images in growing degree days (GDDs) calculation from remotely sensed data, a novel spatio-temporal algorithm for T-a estimation from Terra and Aqua moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) data was proposed. This is a preliminary study to calculate heat accumulation, expressed in accumulative growing degree days (AGDDs) above 10 degrees C, from reconstructed T-a based on MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data. The verification results of maximum T-a, minimum T-a, GDD, and AGDD from MODIS-derived data to meteorological calculation were all satisfied with high correlations over 0.01 significant levels. Overall, MODIS-derived AGDD was slightly underestimated with almost 10% relative error. However, the feasibility of employing AGDD anomaly maps to characterize the 2001-2010 spatio-temporal variability of heat accumulation and estimating the 2011 heat accumulation distribution using only MODIS data was finally demonstrated in the current paper. Our study may supply a novel way to calculate AGDD in heat-related study concerning crop growth monitoring, agricultural climatic regionalization, and agro-meteorological disaster detection at the regional scale.

It is found that the outer regions of the as-grown sample change from crystalline to amorphous, and ZnO core-shell NWs with ZnO nanocrystals embedded are formed after Ar+ milling. Optical properties of the ZnO NWs have been investigated systematically through power and temperature dependent photoluminescence measurements, and the phenomenon of exciton localization as well as the relevant favorable photoluminescence characteristics is elucidated. Interestingly, under high density optical pumping at room temperature, coherent random lasing action is observed, which is ascribed to exciton localization and strong scattering. Our results on the unique optical properties of localized exciton in ZnO core-shell nanostructures shed light on developing stable and high-efficiency excitonic optoelectronic devices such as light-emitting diodes and lasers.

Herein, we developed a strategy to improve these performances of epoxy by combining the multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) and spherical particles. Two different types of spherical particles i.e. soft submicron-rubber and rigid nano-silica particles were chosen to modify the epoxy/MWCNT composites. Compared with the binary composites with single-phase particles, the ternary composites with MWCNTs and spherical particles offer a good balance in glass transition temperature, electrical conductivity, stiffness and strength, as well as fracture toughness, exhibiting capacities in tailoring the electrical and mechanical properties of epoxy composites.

The reductive deoxygenation of aromatic ketones and benzylic alcohols, including secondary alcohols, to the corresponding methylene hydrocarbons has been achieved in good to excellent yields using palladium chloride (PdCl2) as catalyst and PMHS as hydride source. Such deoxygenations were successfully with aryl alkyl ketones and diaryl ketones, as exemplified by the reductive deoxygenation of acetophenone and benzopheneone, respectively. The corresponding benzylic alcohols and secondary alcohol analogues could also be converted into their respective methylene hydrocarbons by the PdCl2/PMHS system.

Photoperiod influences diapause beyond the maternal generation in Cotesia vestalis (Haliday) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae). In this study, we measured glycogen content and the activity and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase at different G(0) (25 A degrees C under light:dark photoperiods of 8L:16D, 12L:12D, and 16L:8D) and G(1) life stages (13 A degrees C under 8L:16D). Glycogen content in G(0) and G(1) increased with shorter light periods, except for G(0) adult males, which showed no significant difference under the three photoperiods. Compared with those under 16 h, in those under 8 h light, glycogen synthase activity was significantly higher at all tested stages, except for G(0) pupa and adult male, for which it was identical; mRNA expression was higher at G(0) larva and prepupa, lower at pupa, and identical at rest stages. Glycogen phosphorylase activity was significantly higher for G(1) egg, lower at G(1) prepupa, and identical at all other stages; mRNA expression was higher at G(0) and G(1) larval stages, and similar at rest stages. These findings suggest that glycogen, being regulated by the two enzymes, may be a consequential factor in the transmission of maternal information and diapause induction of C. vestalis.

Advances in virtual and augmented reality, real-time computer graphics and computer games have made it possible to construct large virtual environments in which users may experience cultural heritage through a variety of interactions and immersions. Thus, an emerging problem is to implement an appropriate systematic design method for achieving various types of entertainment, learning and information transfer. This paper proposes two important design factors that impact on user immersion in serious heritage games: user interface space volume and subsystem sequence. The impact of the two factors on proposed systematic design methods was investigated through comparative studies by implementing a serious heritage game system on three different platforms.

It is found that both systems exhibit a strain-induced self-doping phenomenon, which is closely related with their buckled structures and cannot arise in graphene. Under the compressive strain, the Dirac point is moved below the Fermi level, making the nanosheets behave as n-type doped. While under the tensile strain, the p-type doping is rendered by shifting the Dirac point above the Fermi level. Our studies demonstrate that the n-type/zero-band-gap/p-type semiconducting features can be switched for silicene and germanene by applying strains. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

For pyrene-based chromophores, however, this is not always true. In this contribution, two new methylated tetraphenylpyrenes, 1,3,6,8-tetra-o-tolylpyrene (TTPy) and 1,3,6,8-tetrakis(3,5-dimethylphenyl)pyrene (TDMPPy), were synthesized through Suzuki coupling reactions. TDMPPy absorbs and emits light at longer wavelengths than TTPy due to its more planar conformation and thus better conjugation. TDMPPy is prone to excimer formation, thus leading to a strong bathochromic shift (84 nm) in the photoluminescence spectrum of its film. TDMPPy exhibits efficient electroluminescence originating from pyrene excimers, affording a maximum luminance of 26?670 cd?m-2 and a current efficiency as high as 10.8 cd?A-1 in a non-doped OLED (ITO/PEDOT:PSS (50 nm)/NPB (30 nm)/TDMPPy (30 nm)/TPBI (40 nm)/Ca:Ag).

During autophagic activation, autophagosomes fuse with lysosomes to form autolysosomes where incorporated materials are degraded. However, the dynamics of autolysosomes in neurites of live cells was still poorly known. In this study, various subsets of microscope were applied to analyse the autophagy induction and highly dynamic transport of autolysosomes in rat PC12 neurites. Beading formation was found in degenerating PC12 neurites under phase contrast light microscope after serum deprivation. The monomeric red fluorescence protein-green fluorescence protein-light chain 3labelled autolysosomes accumulated throughout PC12 neurites after 18 h of serum deprivation as revealed by fluorescence microscope analysis. The single-membrane autolysosomes were also visualized in PC12 cells under transmission electron microscope. Moreover, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiment, which was conducted by confocal laser scanning microscope, demonstrated that autolysosomes were motile vesicles and moved along PC12 neurites during starvation. The directional transport of monomeric red fluorescence protein -labelled autolysosomes in neurites was further monitored by a motorized video microscope. Both anterograde and retrograde transport of autolysosomes were observed. In addition, the autolysosomes were precisely mapped by using 2D Gaussian fitting and then their highly dynamic movement was robustly tracked by using multidimensional assignment. Collectively, by using different microscopical techniques, our results confirmed the dynamic transport of autolysosomes in starved PC12 neurites and may provide valuable insight into understanding the biophysical characteristics of autolysosomes in neurites under physiological and pathological conditions.

Although several studies have evaluated the effects of MPH on human brain activation during specific cognitive tasks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), few studies have focused on spontaneous brain activity. In the current study, we investigated the effect of MPH on the intra-regional synchronization of spontaneous brain activity during the resting state in 18 normal adult males. A handedness questionnaire and the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale were applied before medication, and a resting-state fMRI scan was obtained 1 h after medication (20 mg MPH or placebo, order counterbalanced between participants). We demonstrated that: (1) there were no significant differences in the performance of behavioral tasks between the MPH and placebo groups; (2) the left middle and superior temporal gyri had stronger MPHrelated regional homogeneity (ReHo); and (3) the left lingual gyrus had weaker MPH-related ReHo. Our findings showed that the ReHo in some brain areas changes with MPH compared to placebo in normal adults, even though there are no behavioral differences. This method can be applied to patients with mental illness who may be treated with MPH, and be used to compare the difference between patients taking MPH and normal participants, to help reveal the mechanism of how MPH works.

They were cut into granules and divided into three parts (A = 0.4 g, B = 0.4 g, and C = 0.6 g). Part A was centrifuged after 0.075% collagenase digestion for isolation of the stromal vascular fraction (SVF). About 0.2 grams of SVF containing ASCs was obtained, and then incorporated with part B to create a treated group, whereas part C was treated as a control group. The tissues in both groups were randomly transplanted into a subcutaneous space that had been created on each side of the dorsal midline of the rabbit. The grafts were taken out after 3 months for calculation of the survival rates. The graft survival rate in the treated group was 23.56 +/- 2.49%, while that in the control group was 11.06 +/- 2.10%. The graft survival rate in the treated group increased significantly, compared with in the control group (p < 0.01). Improved transplantation effects may be obtained by implanting the fat particles mixed with ASCs. It is suggested that this approach has the potential for becoming a new method of fat graft in clinical practice.

For the cases of known and unknown error variances, the two different empirical log-likelihood ratios for the parameter of interest are constructed. If the error variances are known, the empirical log-likelihood ratio is proved to be asymptotic chi-square distribution under the assumption that the errors are given by a sequence of stationary alpha-mixing random variables. Furthermore, if the error variances are unknown, we show that the proposed statistic is asymptotically standard chi-square distribution when the errors are independent. Simulations are carried out to assess the performance of the proposed method.

The full coding region of the gene (DnTR1) is 804 bp in length which encodes a putative peptide consisting of 268 amino acids. Phylogenetic analysis showed that DnTR1 was a novel member of the TR family and evolutionarily distant from those well-characterized subgroups of TRs, suggesting that DnTR1 may have distinct characteristics. Structural modeling found that DnTR1 had a similar electrostatic environment at the inner molecular surface of the substrate binding pocket with TRI encoded by Datura stramonium (DsTRI). Catalytic activity assay with recombinant protein demonstrated that DnTR1 was able to reduce tropinone, 3-quinuclidinone hydrochloride, and 4-methylcyclohexanone using NADPH as coenzyme. Gene expression profiling by qRT-PCR revealed that the DnTR1 transcript was expressed in all three vegetative organs (leaves, stems and roots) of D. nobile with the highest expression level in roots. The expression of DnTR1 mRNA was enhanced 9.5 times (P < 0.01) by treatment of methyl jasmonate at 24 h, but not affected by salicylic acid and sodium nitroprusside treatments, indicating that DnTR1 regulation may be involved in a jasmonate-dependent pathway.

Physiological and molecular responses of the loss-of-function Arabidopsis thaliana grf11 mutant to Fe supply were investigated. Genes involved in posttranscriptional regulation of FER-LIKE FE DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR (FIT) were also analyzed. In addition, the molecular link between the signaling molecule nitric oxide (NO) and Fe deficiency responses was further dissected. Our results suggest that GRF11 is necessary for induction of Fe-deficiency-tolerance mechanisms. The FIT protein can bind to the promoter of GRF11, which contains an E-box motif. GRF11 also positively affects FIT transcription but has no influence on the genes involved in posttranscriptional regulation of FIT. Furthermore, NO positively regulates GRF11 induction upon the onset of Fe deficiency. We propose that, upon the onset of Fe deficiency, induction of FIT expression is dependent on GRF11, which acts downstream of NO to mediate Fe deficiency responses.

Recently, Chang and Lee proposed a new SSO scheme and claimed its security by providing well-organized security arguments. In this paper, however, we demonstrative that their scheme is actually insecure as it fails to meet credential privacy and soundness of authentication. Specifically, we present two impersonation attacks. The first attack allows a malicious service provider, who has successfully communicated with a legal user twice, to recover the user's credential and then to impersonate the user to access resources and services offered by other service providers. In another attack, an outsider without any credential may be able to enjoy network services freely by impersonating any legal user or a nonexistent user. We identify the flaws in their security arguments to explain why attacks are possible against their SSO scheme. Our attacks also apply to another SSO scheme proposed by Hsu and Chuang, which inspired the design of the Chang-Lee scheme. Moreover, by employing an efficient verifiable encryption of RSA signatures proposed by Ateniese, we propose an improvement for repairing the Chang-Lee scheme. We promote the formal study of the soundness of authentication as one open problem.

Different start-up strategies were evaluated in six upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors (R-1-R-6) for their effect on nitrogen removal performance. Maximal nitrogen removal rates (NRRs) greater than 20 kg N/m(3)/day were obtained in reactors R-3-R-5, which were seeded with mixed Anammox sludge previously stored for approximately 6 months and 1 month. A modified Boltzmann model describing the evolution of the NRR fit the experimental data well. An amount of sludge added to the UASB reactor or decreasing the loading rate proved effective in relieving the substrate inhibition and increasing the NRR. The modified Stover-Kincannon model fit the nitrogen removal data in the Anammox reactors well, and the simulation results showed that the Anammox process has great nitrogen removal potential. The observed inhibition in the Anammox reactors may have been caused by high levels of free ammonia. The sludge used to seed the reactors did not settle well; sludge flotation was observed even after the reactors were operated for a long time at a floating upward velocity (F-s) of greater than 100 m/h. The settling sludge, however, exhibited good settling properties. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the Anammox granules consisted mainly of spherical and elliptical bacteria with abundant filaments on their surface. Hollows in the granules were also present, which may have contributed to sludge floatation.

Paclitaxel-loaded nanoparticles based on salicylic acid-grafted chitosan oligosaccharide (COS/SA) were synthesized and characterized. Then, in order to understand the mechanism of the actions of the paclitaxel (PTX) encapsulated by COS/SA, all-atom molecular dynamics simulations were performed to analyze the aggregation of COS/SA molecules. The van der Waals and hydrophobic interactions are the major driving forces for the drug encapsulation process. Electrostatic and hydrogen-bonding interactions also play helpful roles in the COS/SA aggregation. Analyses of the radial distribution function and solvent accessible surface area indicate that the COS/SA nanoparticles are highly hydrosoluble and that the nanoparticles can significantly enhance the aqueous solubility of a hydrophobic drug. Different drug loading systems are also investigated in this work, and the best theoretical drug loading is found to be 10% (w/w). The present work provides insights into the mechanism of the atomic structures of drug-loaded polymeric nanoparticles and presents new perspective for the design of drug delivery systems with desirable properties.

Electrochemical realkalisation and combined corrosion inhibition of deeply carbonated historic reinforced concrete	CORROSION ENGINEERING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Steel reinforced concrete; Cyclic voltammetry; Repassivation	STEEL	The electrode reaction and the change in composition and morphology of the rust layer on rebar surfaces after electrochemical realkalisation treatment are investigated by electrochemical measurement and scanning electron microscopy. The results show that the rust layer is gradually reduced following the sequence Fe3+-> Fe2+-> Fe-0 through mechanisms postulated to involve proton exchange and dissolution-deposition. The realkalisation process can restore the alkalinity of the pore solution in carbonated concrete adjacent to cathodically polarised rebar and also reduce rust layers on rebar in severely carbonated concrete structures. However, though the alkalinity of pore solution is restored and the corrosion potential of the rebar in deeply carbonated concrete becomes more noble after cathodic polarisation, the rebar cannot repassivate while polarised. Thus, to assist in repassivation, additional inhibitor injection is proposed. The results demonstrate that the adjunction of inhibitor can limit the corrosion of the rebar. Therefore, the combination of inhibitor plus electrochemical treatment is likely to prolong the durability of deeply carbonated reinforced concrete structures.

We conducted in-depth interviews with 212 individuals, aged 18 to 39, in rural and urban areas of three provinces-Yunnan, Guizhou and Zhejiang-and have shown that while son preference has weakened considerably in this reproductive generation, it has by no means disappeared. The sex ratio remains high because of this small minority of individuals who still expresses a clear son preference and who choose sex-selective abortion to ensure male offspring. But its numbers are falling, and this may help to explain the recent downturn in sex ratio and perhaps signals the beginning of a trend towards its normalisation. Intensive local policy interventions have been successful in reducing the sex ratio in some areas and these should be disseminated widely.

Yet in China the sex ratio at birth has been the highest in the world for over two decades despite rapid modernisation, urbanisation and huge improvements in women's status. This study explored this apparent contradiction through interviews with 212 men and women in urban and rural areas of Zhejiang, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces. Results showed that women's status is perceived as high across a range of factors, including educational attainment and opportunity, labour participation and roles at home and the workplace. The majority of interviewees expressed gender indifference and had clear views about why the sex ratio is persistently high in China. High sex ratios persist probably because, while the majority is essentially gender indifferent, it takes only a small minority undergoing selective abortion to skew the sex ratio.

However, the molecular mechanisms by which telomerase provokes aging and cancer are far from being fully understood. In a search for proteins interacting with human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT by the yeast two-hybrid screen using hTERT T-motif as bait, we identified PP2A scaffolding subunit PR65 alpha isoform as an hTERT interacting partner. We showed that both PP2A catalytic subunit PP2AC and scaffolding subunit PR65 interacted with hTERT in vivo and in vitro and inhibited telomerase activity. In addition, we found that PP2A prevented the interaction of hTERT with 14-3-3? signaling protein, an hTERT binding partner that is required for nuclear localization of hTERT. Activation of PP2A by overexpression of PP2AC or PR65 led to cytoplasmic accumulation of hTERT, which was reversed by treatment with PP2A inhibitor okadaic acid. Together, these observations suggest that PP2A regulates hTERT subcellular localization, in addition to its inhibitory effects on telomerase activity. J. Cell. Biochem. 114: 409417, 2013.

Among the most distinctive characteristics of clonal plants is their potential for clonal integration (i.e. the translocation of resources between interconnected ramets), suggesting that integration may play a role in their success. However, a general synthesis of effects of clonal integration on plant performance is lacking. We conducted a meta-analysis on the effects of clonal integration on biomass production and asexual reproduction of the whole clone, the recipient part (i.e. the part of a clone that imports resources) and the donor part (i.e. the part of a clone that exports resources). The final dataset contained 389 effect sizes from 84 studies covering 57 taxa. Overall, clonal integration increased performance of recipient parts without decreasing that of donor parts, and thus increased performance of whole clones. Among the studies and taxa considered, the benefits of clonal integration did not differ between two types of experimental approaches, between stoloniferous and rhizomatous growth forms, between directions of resource translocation (from younger to older ramet or vice versa), or among types of translocated resources (water, nutrients and carbohydrates). Clonal taxa with larger benefits of integration on whole-clone performance were not more invasive globally, but taxa in which recipient parts in unfavorable patches benefited more from integration were. Our results demonstrate general performance benefits of clonal integration, at least in the short term, and suggest that clonal integration contributes to the success of clonal plants.

In this study, we investigated neural network modulations in persons in the preclinical stage of familial parkinsonism, and how the network interactions change at the clinical stage. Methods: We performed functional MRI in a family with SCA2 mutation, including 9 asymptomatic carriers and 10 mutation carriers with parkinsonian symptoms. Functional connectivity from the posterior putamen bilaterally and rostral supplementary motor area was used to explore network interactions in the subjects. Results: Both the asymptomatic carriers and patients had decreased connectivity within the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical motor loop compared to controls. The asymptomatic carriers showed extensively increased connectivity compared to controls, including the cortico-cortical motor, cortico-cerebellar, cortico-brainstem, and part of the basal ganglia-thalamus-cortical motor circuits. In contrast, the connectivity of most of these networks was decreased in the patients. These abnormalities were relatively normalized after levodopa administration. Conclusions: In the preclinical stage of SCA2 parkinsonism, the connectivity of a part of the basal ganglia motor loop is weakened as a consequence of dopaminergic deficits; meanwhile, the connectivity of other large-scale brain networks is strengthened presumably to compensate for the dysfunction of the basal ganglia to maintain brain function in the early stage of dopaminergic deficits. The simultaneous effects of progressive disruption of basal ganglia motor circuits and failure of compensatory mechanisms as dopaminergic dysfunction progresses may contribute to the onset of clinical symptoms.

In this review, we summarize the experimental evidence to support this association that has been noted in many epidemiologic studies. Inflammation in response to particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure in air pollution represents a common mechanism that may interact with other pro-inflammatory influences in diet and life style to modulate susceptibility to cardiometabolic diseases. The role of innate immune cytokines released from macrophages in the lung is well known. In addition, chemokine triggers in response to air-pollution exposure may mediate a cellular response from the bone marrow/spleen through toll-like receptors (TLRs) and Nucleotide Oligomerization Domain receptors (NLRs) pathways to mediate inflammatory response in organs. Emerging data also seem to support a role for PM2.5 exposure in endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis and in brown adipose tissue dysfunction. Decreased expression of UCP1 in brown adipose tissue may account for reduced thermogenesis providing another link between PM2.5 and insulin resistance. The implications of an experimental link between air-pollution exposure and type 2 DM are profound as air pollution is a pervasive risk factor throughout the world and even modest alleviation in exposure may provide substantial public health benefits.

The density and refractive index correlations for these systems were tested by an empirical second order polynomial and by the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. Excess molar volumes were calculated and correlated by the Redlich-Kister equation and the Legendre polynomials. The values of the volume expansivity (coefficient of thermal expansion) of pure chemicals and four binary solutions were estimated from temperature dependence of densities. Values of partial excess volumes at infinite dilution for these four binary systems at different temperatures were calculated either from the adjustable parameters of Redlich-Kister smoothing equation or the Legendre polynomials. The deviations in refractive index were calculated and correlated by the Redlich-Kister polynomial expansions. The molar refractions were calculated from the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. The deviations in molar refractions were calculated and correlated by the Redlich-Kister polynomial expansions. Factors affected these excess quantities were discussed. The results obtained indicate that the excess molar volumes, the deviations in refractive index and the deviations in molar reactions at each temperature are negative. The system {D-4(Vi)(1) + o-xylene(2)} exhibits the maximum negative deviations from ideality among these four systems, which is the result of multiple factors such as the partial interstitial accommodation effect, the steric hindrance, the size of molecule and the instantaneous dipole-induced dipole interactions.

These languages consist of characters, and are of very limited dictionary sizes. Extensive experiments show that: (i) The character frequency distribution follows a power law with exponent close to one, at which the corresponding Zipf's exponent diverges. Indeed, the character frequency decays exponentially in the Zipf's plot. (ii) The number of distinct characters grows with the text length in three stages: It grows linearly in the beginning, then turns to a logarithmical form, and eventually saturates. A theoretical model for writing process is proposed, which embodies the rich-get-richer mechanism and the effects of limited dictionary size. Experiments, simulations and analytical solutions agree well with each other. This work refines the understanding about Zipf's and Heaps' laws in human language systems.

BesIII Collaboration	Search for eta and eta ' invisible decays in J/psi -> phi eta and phi eta '	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SYSTEMS	Using a sample of (225.3 +/- 2.8) x 10(6) J/psi decays collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, searches for invisible decays of eta and eta ' in J/psi -> phi eta and phi eta ' are performed. Decays of phi -> K+K- are used to tag the eta and eta ' decays. No signals above background are found for the invisible decays, and upper limits at the 90% confidence level are determined to be 2.6 x 10(-4) for the ratio B(eta -> invisible)/B(eta ->gamma gamma) and 2.4 x 10(-2) for B(eta '-> invisible)/B(eta '->gamma gamma). These limits may be used to constrain light dark matter particles or spin-1 U bosons. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.012009	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J.

L. Chen, W. J. Chen & X. F. Jin, a new species of Rosaceae from central Zhejiang, China is described and illustrated. Micromorphological characters of the indumentum on young shoots, leaves, petioles and peduncles, including scanning electron microscope [SEM] images, are provided. This new species is morphologically similar to P. schneiderianae Koehne in having its young shoots, petioles and pedicels all densely villose, but differs in having bracts persistent, styles glabrous, stipules 8-9 mm long, stamens 28-30 of per flower, and drupes glabrous. The new species is also similar to P. discoidea (Yu & C. L. Li) Yu & C. L. Li ex Z. Wei & Y. B. Chang in having 2 or 3 flowers in an umbellate inflorescence, and bracts persistent and marginally glandular, but it differs in having young shoots and petioles densely covered with yellowish-brown villose trichomes; leaves rounded or slightly cordate at base, the mid-ribs and lateral veins abaxially densely covered with yellowish-brown villose trichomes; and hypanthium ca. 3 mm long, shorter than sepals. The atpB-rbcL and trnL-F intergenic chloroplast spacers are selected for identification of the new and its similar species.

Measurements of psi ' -> (p)over-barK(+)Sigma(0) and chi(cJ) -> (p)over-barK(+) Lambda	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi' mesons collectedwith the BESIII detector at the BEPCII e(+)e(-) collider and chi(cJ) mesons produced via radiative transitions from the psi', we report the first observation for psi' -> (p) over barK(+)Sigma(0) + c.c. (charge conjugate), as well as improved measurements for the chi(cJ) hyperon decays chi(cJ) -> (p) over barK(+) Lambda + c.c. The branching fractions are measured to be B(psi' -> (p) over barK(+) Sigma(0) + c.c) = (1.67 +/- 0.13 +/- 0.12) x 10(-5), B(chi(c0) -> (p) over barK(+) Lambda + c.c) = (13.2 +/- 0.3 +/- 1.0) x 10(-4), B(chi(c1) -> (p) over barK(+) Lambda + c.c) = (4.5 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.4) x 10(-4), and B(chi(c2) -> (p) over barK(+) Lambda + c.c) = (8.4 +/- 0.3 +/- 0.6) x 10(-4), where the first error is statistical, and the second is systematic. In the decay of chi(c0) -> (p) over barK(+) Lambda + c.c:, an anomalous enhancement near threshold is observed in the invariant mass distribution of (p) over bar Lambda + c.c:, which cannot be explained by phase space.

However, little is known about its location and function in the nervous system. The aim of the present study was to investigate the regional and cellular expression and functions of Nischarin in the adult rodent brain. As assessed by real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and immunostaining, we found that Nischarin was widely distributed throughout the brain, with a higher expression in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Double-labeling showed that Nischarin was expressed in neurons and was mainly located in the perinuclear region and F-actin-rich protrusions. The expression pattern of Nischarin in the brain was thought to be closely associated with its function. This was verified by our findings from cell migration assays that Nischarin regulated neuronal migration. These results provide a preliminary survey of the distribution of Nischarin in different regions and cell types in the rat brain. This might help to elucidate its physiological roles, and to evaluate its potential clinical implications.

Here, we employed high-throughput sequencing and degradome analysis to identify microRNAs and their targets using high-throughput sequencing in CMS and its maintainer fertile (MF) lines of Brassica juncea. Results: We identified 197 known and 78 new candidate microRNAs during reproductive development of B. juncea. A total of 47 differentially expressed microRNAs between CMS and its MF lines were discovered, according to their sequencing reads number. Different expression levels of selected microRNAs were confirmed by using real-time quantitative PCR between CMS and MF lines. Furthermore, we observed that the transcriptional patterns of these microRNAs could be mimicked by artificially inhibiting mitochondrial F1F0-ATPase activity and its function in MF line by using treatment with oligomycin. Targeted genes of the microRNAs were identified by high-throughput sequencing and degradome approaches, including auxin response factor, NAC (No Apical Meristem) domain transcription factor, GRAS family transcription factor, MYB transcription factor, squamosa promoter binding protein, AP2-type transcription factor, homeobox/homeobox-leucine zipper family and TCP family transcription factors, which were observed to be differentially expressed between CMS and MF. Conclusion: Taken together, from these findings we suggested microRNA might participate in the regulatory network of CMS by tuning fork in gene expressions in CMS B. juncea. The differential expression of miRNAs observed between CMS and MF lines suggested that biogenesis of miRNAs could be influenced in the CMS.

Effects of Trampling on Morphological and Mechanical Traits of Dryland Shrub Species Do Not Depend on Water Availability	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BEAN-PLANTS; GROWTH; VEGETATION; STRESS; RESISTANCE; THIGMOMORPHOGENESIS; HETEROGENEITY; AVOIDANCE; TOLERANCE; DIVERSITY	In semiarid drylands water shortage and trampling by large herbivores are two factors limiting plant growth and distribution. Trampling can strongly affect plant performance, but little is known about responses of morphological and mechanical traits of woody plants to trampling and their possible interaction with water availability. Seedlings of four shrubs (Caragana intermedia, Cynanchum komarovi, Hedysarum laeve and Hippophae rhamnoides) common in the semiarid Mu Us Sandland were grown at 4% and 10% soil water content and exposed to either simulated trampling or not. Growth, morphological and mechanical traits were measured. Trampling decreased vertical height and increased basal diameter and stem resistance to bending and rupture (as indicated by the increased minimum bend and break force) in all species. Increasing water availability increased biomass, stem length, basal diameter, leaf thickness and rigidity of stems in all species except C. komarovii. However, there were no interactive effects of trampling and water content on any of these traits among species except for minimum bend force and the ratio between stem resistance to rupture and bending. Overall shrub species have a high degree of trampling resistance by morphological and mechanical modifications, and the effects of trampling do not depend on water availability. However, the increasing water availability can also affect trade-off between stem strength and flexibility caused by trampling, which differs among species. Water plays an important role not only in growth but also in trampling adaptation in drylands.

Stem cell factor (SCF) secreted by leukemic cells in Nalm6 B-ALL model was previously suggested to force normal HSCs/HPCs out of their bone marrow niches and allow leukemic cells to occupy the niches (Colmone A, et al. Science 2008). Here we found that stem cell factor (SCF) expression in PB and BM of T-ALL model was increased, but SCF mRNA and protein levels in normal hematopoietic cells were higher than those in leukemia cells, which suggested that upregulated SCF was mainly contributed by non-leukemic cells in response to the leukemia development. To further elucidate the molecular mechanisms, microarray analysis was conducted on normal HSCs in this model and verified by real-time RT-PCR. The expression of Hes1 and its downstream target p21 were elevated in normal HSCs, whereas their expression showed no significant alteration in HPCs. Interestingly, although overexpression of Hes1 by retroviral infection inhibited the in vitro colony formation of normal hematopoietic cells, in vivo results demonstrated that normal Lin(-) cells and HSPCs were better preserved when normal Lin(-) cells with Hes1 overexpression were co-transplanted with T-ALL leukemia cells. Our results suggested that the differential expression of Hes1 between HSCs and HPCs resulted in the distinct responses of these cells to the leukemic condition, and that overexpression of Hes1 could enhance normal HSPCs in the leukemic environment.

An airlift bioreactor fed with wastewater produced an appropriate NO2--N/NH4+-N mixture that could serve as an input for an anaerobic ammonium oxidation process. Moreover, the impact of transient overload, resulting in an increase in the ammonium concentration, on the stability of the PN process was also explored. Strict control of the pH, dissolved oxygen concentration, temperature, and ammonium concentration and load was adopted as the main combination operational strategy to maintain a stable partial nitrification process. A nitrite yield of up to 87.0% and an effluent NO2--N/NH4+-N ratio of 1.33, suitable for the influent of the subsequent ANAMMOX process, was observed. In addition, the capacity for ammonium conversion determined by increasing the influent NH4+-N concentration and reducing the hydraulic retention time were 1.2 and 1.83 g N/(L d), respectively. The shock experiment validated that this PN reactor has a good resistance to overload, even at a high concentration of substrate (1260 mg N/L), and that the performance of PN can be quickly restored after cessation of the shock.

R. nigromaculata were treated with 0, 0.1, 1, 10, and 100 nmol/L of MC-LR for 6 h. Results show that exposure to I nmol/L to 100 nmol/L of MC-LR decreased sperm motility and number of sperm cells and increased the sperm abnormality rate, whose values were significantly different from those of the control (P < 0.01). Moreover, the same dosage of MC-LR increased reactive oxygen species production and malondialdehyde content. At the same time, antioxidant enzyme (catalase and glutathione S-transferase) activity and glutathione reduced content rapidly increased, whereas antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase activity significantly decreased. These results imply that the defense system of the testes quickly responds to oxidative stress. Ultrastructural observation shows distention of the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi apparatus and changes in the mitochondrial matrix color, cristae number, and morphology. Moreover, using real-time PCR, increased relative expressions of P450 aromatase and SF-1 genes were observed. The results demonstrate for the first time that MC-LR could induce toxicity in the male reproductive system of R. nigromaculata. The findings in this research will provide more insights into the relationships between aquatic microcystins and amphibians. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Toward reliable characterization of functional homogeneity in the human brain: Preprocessing, scan duration, imaging resolution and computational space	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Connectome; Test-retest; Reliability; Functional homogeneity; Default network	RESTING-STATE FMRI; ABNORMAL NEURAL ACTIVITY; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; GLOBAL SIGNAL; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; HEAD MOTION; BASE-LINE; CONNECTIVITY	While researchers have extensively characterized functional connectivity between brain regions, the characterization of functional homogeneity within a region of the brain connectome is in early stages of development. Several functional homogeneity measures were proposed previously, among which regional homogeneity (ReHo) was most widely used as a measure to characterize functional homogeneity of resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) signals within a small region (Zang et al., 2004). Despite a burgeoning literature on ReHo in the field of neuroimaging brain disorders, its test-retest (TRT) reliability remains unestablished. Using two sets of public R-fMRI TRT data, we systematically evaluated the ReHo's TRT reliability and further investigated the various factors influencing its reliability and found: 1) nuisance (head motion, white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid) correction of R-fMRI time series can significantly improve the TRT reliability of ReHo while additional removal of global brain signal reduces its reliability, 2) spatial smoothing of R-fMRI time series artificially enhances ReHo intensity and influences its reliability, 3) surface-based R-fMRI computation largely improves the TRT reliability of ReHo, 4) a scan duration of 5 min can achieve reliable estimates of ReHo, and 5) fast sampling rates of R-fMRI dramatically increase the reliability of ReHo. Inspired by these findings and seeking a highly reliable approach to exploratory analysis of the human functional connectome, we established an R-fMRI pipeline to conduct ReHo computations in both 3-dimensions (volume) and 2-dimensions (surface).

The aim of this meta-analysis was to assess the diagnostic value of 18F-FDG PET/CT in detecting metastatic lesions in NSCLC patients. Meta-analysis methods were used to pool sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likehood ratios, diagnostic odd ratios and to construct a summary receiver-operating characteristic curve. Data from included studies were pooled to compare the diagnostic accuracy between PET/CT and PET or CT alone in nodal staging. Totally, 56 studies involving 8,699 patients met the inclusion criteria. The pooled sensitivities and specificities of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 0.72 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.650.78] and 0.91 (95% CI: 0.860.94) in determining mediastinal nodal staging; 0.71 (95% CI: 0.600.80) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.770.88) in intrathoracic staging; 0.78 (95% CI: 0.640.87) and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.840.94) in intrathoracic staging on a per-node basis. For detecting extrathoracic metastases, the pooled sensitivities and specificities of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 0.77 (95% CI: 0.470.93) and 0.95 (95% CI: 0.920.97) for all extrathoracic metastases; 0.91 (95% CI: 0.800.97) and 0.98 (95% CI: 0.940.99) for bone metastases. 18F-FDG PET/CT is beneficial in detecting lymph node metastases and extrathoracic metastases although PET/CT showed low sensitivity in detecting brain metastases. 18F-FDG PET/CT confers significantly higher sensitivity and specificity than contrast-enhanced CT (both p < 0.01) and higher sensitivity than 18F-FDG PET in staging NSCLC (p < 0.05).

Little is known about how the basal ganglia affect other brain system and is affected by other brain regions in HE. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the effective connectivity network associated with the basal ganglia is disturbed in HE patients by using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). Methodology/Principal Findings: Thirty five low-grade HE patients and thirty five age-and gender-matched healthy controls participated in the rs-fMRI scans. The effective connectivity networks associated with the globus pallidus, the primarily affected region within basal ganglia in HE, were characterized by using the Granger causality analysis and compared between HE patients and healthy controls. Pearson correlation analysis was performed between the abnormal effective connectivity and venous blood ammonia levels and neuropsychological performances of all HE patients. Compared with the healthy controls, patients with low-grade HE demonstrated mutually decreased influence between the globus pallidus and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), cuneus, bi-directionally increased influence between the globus pallidus and the precuneus, and either decreased or increased influence from and to the globus pallidus in many other frontal, temporal, parietal gyri, and cerebellum. Pearson correlation analyses revealed that the blood ammonia levels in HE patients negatively correlated with effective connectivity from the globus pallidus to ACC, and positively correlated with that from the globus pallidus to precuneus; and the number connectivity test scores in patients negatively correlated with the effective connectivity from the globus pallidus to ACC, and from superior frontal gyrus to globus pallidus.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of Two New N* Resonances in the Decay psi(3686) -> p(p)over-bar pi(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							PARTIAL-WAVE ANALYSIS; BARYONS; MODEL	Based on 106 x 10(6)psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII facility, a partial wave analysis of psi(3686) -> p (p) over bar pi(0) is performed. The branching fraction of this channel has been determined to be B psi(3686) -> p (p) over bar pi(0) = (1.65 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.15) x 10(-4). In this decay, 7 N* intermediate resonances are observed. Among these, two new resonances, N(2300) and N(2570) are significant, one 1/2(+) resonance with a mass of 2300(-30-0)(+40+109) MeV/c(2) and width of 340(-30-58)(+30+110) MeV/c(2), and one 5/2(-) resonance with a mass of 2570(-10-10)(+19+34) MeV/c(2) and width of 250(-24-21)(+14+69) MeV/c(.)(2) For the remaining 5 N* intermediate resonances [N(1440), N(1520), N(1535), N(1650) and N(1720)], the analysis yields mass and width values that are consistent with those from established resonances.

Superconducting transition with critical temperature T-c of 2.8 K, developed from a semiconducting-like normal state, was found in Sr0.5La0.5FBiS2. A strong diamagnetic signal and a clear specific-heat anomaly associated with this transition were observed, confirming bulk superconductivity. The upper critical field H-c2(0) was estimated to be 1 T by using the Ginzburg-Landau approach. Our experiments therefore demonstrate that bulk superconductivity can be achieved by electron doping in the SrFBiS2 system.

Sacc and its pharmacological function have a tranquilizing effect on the central nervous system. The aim of the study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Wuling capsule in treatment of insomnia. Materials and methods: We performed a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. The participants received either placebo (n=92) or Wuling capsule (n=94) for 4 weeks and a follow-up period for 2 weeks. Results: Compared between pre-treatment and post-treatment, the global Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) scores in both Wuling capsule group and placebo group improved significantly (P<0.01). However, there was no significant difference between Wuling capsule group and placebo group (P>0.05). Scores of clinical global impressions scale (CGI-I) at each week in Wuling capsule group was similar to those in placebo group (P>0.05). Compared between pre-treatment and post-treatment, scores of the four components of world health organization on quality of life brief scale (WHOQOL-BREF) in both Wuling capsule group and placebo group improved significantly (P<0.01). However, there were no difference between the two groups (P>0.05). The rate of adverse events was 10.10% in Wuling group, and 6.73% in placebo group (P>0.05). Conclusions: Wuling capsule can improve insomnia when compared with pre-treatment for 4 weeks and be a well tolerated by all the patients at the 6 weeks of study period. However, there are no significant in the results of the variables tested when compared with placebo control. Further additional rigorous randomized clinical trials are still required.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for hadronic transition chi(cJ) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-) and observation of chi(cJ) -> K(K)over-bar pi pi pi	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							STATES	Hadronic transitions of chi(cJ) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-) (J = 0, 1, 2) are searched for using a sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. The eta(c) is reconstructed with (KSK +/-)-K-0 pi(-/+) and K+K-pi(0) final states. No signals are observed in any of the three chi(cJ) states in either eta(c) decay mode. At the 90% confidence level, the upper limits are determined to be B(chi(c0) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-)) < 0.07%, B(chi(c1) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-)) < 0.32%, and B(chi(c2) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-)) < 0.54%. The upper limit of B(chi(c1) -> eta(c)pi(+)pi(-)) is lower than the existing theoretical prediction by almost an order of magnitude.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of eta(c) decay into Sigma(+)(Sigma)over-bar(-) and (sic)(-)((sic))over bar (+) final states	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							CHARMONIUM DECAYS	Using a data sample of 2.25 x 10(8) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector, we present the first observation of the decays of eta(c) mesons to Sigma(+)(Sigma) over bar (-) and (sic)(-)<((sic))over bar>(+) .The branching fractions are measured to be (2.11 +/- 0.28(stat) +/- 0.18(syst) +/- 0.50(PDG)) x 10(-3) and (0.89 +/- 0.16(stat) +/- 0.08(syst) +/- 0.21(PDG)) x 10(-3) for eta(c) -> Sigma(+)(Sigma) over bar (-) and (sic)(-)<((sic))over bar>(+) , respectively. These branching fractions provide important information on the helicity selection rule in charmonium- decay processes. DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.87.012003	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J.

Role of psychological intervention in fetoscopic laser surgery of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY			English	Article						Twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome; Laser; Psychological Intervention	THERAPY	Objective: This study aims to investigate the influence of application of psychological intervention in fetoscopic laser surgery of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS) on perinatal outcome. Materials and Methods: A total of ten cases of pregnant women diagnosed with TTTS from January 2007 to December 2009 in the present hospital were selected. Their gestational weeks ranged from 16 to 29 weeks. Under the location of B ultrasound, the method of intra-amitiotic fetoscopic laser occlusion of chorioangiopagous vessels (FLOC) plus amnioreduction was conducted for treatment. Contemporarily, psychological intervention was also carried out. Results: Preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative behavior controls of all pregnant women were good, and all operations were successfully completed to achieve the desired purpose of rehabilitation discharge. Conclusion: Fetoscopic laser surgery is an effective treatment for TTTS and competent psychological intervention is one of important measures for successful operation and pregnant woman rehabilitation discharge.

It turns out that this class of pointed Hopf algebras constructed by N. Andruskiewitsch and H.-J. Schneider contains many Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras. To give concrete examples of new Calabi-Yau Hopf algebras, we classify the Calabi-Yau pointed Hopf algebras U(D, lambda) of dimension less than 5.

The basic reproduction number R-0 is identified and global dynamics are completely determined by R-0. It shows that R-0 is a globally threshold parameter in the sense that if it is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; whereas if it is larger than one, there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is global asymptotically stable. For the proof of global stability with the disease-free equilibrium, we use the comparison principle; and for the endemic equilibrium we use the classical method of Lyapunov function and the graph-theoretic approach.

However, due to the complexity of ecosystems, it is not easy to find a perfect way to conclusively explain all the potential impacts. In this paper, by considering several important elements, we seek to build a dynamic network model to predict the Earth's health, trying to identify and explain how the human behavior and policies affect the model results. We firstly empirically analyze both the topological properties and time-dependent features of nodes and propose an Earth's health index based on Shannon Entropy. Secondly, we identify the importance of each element by a machine learning approach. Thirdly, we use a spreading model to predict the Earth's health. Finally, we integrate the topological property and the proposed health index to identify the influential nodes in the observed ecological network. Experimental results show that the oceans are the key nodes in affecting the Earth's health, and Big countries are also important nodes in influencing the Earth's health. In addition, the results suggest a possible solution that returning more living lands might be an effective way to solve the dilemma of ecological balance.

Method: After conventional culture and amplification of the laryngeal squamous carcinoma cell line Hep-2, CD 133+ cells were screened out with combination of isolated culture of stem cell microspheres and FACS for preparation of laryngeal cancer stem cells. After radiation treatment, miRNAs of laryngeal squamous carcinoma stem cells before and after radiation were enriched and purified. After microarray hybridization with mammalian miRNA and scanning of fluorescence signal, the miRNAs of laryngeal squamous carcinoma stem cells before and after radiation was subject to differential screening and clustering analysis. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was used to verify part of the differentially expressed miRNAs. Results: 70 miRNAs related to laryngeal cancer stem cell radiation with 2-fold difference in expression were screened out, in which 62 were down-regulated and 8 were up-regulated. Fluorescent quantitative RT-PCR results were consistent with miRNAs chip results. Conclusion: Some miRNAs may be involved in self-regulation with laryngeal squamous carcinoma stem cell radiation.

The fragment ion of sodiated N-benzylidenebenzenamine (P1) easily undergoes ion-molecule reactions with the residual ESI solvent molecules (H2O and CH3OH) in the vacuum system, as verified by MS3 and accurate MS analysis. The formed hydrated ions appear as an unusual leading peak in the profile spectrum, which results in a deviant decreasing mass shift of almost 1 Da. Density functional theory calculations indicate that P1 easily associates with H2O without any energy barrier. Thus, the hydrated P1 exists partially as a loose system of P1 and H2O, which provides a reasonable explanation for the decreasing mass shift of the solvated P1. The above results are important in obtaining structural information from MSn spectra and preventing erroneous data interpretation for the analogous adducts.

A series of 2-substituted benzimidazole derivatives were synthesized under mild conditions, with high yields (89-96%) and high selectivity. The blank and control experiments reveal that PPL plays an important catalytic role during the selective C-N bond formation process. The results demonstrate that PPL has a broad catalytic tolerance towards different aldehydes containing electron-donating or -withdrawing groups in this reaction. This study provides an efficient tool for the selective formation of C-N bonds in the synthesis of 2-substituted benzimidazole derivatives.

We acclimated hatchling soft-shelled turtles Pelodiseus sinensis under three thermal conditions (10, 20 and 30 degrees C) for 4 weeks, and then measured selected body temperature (T-set), critical thermal minimum (CTMin) and maximum (CTMax), and locomotor performance at different body temperatures. Thermal acclimation significantly affected thermal preference and resistance of P sinensis hatchlings. Hatchling turtles acclimated to 10 degrees C selected relatively lower body temperatures and were less resistant to high temperatures than those acclimated to 20 degrees C and 30 degrees C. The turtles' resistance to low temperatures increased with a decreasing acclimation temperature. The thermal resistance range (i.e. the difference between CTMax and CTMin, TRR) was widest in turtles acclimated to 20 degrees C, and narrowest in those acclimated to 10 degrees C. The locomotor performance of turtles was affected by both body temperature and acclimation temperature. Hatcliling turtles acclimated to relatively higher temperatures swam faster than did those acclimated to lower temperatures. Accordingly, hatchling turtles acclimated to a particular temperature may not enhance the performance at that temperature. Instead, hatchlings acclimated to relatively warm temperatures have a better performance, supporting the "hotter is better" hypothesis.

For the autonomous case, we give the attractive regions of equilibria and perform some numerical simulations. Basic demographic reproduction number R-d is obtained. Moreover, only the basic reproduction number R-0 cannot ensure the existence of the positive equilibrium, which needs additional condition R-d > R-1. For the nonautonomous case, by introducing the basic reproduction number defined by the spectral radius, we study the uniformpersistence and extinction of the disease. The results show that for the periodic system the basic reproduction number is more accurate than the average reproduction number.

We aim to evaluate the effects of Ulinastatin on inflammation, oxidation, and neuronal injury in the cerebral cortex after cardiopulmonary resuscitation. METHODS: Ventricular fibrillation was induced in 76 adult male Wistar rats for 6 min, after which cardiopulmonary resuscitation was initiated. After spontaneous circulation returned, the rats were split into two groups: the Ulinastatin 100,000 unit/kg group or the PBS-treated control group. Blood and cerebral cortex samples were obtained and compared at 2, 4, and 8 h after return of spontaneous circulation. The protein levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) were assayed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and mRNA levels were quantified via real-time polymerase chain reaction. Myeloperoxidase and Malondialdehyde were measured by spectrophotometry. The translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 was assayed by Western blot. The viable and apoptotic neurons were detected by Nissl and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). RESULTS: Ulinastatin treatment decreased plasma levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6, expression of mRNA, and Myeloperoxidase and Malondialdehyde in the cerebral cortex. In addition, Ulinastatin attenuated the translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 at 2, 4, and 8 hours after the return of spontaneous circulation. Ulinastatin increased the number of living neurons and decreased TUNEL-positive neuron numbers in the cortex at 72 h after the return of spontaneous circulation. CONCLUSIONS: Ulinastatin preserved neuronal survival and inhibited neuron apoptosis after the return of spontaneous circulation in Wistar rats via attenuation of the oxidative stress response and translocation of nuclear factor-kappa B p65 in the cortex. In addition, Ulinastatin decreased the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, Myeloperoxidase, and Malondialdehyde.

By using bifurcation analysis, the exact Turing domain is found in the parameters space. Furthermore, we obtain the amplitude equations and determine the stability of different patterns. In Turing space, it is found that predator-prey systems with Allee effect have rich dynamics. Our results indicate that predator mortality plays an important role in the pattern formation of populations. More specifically, as predator mortality rate increases, coexistence of spotted and stripe patterns, stripe patterns, spotted patterns, and spiral wave emerge successively. The results enrich the finding in the spatial predator-prey systems well.

Matrix solid phase dispersion (MSPD) and ion exchange coupled with mesoporous nanocarbon adsorption were adopted to pretreat solid and aqueous samples, respectively. The sensitivity was enhanced by about 9-fold due to the online stacking via field amplified sample injection. The conditions for CE separation and ECL detection were investigated in detail. The four beta(2)-agonists were baseline separated under the optimum conditions within 10 min. The linear ranges were 0.25-10.00 mu mol L-1 with detection limits (S/N = 3) of 0.081, 0.076 and 0.034 mu mol L-1 for CLB, TER and SAL, respectively, and 0.5-20.00 mu mol L-1 for PRO with a detection limit of 0.12 mu mol L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to determine the four b2-agonists in real samples, offering average recoveries ranging from 88.9% to 107.1% for pig feed, and from 86.7% to 109.1% for pig urine.

Ficus pandurata H. (Moraceae) is widely used in traditional Chinese medicine as a healthy food condiment or a medicine for treatment of various diseases including inflammation. Objective. The purpose of the present study is to investigate the phytochemical compositions and antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities of crude water (FPW) and ethanolic extracts (FPE) from Ficus pandurata H. Methods. Phytochemical compositions were identified by a high-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry method (HPLC-ESI-MS). The antioxidant activities were evaluated by diphenylpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and hydroxyl radical assays, and the anti-inflammatory activities were evaluated by paw edema and levels of inflammatory mediator TNF-alpha and PGE2 in monosodium urate (MSU) crystal-induced rats. Results. Six compounds were identified by HPLC-MS method, and abundance of phenolics was found in FPE. The FPE showed concentration-dependent-significant scavenging of DPPH and hydroxyl radicals with IC50 values 118.4 and 192.9 mu g/mL, respectively. The FPE treatment significantly inhibited the paw edema and the production of TNF-alpha and PGE2 in MSU crystal-induced rats. Conclusion. The FPE exerted stronger antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities which may be attributed to its high phenolic content.

In this study, concentrations of seven metals were determined in agricultural soils from Yuhang county, Zhejiang, China. Multivariate statistical approaches were used to study the variation of metals in soils during summer and winter seasons. Contamination of soils was evaluated on the basis of enrichment factor (EF), geoaccumulation index (I-geo), contamination factor (C-f), and degree of contamination (C-deg). Heavy metal concentrations were observed higher in winter as compared to summer season. Cr and Cd revealed random distribution with diverse correlations in both seasons. Principal component analysis and cluster analysis showed significant anthropogenic intrusions of Zn, Cd, Pb, Cr, and Cu in the soils. Enrichment factor revealed significant enrichment (EF > 5) of Zn, Cd, and Pb, whereas geoaccumulation index and contamination factor exhibited moderate to high contamination for Zn, Cr, Cd, and Pb. In light of the studied parameters, permissible limit to very high degree of contamination (C-deg > 16) was observed in both seasons.

Recently, Lou and Huang proposed a 3PAKE which is efficient and suitable for running on resource-constrained devices such as smart cards and mobile phones. In this paper, we show that their scheme is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack and partition attack. We then propose an efficient method to fix these problems. Additionally, the mutual authentication and session key secrecy of the proposed protocol are verified using a formal verification tool.

We carried out field and laboratory investigations to determine field body temperatures and thermal preference of this species. In the field, the body temperatures of the turtles conformed to the water temperature, with little diel variation in either summer or autumn. Over the diel cycle, the mean body temperatures ranged from 20.8 degrees C to 22.2 degrees C in summer and from 19.3 degrees C to 21.2 degrees C in autumn; the highest body temperatures ranged from 22.1 degrees C to 25.0 degrees C in summer and from 20.6 degrees C to 23.8 degrees C in autumn. In the laboratory, the preferred body temperature (T-p) was 25.3 degrees C. Food intake was maximized at 24.0 degrees C, whereas locomotor performance peaked at 30.0 degrees C. Consequently, T-p was closer to the thermal optimum for food intake than for locomotion. Therefore, this freshwater turtle has relative low field body temperatures corresponding to its thermal environment. In addition, the turtle prefers low temperatures and has a low optimal temperature for food intake	[Shen, Jianwei; Du, Weiguo] Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China; [Shen, Jianwei; Meng, Fanwei] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Life Sci, Dept Environm Sci, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yongpu] Wenzhou Univ, Coll Life & Environm Sci, Wenzhou 325027, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Du, WG (reprint author), Chinese Acad Sci, Inst Zool, Key Lab Anim Ecol & Conservat Biol, Beijing 100101, Peoples R China.	duweiguo@ioz.ac.cn			Chinese Academy of SciencesChinese Academy of Sciences [KSCX2-EW-Z-4]; One Hundred Talent ProgramChinese Academy of Sciences	We thank L.

The cultivar and environmental variations of total arabinoxylan (TAX), water extractable arabinoxylan (WEAX) and endoxylanase activity (EA) were investigated using eight barley cultivars growing at seven locations with diverse environmental conditions. The results showed that both barley cultivar and location significantly affected the TAX, WEAX and EA levels, but the variations of TAX content and EA were mainly attributed to cultivar, while the impact of location on WEAX content was greater than that of cultivar. Correlation analysis indicated that TAX was significantly correlated to WUAX.

Furthermore, the majority of routing algorithms barely consider the problem of long distance communication between adjacent cluster heads that brings high energy consumption. Therefore, this paper proposes a new cross unequal clustering routing algorithm based on the EEUC algorithm. In order to solve the defects of EEUC algorithm, this algorithm calculating of competition radius takes the node's position and node's remaining energy into account to make the load of cluster heads more balanced. At the same time, cluster adjacent node is applied to transport data and reduce the energy-loss of cluster heads. Simulation experiments show that, compared with LEACH and EEUC, the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the energy-loss of cluster heads and balance the energy consumption among all nodes in the network and improve the network lifetime.

The mechanisms of phase evolution of NaGdF4 nanocrystals are discussed on the basis of IR spectra, viscosity, XRD and TEM data. The results indicate that the stresses developed during the thermal treatment process play an important role in the phase evolution, which provides an experimental evidence of pressure-induced disorder-to-order phase evolution during the crystallization process for the first time. It is also found that the excitation and emission spectra as well as the luminescence lifetimes of the Eu3+ ions in the oxyfluoride glass ceramic are sensitive to the crystal lattice of NaGdF4.

Raw MR-DWI data therefore usually must undergo substantial preprocessing prior to tensor estimation. This study proposes an approach for the reconstruction of DT fields from MR-DWI data that combines into a single step the regularization of raw MR-DWI data and the optimized estimation of DT fields. The approach uses locally weighted linear least squares (LWLLS) estimation to correlate information within the local neighborhood of each voxel. It incorporates into the linear least squares (LLS) framework a bilateral filter which assigns different weights to neighbor voxels according to their intensities and relative distance. This method efficiently smoothes the MR-DWI data and estimates optimal tensors simultaneously. The performance of the proposed method was compared to that of traditional LLS estimation of tensors using both simulated and real-world human MR-DWI data. Both the simulated and real-world datasets demonstrated that the proposed method greatly outperforms the conventional LLS method and that the simultaneous smoothing of MR-DWI data and tensor estimation performs as well as the separate and sequential execution of these procedures.

Chemotherapy combined with target therapy using antibodies against tumor cell membrane antigens may greatly increase the survival of cancer patients. Similar to autoantigens in autoimmunity diseases, certain membrane components may be more heterogeneous and create new determinants of antigens or haptens after chemotherapy. The aim of the current study was to prepare anti-membrane antibodies against colon carcinoma cells undergoing chemotherapy and examine their anticancer activities in vitro. Methods. After the colon carcinoma cells were treated by mimic chemotherapy, the synthesized poly-lysine was used as a carrier to link the membrane antigen or hapten with the covalent bond of carbodiimide bridging. It was affirmed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting under laser confocal microscopy that the vaccine with poly-lysine membrane-linked cells with a covalent bond was successfully engineered. Then, the cognate mice were vaccinated, and the anti-membrane polyclonal antibodies were prepared and validated for their activities. Results. The anti-membrane polyclonal antibodies were effectively induced and prepared. Folliculus lymphaticus were found significantly increased in vaccinated mice, and B lymphocyte proliferation was also intensively stimulated by vaccine and generating antibodies. The polyclonal antibodies, exhibiting minimal endotoxicity, displayed intensive sensitivity, high affinity and strong specificity. They also elicited apoptosis and necrosis for wild type colon carcinoma cells and offered synergistic effect to repress the chemotherapy-resistant tumor cells. Conclusions. The poly-lysine-linked membrane for colon carcinoma cells undergoing chemotherapy could produce the anti-membrane polyclonal antibodies (promising as novel antibody molecules for target therapy) and generate an effective immune attack on the surviving cancer cells.

We evaluated the locomotor costs of tail loss in a viviparous skink, Sphenomorphus indicus, and examined whether locomotor costs were related to changes in gait characteristics and metabolic rate. Of 24 field-captured adult males with original intact tails, 12 individuals were used as experimental animals, and the remaining 12 as controls. Locomotor performance and CO2 production were measured for the experimental skinks before and after tail removal; the same parameters were measured at the same time for the control skinks. Compared with tailed skinks, the mean locomotor speed and stamina of tailless skinks was reduced by approximately 26% and 17%, respectively. At any given speed, tailless skinks had a shorter stride length for hindlimbs (but not for forelimbs) and a greater stride frequency than did tailed skinks. In S. indicus, locomotor impairment may be a result of the reduced stride length, and energetic constraints on stride frequency. We found no significant change in standard metabolic rate after the skinks underwent tail removal, which may reflect a minor effect on energy expenditure for maintenance. Although the reduction in metabolically active tissue might cause a lower metabolic rate, tail regeneration counteracted such an effect because it was energetically expensive.

Satellite views of the seasonal and interannual variability of phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas over the past 14 yr (1998-2011)	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							CHANGJIANG YANGTZE-RIVER; 3 GORGES DAM; YELLOW SEA; CONTINENTAL-SHELF; CHLOROPHYLL-A; BOHAI SEA; CHEMICAL HYDROGRAPHY; MULTISENSOR APPROACH; PRIMARY PRODUCTIVITY; TEMPORAL VARIATION	The eastern China seas are some of the largest marginal seas in the world, where high primary productivity and phytoplankton blooms are often observed. However, little is known about their systematic variation of phytoplankton blooms on large spatial and long temporal scales due to the difficulty of monitoring bloom events by field measurement. In this study, we investigated the seasonal and interannual variability and long-term changes in phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas using a 14 yr (1998-2011) time series of satellite ocean colour data. To ensure a proper satellite dataset to figure out the bloom events, we validated and corrected the satellite-derived chlorophyll concentration (chl a) using extensive in situ datasets from two large cruises. The correlation coefficients between the satellite retrieval data and the in situ chl a on the logarithmic scale were 0.85 and 0.72 for the SeaWiFS and Aqua/MODIS data, respectively. Although satellites generally overestimate the chl a, especially in highly turbid waters, both the in situ and satellite data show that the overestimation of satellite-derived chl a has an upper limit value (10 mu g L-1), which can be used as a threshold for the identification of phytoplankton blooms to avoid the false blooms resulting from turbid waters. Taking 10 mu g L-1 as the threshold, we present the spatial-temporal variability of phytoplankton blooms in the eastern China seas over the past 14 yr. Most blooms occur in the Changjiang Estuary and along the coasts of Zhejiang, with a maximal frequency of 20% (about 73 days per year). The coasts of the northern Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea also have high-frequency blooms (up to 20 %). The blooms show significant seasonal variation, with most occurring in spring (April-June) and summer (July-September). The study also revealed a doubling in bloom intensity in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea during the past 14 yr. The nutrient supply in the eastern China seas might be a major controlling factor in bloom variation. The time series in situ nutrient datasets show that both the nitrate and phosphate concentrations increased more than twofold between 1998 and 2005 in the Yellow Sea. This might be the reason for the doubling of the bloom intensity index in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. In contrast, there has been no significant long-term increase or decrease in the Changjiang Estuary, which might be regulated by the Changjiang River discharge. These results offer a foundation for the study of the influence of phytoplankton blooms on the carbon flux estimation and biogeochemical processes in the eastern China seas.

Two distinct trehalases have been identified in insects: soluble trehalase (Treh1) and membrane-bound trehalase (Treh2), although there is currently no information on these genes in S. litura. To characterize the distribution and function of treh, cDNAs of Treh proteins were cloned from S. litura. SpoliTreh1 cDNA has an open reading frame of 1758 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 585 amino acids, with a predicted mass of approximately 67.07 kDa and an isoelectric point of 4.86. SpoliTreh2 cDNA has an open reading frame of 2325 nucleotides, encoding a protein of 645 amino acids, a mass of approximately 73.62 kDa, and an isoelectric point of 5.90. Northern blotting analysis revealed that SpoliTreh1 transcripts are in the midgut, fat body, tracheae, and epidermis, but not in the brain and Malpighian tubules of S. litura larvae, whereas SpoliTreh2 transcripts were found in all 6 tissues. SpoliTreh1 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body the pre-pupal stage, and SpoliTreh2 transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body of 3-day-old larvae of the 6th instar and during the 1st 6 days of the pupal stage, except the 2nd day. Both SpoliTreh1 and SpoliTreh2 were highly expressed in third-instar larvae.	[Zou, Q.; Wei, P.; Xu, Q.; Zheng, H. Z.; Tang, B.; Wang, S.

J	Meng, YJ; Shao, CG; Ma, XX; Wang, HZ				Meng, Yijun; Shao, Chaogang; Ma, Xiaoxia; Wang, Huizhong			Introns targeted by plant microRNAs: a possible novel mechanism of gene regulation	RICE			English	Article						Plant microRNA; Pre-mRNA (the precursor of messenger RNA); Intron; RDR (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase); DCL (Dicer-like); Phased small RNA; Degradome	SMALL RNA; PARALLEL ANALYSIS; MIRNA TARGETS; IDENTIFICATION; DEGRADOME; RESOURCE; DATABASE; BIOGENESIS; SERVER; ROLES	Background: In plant cells, most microRNAs (miRNAs) perform cleavages of target mature mRNAs in the cytoplasm. A recent report of a miRNA pathway involved in DNA methylation in the rice nucleus raises the possibility that plant miRNAs could cleave intron-containing pre-mRNAs (the precursor of messenger RNAs) located in the nucleus. Results: In this study, we searched for the miRNA binding sites present within the introns of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa) genes. All miRNA-intron interactions predicted to result in cleavages were validated by using the public degradome sequencing data. As a result, 40 miRNA-intron pairs involving 25 miRNAs in Arabidopsis and 1912 pairs involving 91 miRNAs in rice were identified. For several rice genes, not all transcription forms (alternative splicing variants) were under similar regulation by specific miRNAs. Certain transcripts could escape cleavages due to the absence of intronic miRNA binding sites within these sequences. In some instances, specific cleaved intron remnants could be converted to double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) by RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 2. These dsRNAs could then be processed into 21- and 24-nt phased sRNAs by the activity of Dicer-like 1 and 3, respectively. The resultant siRNAs have the potential to be incorporated into Argonaute (AGO)-associated silencing complexes and result in cleavages of target pre-mRNA sequences. Conclusions: A regulatory model, miRNA-targeting of intron-containing pre-mRNAs-phased sRNAs-targeting of mature mRNAs is proposed, which further expands the potential modes of action of plant miRNAs.

We found some new ground-state structures which had not been found before. These mixed species prefer to adopt three-dimensional (3D) structures starting from four atoms. All the ground-state structures for the Ni-Al clusters are different from those of the corresponding pure Al clusters with the same number of atoms except for three atoms. The Mulliken population analysis shows that some charges transfer from the Al atoms to the Ni atoms. NiAln (n = odd number) cations, Ni2Al6 neutral, Ni2Al1 and Ni3Al cations and anions, and Ni3Al5 anion have the magnetic moments of 2 mu(B). The magnetic moments of NiAl4 and NiAl6 cluster neutrals and cations are 2 mu(B) and 3 mu(B), respectively. All the other cluster neutrals and ions do not have any nontrivial magnetic moments. The 3d electrons in Ni atoms are mainly responsible for the magnetism of the mixed Ni-Al clusters.

The resulting latexes of the P(BA+St)/pigment nanocomposites were filmed in a PTFE mould or printed onto cotton fabric. The morphology of the P(BA+St)/pigment nanocomposites and the dispersion of pigment particles in the latex film and on the printed fabric surface, as well as the adhesion between pigment and adhesive film, were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), 3D digital microscope system (3D-POM), and printing results tests. Attributing to the preprotection of adhesive polymer shell, the self-adhesive P(BA+St)/pigment nanocomposites were homogeneously and firmly dispersed both in the thin latex film and in the adhesive layer on the fiber surface. As a result, the color strength, color fastness, and handle of the fabrics printed by the P(BA+St)/pigment nanocomposites latex were significantly improved, compared to the fabrics printed by the conventional pigment blended latex.

We found that just adding facile pre-drying treatment before the calcination step can sufficiently avoid the phase separation and prevent the particles from aggregation. Well dispersed pure phase CuFe2O4 supported on a mesoporous silica catalyst was thus synthesized by using copper and iron nitrates as the precursors and KIT-6 as the support. It was used as the catalyst for the asymmetric hydrosilylation of aryl ketone. The reaction yield and ee value can both reach 93%. The synthesized CuFe2O4 possesses superparamagnetic properties, which ensures it can be easily recycled by an external magnetic field for reuse. This synthesis strategy can also be applied to various bimetal oxides, including NiFe2O4, CuCr2O4, CoFe2O4, etc.	[Li, Bin; Li, Min; Yao, Chaohua; Shi, Yifeng; Ye, Danru; Wu, Jing] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Mat Chem & Chem Engn, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Dongyuan] Fudan Univ, Dept Chem, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China	Li, B (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Coll Mat Chem & Chem Engn, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.	yfshi@hznu.edu.cn; jingwubc@hznu.edu.cn	, 赵东元/E-5796-2010; Shi, Yusuf/A-7550-2008	, 赵东元/0000-0002-1642-2510; Shi, Yusuf/0000-0003-2299-1186	NSFCNational Natural Science Foundation of China [21103038, 21172049, 21032003, 91127010]; PCSIRTProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT 1231]; NCETProgram for New Century Excellent Talents in University (NCET) [NCET-12-1083, NCET-07-0250]; Zhejiang NSFC [Z13B030008]; Special Funds for key innovation team of Zhejiang Province [2010R50017]	This work was supported by funding from NSFC (21103038, 21172049, 21032003, 91127010), PCSIRT (IRT 1231), NCET (NCET-12-1083, NCET-07-0250), Zhejiang NSFC (Z13B030008), and the Special Funds for key innovation team of Zhejiang Province (2010R50017).		39	25	25	3	148	ROYAL SOC CHEMISTRY	CAMBRIDGE	THOMAS GRAHAM HOUSE, SCIENCE PARK, MILTON RD, CAMBRIDGE CB4 0WF, CAMBS, ENGLAND	2050-7488	2050-7496		J MATER CHEM A	J.

A Cyber-ITS Framework for Massive Traffic Data Analysis Using Cyber Infrastructure	SCIENTIFIC WORLD JOURNAL			English	Article							INTELLIGENT TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS	Traffic data is commonly collected from widely deployed sensors in urban areas. This brings up a new research topic, data-driven intelligent transportation systems (ITSs), which means to integrate heterogeneous traffic data from different kinds of sensors and apply it for ITS applications. This research, taking into consideration the significant increase in the amount of traffic data and the complexity of data analysis, focuses mainly on the challenge of solving data-intensive and computation-intensive problems. As a solution to the problems, this paper proposes a Cyber-ITS framework to perform data analysis on Cyber Infrastructure (CI), by nature parallel-computing hardware and software systems, in the context of ITS. The techniques of the framework include data representation, domain decomposition, resource allocation, and parallel processing. All these techniques are based on data-driven and application-oriented models and are organized as a component-and-workflow-based model in order to achieve technical interoperability and data reusability. A case study of the Cyber-ITS framework is presented later based on a traffic state estimation application that uses the fusion of massive Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System (SCATS) data and GPS data. The results prove that the Cyber-ITS-based implementation can achieve a high accuracy rate of traffic state estimation and provide a significant computational speedup for the data fusion by parallel computing.

PEGylated chitosan, synthesized in three steps using mild reaction conditions, was used to modify the nanoparticles. Cyclosporin A-loaded, PEGylated chitosan-modified nanoparticles were prepared using an emulsification/solvent evaporation method. The drug content and encapsulation efficiency of the cyclosporin A-loaded, PEGylated chitosan-modified nanoparticles were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The average size of the nanoparticles was determined by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering. The pharmacokinetic behavior of the nanoparticles was investigated in rabbits after intravenous injection. Cyclosporin A concentrations in a whole blood sample were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography using tamoxifen as the internal standard. The pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the 3p87 software program. Results: Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance confirmed the structure of PEGylated chitosan. The drug content and encapsulation efficiency of the cyclosporin A-loaded, PEGylated chitosan-modified nanoparticles were 37.04% and 69.22%, respectively. The average size of the nanoparticles was 89.4 nm. The nanoparticles released 30% cyclosporin A-loaded in 48 hours in vitro, with no initial burst release. The mode of release in vitro was prone to bulk erosion. The in vivo results showed the biological half-life of the elimination phase (t(1/2 beta)) of the nanoparticles was 21 times longer than that of the cyclosporin A solution, and the area under the curve for the nanoparticles was 25.8 times greater than that of the cyclosporin A solution. Conclusion: Modification of PEGylated chitosan prolonged the retention time of the nanoparticles in the circulatory system and improved the bioavailability of cyclosporin A.

And a series of donor-acceptor-donor-type oligomers 3TTPD3T, 3TTPN3T, and 3TTIN3T, based on TPD, TPN and TIN, have been designed and synthesized for solution-processed small-molecule bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) solar cells. The impact of these different central acceptor moieties on their optical, electrochemical properties, morphology, and solar cell performance were studied. Optical and electrochemical data showed that structural modification of TPD exhibited a slight impact on the band gap and HOMO/LUMO energy levels. Atomic force microscopy and grazing incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering studies revealed that the central acceptors of these oligomers played an important role in determine the morphology of solid-state packing. Oligomer 3TTPD3T showed weak crystallinity in a thin film. The larger conjugation plane counterpart 3TTPN3T showed an improved structure order. Surprisingly, the structurally twisted compound 3TTIN3T showed a strong crystalline nature with large crystalline domains of several hundred nanometers. The photovoltaic properties of these oligomers were evaluated by fabricating BHJ devices with PC71BM. 3TTPD3T/PC71BM blends with a weight ratio of 2 : 1 showed a best power conversion efficiency of 1.87%, with a J(sc) of 4.93 mA cm(-2), a V-oc of 0.87 V, and a fill factor of 44%.

However, most planar pi-conjugated gelators are highly emissive in the solution state but become weak emitters when self-assembled. Recently, a novel phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission (AIE) has drawn increasing research interest and has been the subject of numerous investigations. This intriguing finding paves a new way for creating fluorescent organogels by utilizing gelators with AIE characteristics. This review focuses on the recent advances in fluorescent organogels with gelation-enhanced emission features. Various kinds of low molecular weight gelators consisting of typical AIE luminogens, conventional planar chromophores, and photoactive molecules are introduced and the mechanisms for the emission enhancement are discussed.

J	Dong, YW; Cai, SM; Shang, MS				Dong Yu-Wei; Cai Shi-Min; Shang Ming-Sheng			Empirical study on scaling of human behaviors in e-commerce	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						scale law; DFA; long-range correlation; human dynamics	FOURIER-ANALYSIS; 1/F NOISE	The detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) method is used to analyze the human on-line activities in e-commerce. We comprehensively investigate the scale laws of browse and purchase behaviors, which have received little attention before. The time series of browse and purchase behaviors each obviously show a periodical character, and their probability density distributions each have a significant bimodal form. Based on the Fourier transform method, the power spectra of time series indicate that each of them obeys a stochastic process with a long-range self-similar feature (i.e., deviation far from the Poisson process). After identifying and filtering the influence of periodic trend based on power spectra, the detrended fluctuation analysis is used to study the scaling law of time series. Several interesting results can be found that their scaling behaviors on small and large scales show similar values that confirm the long-range correlations rooting in the time series of human on-line activities, and their average scaling exponent approximately equaling 1 suggests that the human online activity may be associated with a self-organized criticality. Although the empirical results are only the observed phenomena like those found in the Internet traffic and stock price fluctuation of financial market, we still think that they may provide an important insight to deeply understand the mechanism of human dynamic behaviors in e-commerce and predict their fluctuation trend for the potential business application.

The heterostructures were then used as the sensing electrode for the electrochemical detection of anticancer drugs O-6-benzylguanine (O(6)BG) and lung cancer cells. O(6)BG exhibited an irreversible diffusion-controlled electrochemical process with an oxidation peak clearly identified at +0.78 V. For lung cancer cells one oxidation peak was found at +1.1 V and two reduction peaks at +0.30, and +0.90 V. These voltammetric features disappeared when O(6)BG was added to the lung cancer cells, which was ascribed to the structural changes of the cell membranes caused by the anticancer drug. These results suggested that nano-p-n junction heterostructures based on TiO2 nanobelts might serve as promising candidates for biosensing applications of anticancer drugs and tumor cells that will be of significance in diagnostic medicine, cancer diagnosis and molecular biology research.

A potassium silyl anion and a fused tricyclic silane were isolated, respectively. These results indicate that a homocyclic silylene intermediate is generated in the reduction of dibromocyclopentasilane. The trimethylsilyl group is bulky enough to protect the silylene from dimerization, however, it is not a good protecting group for hindering the 1,2-silyl migration.

Venoms from the four snakes shared common antigenic components, and most venom components expressed antigenicity in the immunological reaction between venoms and antiserums. Antiserums cross-reacted with heterologous venoms. Homologous venom and antiserum expressed the highest reaction activity in all cross-reactions. Species-specific antibodies (SSAbs) were obtained from four antiserums by immunoaffinity chromatography: the whole antiserum against each species was gradually passed through a medium system coated with heterologous venoms, and the crossreacting components in antiserum were immunoabsorbed by the common antigens in heterologous venoms; the unbound components (i.e., SSAbs) were collected, and passed through Hitrap G protein column and concentrated. The SSAbs were found to have high specificity by western blot and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). A 6-well ELISA strip coated with SSAbs was used to assign a venom sample and blood and urine samples from the envenomed rats to a given snake species. Our detections could differentiate positive and negative samples, and identify venoms of a snake species in about 35 min. The ELISA strips developed in this study are clinically useful in rapid and reliable identification of venoms from the above four snake species. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that the incubation of BSA and PUFAs for 72 h led to the formation of high-molecular-weight proteins, lipofuscin-like fluorescent substances and protein carbonylation. The application of natural polyphenols (phloretin, epicatechin, quercetin and naringenin) was effective to interrupt these adverse impacts on proteins to various degrees. As natural polyphenols are known for their antioxidant activity for retarding lipid peroxidation, the correlation between their free radical scavenging capacity and inhibition of lipid peroxidation-induced BSA modification was further examined. A poor correlation was found, indicating polyphenols' antioxidative action was not the sole mechanism involved. Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that some alternative mechanisms such as reactive carbonyl species (RCS)-scavenging ability of phenolic compounds might work in concert to prevent lipid peroxidation-induced on proteins and human diseases.

The map-based cloning results showed that the mutant was due to a point mutation in the intron of OsDGL1 (LOC_Os07g10830), which encodes the dolichyl-diphosphooligosaccharide-protein glycosyltransferase 48 kDa subunit precursor. The mutation results in premature termination of protein synthesis. OsDGL1 is an ortholog of Arabidopsis DGL1, human OST48 and yeast WBP1, an essential protein subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, which is involved in N-glycosylation in eukaryotes. The leaky rice mutant, Osdgl1, displayed a change of matrix polysaccharides in its root cell wall, shorter root cell length, smaller root meristem and cell death in the root. Consistent with the known function of the OST complex in eukaryotes, the Osdgl1 mutation leads to a defect in N-glycosylation in the root. It was also found that reactive oxygen species (ROS) may be involved in this process.

J	Chen, XP; Cheng, HY; Xu, ZG; Yin, XF				Chen Xiao-Pan; Cheng He-Yong; Xu Zi-Gang; Yin Xue-Feng			A Low-cost Demountable Direct Injection High-Efficiency Nebulizer for Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry	CHINESE JOURNAL OF ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY			Chinese	Article						Demountable direct injection high-efficiency nebulizer; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry	ICP-MS; CAPILLARY-ELECTROPHORESIS; SPECIATION; SAMPLES; URINE	We developed a low-cost, demountable direct injection high. efficiency nebulizer (DIHEN) for inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). It consisted of an enlarged microconcentric nebulizer based body, a tapered capillary (0.25 mm i.d. and 0.37 mm o.d., 30 mu m i.d. and 40 mu m o.d. at the tip), a hollow stainless steel tubing (0.5 mm i.d. and 2.0 mm o.d.) and two adapters made from polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), which were assembled by epoxy resin. The tapered capillary was reproducibly fabricated according to a flame. heated two. step drawing method. After immerging into boiling water, the epoxy resin became soft and the components could be taken apart simply. Then the broken or blocked sample capillary was replaced by a new tapered capillary with the same dimensions and then they were assembled again. The optimal sensitivity was obtained when the gas flow rate was 0.27 L/min with a sample uptake rate of 50 mu L/min and a forward power of 1500 W. The sensitivities, detection limits and precisions of the homemade DIHEN under optimal operating conditions are similar, or better than those obtained with the MicroMist nebulizer, to some extent, though the polymeric ion levels of the former are higher than those of the latter. The utility of the homemade DIHEN for the analysis of small. volume samples was demonstrated by microscale flow injection analysis of Pt in serum samples. Then the homemade DIHEN was further utilized to couple microchip electrophoresis to ICP-MS for iodine speciation. The cost of the homebuilt DIHEN is about 1% price of the commercial Meinhard DIHEN, and the demountable construction permits that the blocked or broken sample capillary could be conveniently renewed with the same capillary in dimensions, obtaining low cost and easy maintenance.

Moreover, in Distributed Reflection DoS (DRDoS), attackers fool innocent servers (reflectors) into flushing packets to the victim. But most of current DRDoS detection mechanisms are associated with specific protocols and cannot be used for unknown protocols. It is found that because of being stimulated by the same attacking flow, the responsive flows from reflectors have inherent relations: the packet rate of one converged responsive flow may have linear relationships with another. Based on this observation, the Rank Correlation based Detection (RCD) algorithm is proposed. The preliminary simulations indicate that RCD can differentiate reflection flows from legitimate ones efficiently and effectively, thus can be used as a useable indicator for DRDoS.

A new methodology of cold damage risk assessment was built that apply to grid and have clear hazard-affected body. Each station cold damage annual frequency and average annual intensity of cold damage was calculated by using 1951-2010 station daily mean temperature and simple cold damage identification index. On this basis, average annual cold damage risk index was obtained by their product. The spatial analysis models of cold damage risk index about double-season early rice (DSER) and double-season later rice (DSLR) were established respectively by the relation of average annual cold damage risk index and its geographic factors. Critical threshold of level of average annual cold damage risk index for DSER and DSLR were respectively divided by the correlative equation of cold damage annual frequency and average annual intensity of cold damage. 2001-2010 planting area of DCR, acquired by time series analysis of MOD09A1 8-d composite land surface reflectance product, was as target of assessment. The results show average annual intensity of cold damage is exponential function of cold damage annual frequency, average annual cold damage risk index is directly proportional to cold damage cumulant and cold damage annual frequency, and is inversely proportional to happen times of cold damage and the square of statistical time sequence length. Cold damage risk of DSER is higher than DSLR in Hunan Province. In the 10-yr stacking map, DCR planting in low risk area accounted for 11.92% of total extraction area, in moderate risk area accounted for 69.62%, in high risk area accounted for 18.46%. According to the cold damage risk assessment result, DCR production can be guided to reduce cold damage losses.

However, one limitation of NDVI for drought monitoring is the apparent time lag between rainfall deficit and NDVI response. To better understand this relationship, time series NDVI (2000-2010) during the growing season in Sichuan Province and Chongqing City were analyzed. The vegetation condition index (VCI) was used to construct a new drought index, time-integrated vegetation condition index (TIVCI), and was then compared with meteorological drought indices-standardized precipitation index (SPI), a multiple-time scale meteorological-drought index based on precipitation, to examine the sensitivity on droughts. Our research findings indicate the followings: (1) farmland NDVI sensitivity to precipitation in study area has a time lag of 16-24 d, and it maximally responds to the temperature with a lag of about 16 d. (2) We applied the approach to Sichuan Province and Chongqing City for extreme drought monitoring in 2006 and 2003, and the results show that the monitoring results from TIVCI are closer to the published China agricultural statistical data than VCI. Compared to VCI, the best results from TIVCI3 were found with the relative errors of -4.5 and 6.36% in 2006 for drought affected area and drought disaster area respectively, and 5.11 and -5.95% in 2003. (3) Compared to VCI, TIVCI has better correlation with the SPI, which indicates the lag and cumulative effects of precipitation on vegetation. Our finding proved that TIVCI is an effective indicator of drought detection when the time lag effects between NDVI and climate factors are taken into consideration.

Good separations were obtained for EOC vs BOT, EOC vs healthy controls analyzed by partial least-squares discriminant analysis, or principal component analysis. Twenty-two ascertained metabolomic biomarkers were found to be disturbed in several metabolic pathways among EOC patients, including nucleotide metabolism (pseudouridine, N4-acetylcytidine), histidine metabolism (L-histidine, imidazol-5-yi-pyruvate), tryptophan metabolism (3-indolelactic acid), and mucin metabolism (3'-sialyllactose and 3-sialyl-N-acetyllactosamine). In addition, the concentrations of some urinary metabolites of 18 postoperative EOC patients among the 40 EOC patients changed significantly compared with those of their preoperative condition, and four of them suggested recovery tendency toward normal level after surgical operation, including N4-acetylcytidine, pseudouridine, urate-3-ribonucleoside, and succinic acid. These metabolites would be highly postulated to be associated with EOC. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that urinary metabolomics analysis by UPLC-QTOF/MS, performed in a minimally noninvasive and convenient manner, possessed great potential in biomarker discovery for EOC.

Its photophysical properties were studied by using UV, luminescence spectra, lifetime and quantum yield measurements. The complex Eu(DBM)(3)Aphen showed characteristic luminescence of europium ions under UV excitation. Compared with the complex Eu(DBM)(2)AA reported in the literature, complex Eu(DBM)(3)Aphen exhibited much stronger luminescence intensity, higher monochromaticity, longer lifetime and higher efficiency. The results showed that the complex Eu(DBM)(3)Aphen would be not only a potential red-emitting material but also a reactive complex, which would provide a new way for the synthesis of rare earth polymer with outstanding luminescence properties.

In this context, several parameters affecting MEEKC separation were studied, including the dispersion agents of MWNTs, MWNTs content, oil type, SDS concentration, and the type and concentration of cosurfactant. Compared with conventional MEEKC, the addition of all types of MWNTs dispersions using single or mixed cationic surfactant solutions in running buffers was especially useful for improving the separation of solutes tested, as they influenced the partitioning between the oil droplets and aqueous phase due to the exceptional electrical properties and large surface areas of MWNTs. Use of cationic surfactant-coated MWNTs (6.4 mu g/mL) as the additive in a microemulsion buffer (0.5% octanol, 2.8% SDS, 5.8% isopropanol, and 5 mM borate buffer) yielded complete resolution of 13 analytes. The proposed method has been successfully applied for the detection and quantification of the studied compounds in a complex matrix sample (Compound Xueshuantong capsule).

Therefore, in this study we examined whether resveratrol (3,5,4'-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene), a potent antioxidant and a putative activator of Sirtuin 1 (Sirt1), can ameliorate TBI-induced long-term BM injury by inhibiting radiation-induced chronic oxidative stress and senescence in HSCs. Our results showed that pretreatment with resveratrol not only protected mice from TBI-induced acute BM syndrome and lethality but also ameliorated TBI-induced long-term BM injury. The latter effect is probably attributable to resveratrol-mediated reduction of chronic oxidative stress in HSCs, because resveratrol treatment significantly inhibited TBI-induced increase in ROS production in HSCs and prevented mouse BM HSCs from TBI-induced senescence, leading to a significant improvement in HSC clonogenic function and long-term engraftment after transplantation. The inhibition of TBI-induced ROS production in HSCs is probably attributable to resveratrol-mediated downregulation of NOX4 expression and upregulation of Sirt1, superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), and glutathione peroxidase 1 expression. Furthermore, we showed that resveratrol increased Sirt1 deacetylase activity in BM hematopoietic cells; and Ex527, a potent Sirt1 inhibitor, can attenuate resveratrol-induced SOD2 expression and the radioprotective effect of resveratrol on HSCs. These findings demonstrate that resveratrol can protect HSCs from radiation at least in part via activation of Sirt1. Therefore, resveratrol has the potential to be used as an effective therapeutic agent to ameliorate TBI-induced long-term BM injury. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Accordingly, G-TPP shows a potential as a promising drug for the treatment of cancer. A cell can die from different types of cell death such as apoptosis, necrosis, necroptosis, and autophagic cell death. In this study, we further investigated the mechanisms and modes of cell death in the G-TPP-treated Hep3B and U937 cell lines. We discovered that G-TPP kills the U937 cells through the apoptotic pathway and the overexpression of Bcl-2 significantly inhibits U937 cell death to G-TPP. We further discovered that G-TPP kills the Hep3B cells by activating necroptosis in combination with the partial activation of caspase-dependent apoptosis. Importantly, G-TPP overcomes the apoptosis resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in Hep3B cells via necroptosis. We also observed that G-TPP induces compensatory autophagy in the Hep3B cell line. We further found that whereas there is a Bcl-2-Beclin 1 interaction in response to G-TPP, silencing the beclin 1 gene failed to block LC3-II accumulation in the Hep3B cells, indicating that G-TPP triggers Beclin 1-independent protective autophagy in Hep3B cells. Taken together, these data reveal that G-TPP induces cell death through a combination of death pathways, including necroptosis and apoptosis, and overcomes the apoptosis resistance conferred by Bcl-2 in Hep3B cells via necroptosis. These findings are important for the therapeutic exploitation of necroptosis as an alternative cell death program to bypass the resistance to apoptosis. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Based on small RNA (sRNA), RNA and degradome HTS data, the sRNAs specifically expressed at vegetative and reproductive stages were identified separately in rice. Two distinct groups of sRNA HTS data, which were prepared during the vegetative and the reproductive stages, were utilized to extract stage-specific sRNAs. Degradome sequencing data were employed for sRNA target validation. RNA sequencing data were used to construct expression-based, sRNA-mediated networks. As a result, 26 microRNAs and 413 sRNAs were specifically expressed at the vegetative stage, and 79 microRNAs and 539 sRNAs were specifically expressed at the reproductive stage. In addition to the microRNAs, numerous stage-specific sRNAs enriched in ARGONA-UTE1 showed great potential to perform cleavage-based repression on the targets. Several stage-specific sRNAs were indicated to result from the wobble effect of Dicer-like 1-mediated processing of microRNA precursors. The expression patterns of the sRNA targets, and the stage-specific cleavage signals strongly indicated the reliability of the constructed networks. A set of rice stage-specific sRNAs along with the regulatory cascades, which have great potential in regulating specific developmental stages, were provided for further investigation.

Among them, P5 was a polymer with TTF as pendants. Their TGA results exhibited their good thermal stability and their electrochemical and spectroscopic properties were investigated by CV, UV-Vis, and FL. The results indicated that there were intramolecular interactions between TTF group and polymer backbone as well as between the EDOT and arylene moieties. After doping with TCNQ, P5 could form stable CT-complex with a conductivity of 1.3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1), while its conductivity could be up to 3.5 x 10(-2) S cm(-1) after doping with I-2, due to its increased conductive dimensions. Such results indicated that this polymer had potential application in developing conducting materials. A kind of pi-conjugated EDOT-ethynylene-fluorene polymer with TTF as pendants was synthesized, which exhibited good solubility and thermal stability. When doping with I-2, its conductivity was improved significantly due to its increased conductive dimensions.

When the cysts enter diapause they are encased in a complex external shell that protects them from certain extreme environments. The genomic comparison of oviparous and ovoviviparous ovisacs has been described previously. We isolated three significantly up-regulated genes in oviparous oocytes and identified them as Arp-CBP (Anemia parthenogenetica chitin-binding protein) genes. Quantitative real-time PCR indicated that the expression of Arp-CBP genes gradually increases during diapause cyst formation and significant mRNA accumulation occurs during the ovisac stage of oviparous development. Moreover, in situ hybridization results demonstrated that Arp-CBP mRNAs are expressed in the embryo. Interestingly, the results of immune electron microscopy showed that all three Arp-CBPs are distributed throughout the cellular ECL (embryonic cuticle layer) of the cyst shell. Furthermore, knockdown of Arp-CBP by RNA interference resulted in marked changes in the composition of the embryonic cuticular layer. The fibrous layer of the cyst shell adopted a loose conformation and the inner and outer cuticular membranes exhibited marked irregularities when Arp-CBP expression was suppressed. Finally, an in vitro recombinant protein-binding assay showed that all three Arp-CBPs have carbohydrate-binding activities. These findings provide significant insight into the mechanisms by which the ECL of Artemia cyst shell is formed, and demonstrate that Arp-CBPs are involved in construction of the fibrous lattice and are required for formation of the ECL of the cyst shell.

However, the water reserve in the eggs may still influence their resistance to environmentally induced dehydration. We incubated rigid-shelled turtle eggs (Pelodiscus sinensis) on different moist substrates (from -12 to -750 kPa) to test the hypothesis that small rigid-shelled eggs would be sensitive to hydric environments. The hydric treatment significantly affected the incubation period, with eggs incubated in the moistest and driest substrates taking longer to hatch than those on the medium-moisture substrates. Hatching success was slightly lower for eggs incubated in dry conditions than those in wet conditions, but the difference was not statistically significant. The heart rates of early embryos were lower on moist substrates than those on dry substrates, but this difference disappeared in late embryos. Hatchlings from the moistest substrate were larger (in carapace length and width) and heavier than those from drier substrates. However, the dry body mass of the hatchlings did not differ among the hydric treatments. The functional performance (righting response) of the hatchlings was affected by the hydric environment. The time to right was shorter for the hatchlings from the substrate of -12 kPa than those from -220 kPa. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the hydric environment may significantly affect developing embryos and the resulting hatchlings in turtle species, such as P. sinensis, with small rigid-shelled eggs.

It was isolated and purified by high performance liquid chromatography, and subsequently hydrolyzed to yield water-soluble disodium salt form Gd@C-82[C(COONa)(2)] by the Hirsch reaction. The disodium salt was purified by dialysis. The resulting materials were characterized by various measurements, such as matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, ultraviolet-visible near-infrared and fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The aggregation behavior of the newly water-soluble nanoparticles was investigated by scanning electron microscopy and dynamic light scattering analysis. This presented synthetic methodology opens the avenue for the preparation of novel water-soluble malonate derivatives of paramagnetic Gd@C-82, which are expected to be useful species with potential applications in biomedicine.

The reactions of 10 with 4-XC6H4CH=NPh [X = H (11a), MeO (11b), and Cl (11c)] give the corresponding silaaziridines 12a-12c in high yields, which are thermally very stable and remain intact in the air and moisture for a long time. In contrast, the reactions of 10 with 4-F3CC6H4CH=NPh (11d) and 3,5-(F3C)(2)C6H3CH=NPh (11e) having strong electron-withdrawing aryl substituents on imine carbon are accompanied by 1,2-trimethylsilyl migration rather unexpectedly to give silaazetidines 13d-13e incorporated into a bicyclo[3.2.0]heptane ring. The reaction of 10 with N-benzylbenzaldimine 11f affords the corresponding (dibenzylamino)silane 14f in a moderate yield. Molecular structures of 12a-12c, 13d-13e and 14f were determined by X-ray crystallography. All these reactions are proposed to occur via the initial formation of the corresponding imine silaylides, while the subsequent reactions leading to the final products are controlled by the electronic structure of the ylide depending on the substituents.

A number of candidate gene regions have been suggested as possible barcodes for animals and plants, but for the identification of recently diverged species and/or varieties with only a few genetic differences it has been reported to be problematic in some cases. This study selected widely cultivated cruciferous vegetables as the primary samples, after failure of discrimination of each species using current DNA barcodes, we performed the fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (F-AFLP) and successfully discriminated each species, subspecies, variety and their cultivar in 74 samples. Then the non-qualitative results obtained from F-AFLP were transformed into two-dimensional barcodes image file of each cultivar via the PDF417 software. This method was also successfully applied to the discrimination of 17 Chinese indigenous pig breeds. The barcode we constructed which greatly reduces the information storage space is genotypes-specific, and can be conveniently decoded into the original data and thereby be conveniently shared and referred to. We believe that it is possible to construct a new data sharing molecular barcode system that could discriminate the subspecies, varieties, cultivars and even individuals with close genetic relationships.

The maximum wavelength of CL emission shifted from 431 to 595nm in the absence and presence, respectively, of phloxine B, suggesting that an efficient chemiluminescence resonance energy transfer occurred between a luminol donor and a phloxine B acceptor in the luminolhypochloritephloxine B system. Based on this observation, a simple, rapid and sensitive microflow injection CL method, using a microchip with spiral channel configurations, was developed for the determination of hypochlorite. Under optimized conditions, a linear calibration curve (R2=0.9944) over the range 0.110.0 mu mol/L was obtained, with a detection limit of 0.025 mu mol/L (S:N=3). The relative standard deviation (RSD) was found to be 4.2% (n=10) for 2.5 mu mol/L hypochlorite. The sample consumption was only 2 L, with a sample throughput of 90/h. The method has been used for determining trace amounts of hypochlorite in water samples with satisfactory results. Copyright (c) 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The isolation of LDs is crucial for carrying out morphological and biochemical studies of this organelle. In the past two decades, LDs have been isolated from several organisms and investigated by microscopy, proteomics and lipidomics. However, these studies need to be extended to more model organisms, as well as to more animal tissues. Thus, a standard method that can be easily applied to these new samples with the need for minimal optimization is essential. Here we provide an LD isolation protocol that is relatively simple and suitable for a wide range of tissues and organisms. On the basis of previous studies, this 7-h protocol can yield 15-100 mu g of protein-equivalent high-quality LDs that satisfy the requirements for current LD research in most organisms.
