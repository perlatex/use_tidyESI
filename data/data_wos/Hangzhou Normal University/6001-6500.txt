A total of 147 wild-captured adult females were divided into four groups according to their tail conditions. Tail breaks occurred most frequently in the proximal portion of the tail and least frequently in the distal portion, with the middle portion in between. This finding suggests that tail breaks occurring in nature often entails substantial energetic costs in E. chinensis where the tail is a major site of energy storage. The proportion of females that laid eggs was higher in females with intact or completely regenerated tails than in those with broken tails. Following whole-tail autotomy, the clutch size was reduced by 17%, and the clutch mass was reduced by 14%. Females undergoing substantial tail autotomy reduced reproductive investment, and they did so by reducing the number but not the size of eggs produced. None of the egg and hatchling traits was affected by tail loss. Comparing our data with those reported for other oviparous and viviparous skinks allows us to draw two general conclusions: one is that fecundity (clutch or litter size) is affected by tail loss in all species so far studied, whereas offspring size is affected by tail loss in some species, but not in others; the other is that the reduction in fecundity following tail loss is more evident in species lacking abdominal fat bodies [Current Zoology 58 (2): 228-235, 2012].

Melding the two units at the molecular level generates a group of new luminescent materials that suffer no ACQ effect but depict high solid-state fluorescence quantum yields up to unity, demonstrative of the uniqueness of the approach to solve the ACQ problem of traditional luminophores. All the TPE-carbazole adducts are thermally and morphologically stable, showing high glass-transition temperatures (up to 179 degrees C) and thermal-degradation temperatures (up to 554 degrees C). Multilayer electroluminescence devices with configurations of ITO/NPB/emitter/TPBi/Alq(3)/LiF/Al are constructed, which exhibit sky blue light in high luminance (up to 13 650 cd m(-2)) and high current and external quantum efficiencies (up to 3.8 cd A(-1), and 1.8%, respectively). The devices of the luminogens fabricated in the absence of NPB or hole-transporting layer show even higher efficiencies up to 6.3 cd A(-1) and 2.3%, thanks to the good hole-transporting property of the carbazole unit.

PLANAR GRATING MULTIPLEXERS USING SILICON NANOWIRE TECHNOLOGY: NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS AND FABRICATIONS	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							WAVE; SCATTERING; DEMULTIPLEXERS; DESIGN; LASER; MOM	Planar waveguide gratings have shown great potential for the application of the wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) functionality in optical communications due to their compactness and high spectral finesse. Planar gratings based on silicon nanowire technology have high light confinements and consequently very high integration density, which is 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than conventional silica based devices. In the present paper, we will simulate the silicon nanowire based planar grating multiplexer with total-internal-reflection facets using a boundary integral method. The polarization dependent characteristics of the device are analyzed. In addition, the planar grating multiplexer with 1 nm spacing is fabricated and characterized. Compared with measured values, the numerical results show that the sidewall roughness in the grating facets can result in a large insertion loss for the device.

Furthermore, some simulation results are presented to compare the performance of the proposed approach with those of existing approaches. It is found that the proposed approach and one of the existing approaches can maintain the nominal confidence level across a wide array of scenarios, and therefore are recommended to use in practical problems.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MRC1 gene may affect expression levels and differences in the structure and function of proteins in different individuals, thereby affecting individual susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis. However, to date, MRC1 polymorphisms associated with susceptibility to pulmonary tuberculosis have not yet been reported. The present study aimed to investigate potential associations of SNPs in the MRC1 gene with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Chinese population. Six SNPs (G1186A, G1195A, T1212C, C1221G, C1303T and C1323T) in exon 7 of the MRC1 gene were genotyped using the PCR and DNA sequencing methods in the pulmonary tuberculosis patients and the healthy controls. Linkage disequilibrium analysis was performed between polymorphic sites. The study found that the allele frequency of G1186A (rs34039386) of the MRC1 gene in a Chinese population was higher in the pulmonary tuberculosis group than the healthy control group. There was a significant difference in frequency distribution between the two groups (P = 0.037; OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.58-0.98). Genotypic analysis also indicated that the AG genotypes in a Chinese population were significantly correlated with pulmonary tuberculosis (P < 0.01; OR = 0.57; 95% CI, 0.37-0.87). After adjustment for age and gender, G1186A sites were found to be dominant (P < 0.01; OR = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.40-0.87), over-dominant (P = 0.045; OR = 0.69; 95% CI, 0.47-0.99) and additive models (P = 0.041; OR = 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59-0.99) in association with pulmonary tuberculosis. But, no association was found between the other 5 SNPs (G1195A, T1212C, C1221G, C1303T and C1323T) and tuberculosis (P > 0.05). This study is the first to report that genetic variants in the MRC1 gene can be associated with pulmonary tuberculosis in a Chinese population, and may reduce the risk of infecting pulmonary tuberculosis. This also provides a new experimental basis to clarify the pathogenesis of pulmonary tuberculosis.

It is proved that the sequence {x(n)} generated by the iterative method x(0) is an element of H, x(n+1) = alpha(n)gamma f(x(n)) + beta(n)x(n) + ((1 - beta(n))I - alpha(n)A)(1/s(n)) integral(sn)(0) T(s)x(n)ds, n >= 0 converges strongly to a common fixed point x* is an element of F(S), where F(S) denotes the common fixed point of the nonexpansive semigroup. The point x* solves the variational inequality <(gamma f - A)x*, x - x*> <= 0 for all x is an element of F(S).

J	Li, AN; Jiang, JG; Bian, JH; Deng, W				Li, Ainong; Jiang, Jingang; Bian, Jinhu; Deng, Wei			Combining the matter element model with the associated function of probability transformation for multi-source remote sensing data classification in mountainous regions	ISPRS JOURNAL OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Remote sensing; Classification; Matter element model; Associated function; Mountainous region	LAND-COVER CLASSIFICATION; SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINES; IMAGE CLASSIFICATION; ACCURACY; RIVER; ALGORITHMS; VEGETATION; DESIGN; FOREST; NORTH	That the multi-source remote sensing information integrates knowledge-based geospatial constraints to develop efficient and practical Land cover classification algorithm has become one of the most important developing directions in the field of remote sensing ground object classification. Remote sensing classification is a strictly incompatible problem, but the spectra distribution of remote sensing data has compatible attributes especially in mountainous regions, and such contradiction is one of the main reasons leading to uncertainties in remote sensing classification. In this paper, the remote sensing spectra feature compatible information is transformed into the probability of the association degree firstly, and then the matter-element theory is introduced to establish models to achieve the integrated classification of multi-source data to fuse knowledge-based geographical constrained condition probability. Taking the grass-land-wetland fragile ecosystem in Ruoergai plateau of China as a case study, this paper selected the multi-source data including images of Landsat TM and CBERS, ASTER-GDEM and MODIS-NDVI to construct a comprehensive classifier, in which the relationship between topography and land cover, and the prior knowledge on vegetation growth difference were taken as constraints to support the decision-making. The classification accuracy was evaluated by a field investigation and existing land cover map. The test result shows that, the overall accuracy (89.89%) and Kappa coefficient (0.8870) are better than those derived by the Maximum Likelihood method. It indicates that the proposed classification method is not subject to the dimensionality and form of data sources, and it can integrate the data source information to improve the classification accuracy, so that it is very useful to apply multi-source data and prior knowledge to land cover classification in mountainous regions.

The far field and the paraxial result are also presented as special cases, respectively. By using the derived formula, the nonparaxial propagation properties of a partially coherent AHB are studied numerically and are compared with the paraxial results. It is found that the nonparaxiality properties of a partially coherent AHB are closely related to its beam waist, coherent length and the propagation distance. (C) 2011 Elsevier GmbH.

SUBWAVELENGTH GUIDING OF TERAHERTZ RADIATION BY SHALLOWLY CORRUGATED METAL SURFACES	JOURNAL OF ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							PLASMON POLARITONS; METAMATERIALS; ENHANCEMENT; MODES; GAP	Surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) on metal surfaces corrugated periodically with shallow grooves are theoretically investigated in terahertz (THz) frequency range. Different geometrics of the grooves are analyzed, and it is found that SPPs on the surface with the trapeziform grooves have the best field confinement. The influence of the absorption of metal at THz frequencies on the performance of spoof SPPs is also examined. It is shown that long propagation length and subwavelength field confinement are simultaneously available for SPPs on the structured surface with trapeziform grooves. Metal surfaces with such a structure may lead to a new design of devices for routing terahertz radiations.	[Zhu, F. M.; Zhang, Y.

The TW-ZGNRs have comparable energetic stabilities to the normal ZGNRs and exhibit fascinating junction-dependent electronic properties. With the sp(2) hybridized junctions, the TW-ZGNRs undergo a Peierls distortion and behave as ferromagnetic metals. While the TW-ZGNRs with sp(3) hybridized junctions become semiconductors, which have a ferrimagnetic ground state. An external electric field can further modulate the band structures of semiconducting TW-ZGNRs. The parallel electric field directly moves the flat bands around the Fermi level, while the perpendicular field controls the edge states at the ribbon wings. By these electric field modulations, the band gaps are effectively tuned and half-metallicity can be induced into TW-ZGNRs. Our studies demonstrate that the junctions play an important role in the electronic structures of TW-ZGNRs, which have well-tunable electronic and magnetic properties for potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics.

Single-crystal X-ray results demonstrate that methyl-disubstituted PO-PTA forms a face-to-face dimer structure driven by pi-pi interactions. The investigations of optical properties showed that the oxidized phosphole moiety in this ladder system can effectively narrow the band gap. PO-PTA is a promising building block in pi-conjugated polymers and oligomers for optoelectronic applications. The derivative of PO-PTA, obtained by introducing four long alkyl chains, can self-assemble into one-dimensional (1D) fibers based on intermolecular pi-pi interactions, dipole-dipole interactions and van der Waals interactions. Interestingly, the uniform and well-ordered monolayers were also obtained for PO-PTA derivative on a HOPG (highly oriented pyrolytic graphite) surface.

Using extended Chebyshev polynomial over finite field Z(p), Algehawi and Samsudin presented recently an Identity Based Encryption (IBE) scheme. In this paper, we showed their proposal is not as secure as they claimed. More specifically, we presented a concrete attack on the scheme of Algehawi and Samsudin, which indicated the scheme cannot be consolidated as a real alternative of IBE schemes since one can exploit the semi group property (bilinearity) of extended Chebyshev polynomials over Z(p) to implement the attack without any difficulty.

The observed increases in ABA and puerarin were dependent on the concentration of ozone applied to P. thomsnii cell cultures. In order to examine the role of ABA in ozone-induced puerarin production, cell suspensions were pretreated with the ABA biosynthetic inhibitor fluridone. Following ozone exposure, fluridone treatment suppressed ABA accumulation suggesting ABA was normally synthesized de novo through the carotenoid pathway. Fluridone also blocked ozone-induced puerarin production, which could be reversed through application of exogenous ABA. However, in the absence of ozone, ABA itself had no effect on puerarin accumulation in the suspension cells. Taken together, the data indicate that ozone is an efficient elicitor of puerarin production and may be particularly applicable for improving puerarin production in plant cell cultures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that ABA is one factor associated with ozone-induced puerarin production in P. thomsnii cell cultures.

J	Xie, Q				Xie, Qi			A new authenticated key agreement for session initiation protocol	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						authentication protocol; key agreement; session initiation protocol; password guessing attacks; stolen-verifier attacks	PROVABLY SECURE AUTHENTICATION; SIP; SCHEME	The session initiation protocol (SIP) is an authentication protocol used in 3G mobile networks. In 2009, Tsai proposed an authenticated key agreement scheme as an enhancement to SIP. Yoon et al. later pointed out that the scheme of Tsai is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack, DenningSacco attack, and stolen-verifier attack and does not support perfect forward secrecy (PFS). Yoon et al. further proposed a new scheme with PFS. In this paper, we show that the scheme of Yoon et al. is still vulnerable to stolen-verifier attack and may also suffer from off-line password guessing attack. We then propose several countermeasures for solving these problems. In addition, we propose a new security-enhanced authentication scheme for SIP. Our scheme also maintains low computational complexity. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The hyphenated system was composed of a microchip, a demountable capillary microflow nebulizer (d-CMN) combined with a heated single pass spray chamber, a negative pressure sampling device, a high voltage power supply, a syringe pump and an ICP-MS. To eliminate the nebulizer suction generated by the pneumatic nebulizer and to ensure that the makeup solution flowed into the nebulizer, two porous polymer plugs were fabricated in the microchip. As a result, reasonably true electropherograms were obtained when compared to the CE separation performed in the traditional MCE-ICP-MS mode without porous polymer plugs. Electrophoretic separation of I I- and IO3- was achieved within 25 s in a microchip with an effective separation length of only 15 mm at an electric field of 857 V cm(-1) using 10 mmol L-1 borate (pH 9.2) as the running buffer. A resolution of 1.3 was obtained and the absolute detection limits for I- and IO3- were 0.12 and 0.13 fg, respectively. The precisions (RSD, n = 10) of the migration time and peak height for I- and IO3- were in the range of 1.1-1.6% and 2.5-2.8%, respectively. Two table salt samples were analyzed by an external calibration method. The iodate contents were in accordance with their labeled values.

The PES spectrum of the entire occupied valence band is reported, which exhibits abundant spectral features from the Fermi level to similar to 24 eV binding energy. All the spectral features are broadened as compared with the cases of C-60. The reasons for the broadening are analysed by comparing the experimental data with the calculated energy levels and density of states. Special attention is paid to the analysis of the C-60 highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO)-1 derived states, which can play a crucial role in the bonding at the interfaces of PCBM/polymer blenders or PCBM/electrodes. Besides the well-known energy level splitting of the C-60 backbone caused by the lowered symmetry, C 2p states from the side chain mix or hybridize with the molecular orbitals of parent C-60. The contribution of the O 2p states can substantially modify the PES spectrum.

However, the role of NO in ozone-induced secondary metabolite accumulation and the source of ozone-triggered NO generation are largely unknown. Here, we report that ozone exposure induces flavonol accumulation and NO generation of Ginkgo biloba cells. Pretreatment of the cells with NO specific scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide potassium (cPTIO) inhibits the ozone-induced flavonol production of the cells, showing that NO is essential for ozone-induced flavonol accumulation. Moreover, ozone exposure significantly enhances nitrate reductase (NR) activity of the cells. Application of NR inhibitors not only suppresses ozone-triggered NR activity but also inhibits ozone-induced NO generation, showing that ozone may induce NO generation dependently on NR activity. Furthermore, treatment of the cells with NR inhibitors suppresses the ozone-induced flavonol production and the suppression of NR inhibitors on ozone-induced flavonol production can be reversed by exogenous application of NO via its donor sodium nitroprusside (SNP). Together, our results suggest that the NR-mediated NO signaling is involved in ozone-induced flavonol production of G. biloba cells. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By analysis of 102 surface soil samples, high concentrations accompanied with long range of variation suggested anthropogenic sources for Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd. Further results of CART decision tree analysis showed that: (i) anthropogenic activities including industrial emission, vehicle-related activities, domestic emission and agricultural activities were the main sources for soil Cu, Zn, Pb. and Cd accumulation in the study area; and (ii) Soil organic matter and pH levels influenced the spatial distribution of soil heavy metals. By quantitatively comparing the importance of the independent parameters, we found that industrial emission was the most important source for soil Cu, Zn, Pb, and Cd content.

J	Jackson, SD; Hong, YG				Jackson, Stephen D.; Hong, Yiguo			Systemic movement of FT mRNA and a possible role in floral induction	FRONTIERS IN PLANT SCIENCE			English	Review						flowering locus T; FT; mRNA; flowering; tobacco		FLOWERING LOCUST (FT) protein is known to be part of the mobile flowering inducing "florigen" signal in plants, but it may not be acting alone. This article reviews the data that FT mRNA can also move systemically throughout the plant and into the shoot apical meristem (SAM) independently of the FT protein. There is a promotion of flowering when increased levels of virally expressed FT mRNA are present together with endogenously produced FT protein in inducing conditions, even if the additional FT mRNA is non-translatable and thus not increasing the overall levels of FT protein. A specific sequence, or "zip code" of the FT mRNA is required for systemic movement and this sequence binds a specific protein(s) in plant extracts. This raises the possibility the FT mRNA may be moving systemically through the plant and into the SAM as an RNA protein complex, whether FT protein is also a component of this mobile complex remains to be determined.

Increased Ceramide in Brains with Alzheimer's and Other Neurodegenerative Diseases	JOURNAL OF ALZHEIMERS DISEASE			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; ceramide; neurodegeneration; sphingolipid biosynthesis; sphingolipid regulation	TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE; SPHINGOLIPID METABOLISM; ACID SPHINGOMYELINASE; MAMMALIAN-CELLS; ROLES; QUANTIFICATION; APOPTOSIS; NEURONS	Ceramide has been suggested to participate in the neuronal cell death that leads to Alzheimer's disease (AD), but its role is not yet well-understood. We compared the levels of six ceramide subspecies, which differ in the length of their fatty acid moieties, in brains from patients who suffered from AD, other neuropathological disorders, or both. We found elevated levels of Cer16, Cer18, Cer20, and Cer24 in brains from patients with any of the tested neural defects. Moreover, ceramide levels were highest in patients with more than one neuropathologic abnormality. Interestingly, the range of values was higher among brains with neural defects than in controls, suggesting that the regulation of ceramide synthesis is normally under tight control, and that this tight control may be lost during neurodegeneration. These changes, however, did not alter the ratio between the tested ceramide species. To explore the mechanisms underlying this dysregulation, we evaluated the expression of four genes connected to ceramide metabolism: ASMase, NSMase 2, GALC, and UGCG. The patterns of gene expression were complex, but overall, ASMase, NSMase 2, and GALC were upregulated in specimens from patients with neuropathologic abnormalities in comparison with age-matched controls. Such findings suggest these genes as attractive candidates both for diagnostic purposes and for intervening in neurodegenerative processes.

In the microfluidic chip, the sample in the reservoir S automatically flew across the intersection P-1 to the reservoir SR under hydrodynamic pressure. Two porous polymer plugs C-1 and C-2 were created on the microchip to isolate electrokinetic flow from the pressure-driven flow. Once a high voltage between S and buffer reservoir B was applied, the sample was driven through the porous polymer plug C-1 into the metering channel by electrokinetic force. Simply changing the sampling time can freely optimize the sampling volume down to 0.18 nL, which was injected into the nebulizer by the pressure-driven makeup solution. The nanolitre sample introducing system has the advantages of low sample consumption, satisfactory precision, low sampling dead volume (0.38 nL) and low sampling dead time (0.42 s). The proposed system was successfully applied to determine platinum content in a serum sample of a cancer patient on cisplatin chemotherapy. The sample consumption of 1.8 nL was about 10(5) times less than that with the conventional sampling system. The sample throughput up to 112 h(-1) could be achieved with the detection limit of 64 ng L-1 for Pt-195. The content of Pt in the sample was 8.4 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1, agreeing well with that (8.5 +/- 0.3 mu g L-1) determined by the conventional sampling system.

These anomalies may be provided by geothermal natural convection through faults and partially influence the ground surface thermal environment. The study area in southern segment of Longmen Mountains thrust belt of Western Sichuan Basin contains complex faults and folds with recent earthquake activity. In order to study the faults for future oil exploration, we use LST data retrieved from Landsat thermal infrared band to detect the thermal information associated with faults. The LSTs are enhanced by filtering out anthropogenic activity and influence land cover classes, and interpolating to contour map. The spatial patterns of the enhanced images revealed the spatial correspondence between the thermal information and the dip planes of faults when compared with the explanation profiles and geologic features obtained from the 3D-seismic geophysical data. The thermal-affected ranges calculated and the statistically significant of regression model also indicate the result that the thermal information located near the faults are consistent with the faults' dip planes.

Deletion of p21 improved stem-cell function and organ maintenance in progeroid mice with dysfunctional telomeres, but the function of Pumahas not been investigated in this context. Here we show that deletion of Pumaim proves stem- and progenitor-cell function, organmaintenance and life span of telomere-dys function almice. Puma deletion impairs the clearance of stem and progenitor cells that have accumulated DNA damage as a consequence of critically short telomeres. However, further accumulation of DNA damagein these rescued progenitor cells lead stoin creasing activation of p21. RNA interference experiments show that upregulation of p21 limits prolife ration and evolution of chromosomal imbalances of Puma-deficients temand progenitor cells with dys function altelomeres. These results provide experimental evidence that p53-dependent apoptosis and cell-cyclearrest actin cooperating check points limiting tissue maintenance and evolution of chromosomalin stability at stem- and progenitor-cell levels inre sponse to telomeredys function. Selective inhibition of Puma-dependent apoptos is can resultin temporary improvement sinmaintenance of telomere-dys functional organ.

Treatment of 1 with Ni(PPh3)(2)Cl-2 and Pd(cod)Cl-2 gave [Ni(L1)Cl](PF6) (3) and [Pd(L1)Cl](PF6) (4), respectively, due to transmetalation. [Ni(L1)(2)](PF6)(2) (5) was obtained from the reaction of [Cu-3(L1)(3)(PF6)(3)] and Raney nickel in acetonitrile. All these complexes have been fully characterized. Both 1 and 2 consist of a triangular Cu-3 core with each Cu-Cu bond capped by an imidazolylidene group. Each imidazolylidene acts as a bridging ligand in a mu(2) mode and is bonded equally to two Cu(I) ions. The pincer nickel and palladium complexes are square-planar and contain a tridentate NCN ligand. Complexes 3 and 4 are efficient catalyst precursors for Kumada-Corriu and Suzuki-Miyaura coupling reactions of aryl halides with organometallic reagents. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, Y; Song, Y; Arp, HP				Liu, Yong; Song, Yu; Arp, Hans Peter			Examination of the relationship between urban form and urban eco-efficiency in china	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Urban form; Urban eco-efficiency; China	DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS; CITIES; METABOLISM; CITY; COMPACT; SYSTEM; TRAVEL; NOISE	The present study aims at exploring whether aspects of urban form are associated with urban eco-efficiency in China. Quantitative indicators relating to urban form (form, compactness ratio, elongation ratio and population density) and urban eco-efficiency (resource efficiency, environmental efficiency and overall eco-efficiency) were selected and quantified using remote sensing and data envelopment analysis methods. The urban form aspects of form and compactness ratios were positively correlated with urban eco-efficiency and resource efficiency. Conversely, the urban elongation ratio exhibited negative correlations with urban eco-efficiency and resource efficiency. Regarding environmental efficiency, no significant correlation is found with compactness though a negative correlation is found with population density. These results indicate that, within China, designing cities to be compact may be lead to increases in eco-efficiency and resource efficiency, but if the population density is too high the increased pollution costs will result in a decrease in environmental efficiency.

Several parameters affecting the separation were studied, including the choice of ILs, ILs-MWNTs concentration, the respective use of ILs and MWNTs, buffer pH, SDS concentration and borate content. Results revealed that the addition of ILs-MWNTs in running electrolytes enhanced the separation of target compounds compared to conventional micelle because the surface of carbon nanotubes interacted favorably with the analytes. Under the optimum conditions, a baseline separation was achieved for these analytes within 11 min in a 41.5 cm of effective length fused-silica capillary. At a voltage of 28.0 kV, the separation was carried out in a 10 mM borate buffer (pH 9.0) containing 100 mM SDS, 6% propanol and 4 mu g mL(-1) ILs-MWNTs. All calibration curves showed good linearity (r(2) >0.9990) within the test ranges. The intra- and inter-day precisions as determined from standard solutions were below 3.30% and 6.23%, respectively. The recoveries for ten compounds were found to range from 85.5 to 101.8%. The method was successfully applied for the determination of three types of compounds in Qishenyiqi dropping pills. Our experimental results indicated that the proposed method offered new opportunities for the analysis of complex samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The electronic structure, bond character and electron screening effects of interlayer H2O have been investigated by analyzing the atomic orbital populations, Mulliken charge population, Mulliken bonding population and density of state (DOS) using CASTEP (GGA/PBE) method. The results showed that both electrovalent bonds and covalent bonds have formed in host layer. The main part of interaction between host layer and interlayer guest was electrostatic interaction. While hydrogen bonding interaction dominated the interaction between guest anions and guest water molecules. The electron screening effects of interlayer H2O have an important influence on interlayer anions and layer bivalent metal ions. Electrovalent parts of host layer and covalent parts of interlayer increased with the number of interlayer water molecule.

The explicit expressions of the GMQD for the Dicke states and their superpositions are given. By comparing the GMQD with quantum discord, we conclude that they display similar behaviour. From the results, we know that most of the states we have considered exhibit pairwise quantum correlations.

They need to reprogramme host cellular machinery for DNA replication. This process is thought to be mediated by inactivation of cell-cycle repressor proteins and by induction of host DNA synthesis protein expression through actions of the feminviral replication initiator protein (Rep). Findings: Exploiting a Nicotiana benthamiana pOri2 line, which is transformed with a transgene consisting of a direct repeat of the African cassava mosaic virus (ACMV)-replication origin (Ori) flanking a non-viral DNA region, and virus-induced RNA silencing (VIGS), the impact of host gene expression on replication of the ACMV-derived replicon was investigated. The ACMV Rep trans-replicated the viral episomal replicon in leaves of young but not older pOri2 plants. Upon VIGS-mediated down-regulation of N. benthamiana NbRBR1, the retinoblastoma-related protein gene coding for a negative cell-cycle suppressor, recovered the ability of ACMV Rep for trans DNA replication, whereas the silencing of NbPCNA coding for the sliding clamp of DNA polymerase had no effect. Conclusions: These results suggest that the cellular machinery for DNA replication in differentiated tissues of older leaves cannot be reprogrammed by Rep alone but may need other uncharacterised viral and plant factors.

It was characterized by various techniques including H-1 NMR, COSY, NOESY, GPC, TGA, dynamic laser light scattering (DLS), UV-vis, and viscosity. Its molecular weight M-n was 64 kDa with polydispersity of 1.5 as determined by GPC, indicating that 45 repeating units existed in a single polymer chain. Its hydrodynamic diameter in a dilute acetonitrile solution was about 250 nm as determined by DLS. These studies not only proved the successful fabrication of the desired daisy chain polymeric structure but also provided a convenient method to construct linear mechanically interlocked polymers, avoiding the tedious syntheses of AB-type mechanically interlocked monomers.

Since the first report in 1947, a lot of literatures relating to hydrosilylation reaction have been published. This review summarizes the novel progress in the synthesis methods and application of heterogeneous catalysts for hydrosilylation in the last decade. A variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been prepared by using a series of carriers such as active carbon, silica and zeolite e. g. supported platinum, rhodium and gold catalyst, etc. The synthesis methods of organic and inorganic heterozygous carrier loaded transition metals as heterogeneous catalysts and application in the hydrosilylation are introduced emphatically. The catalytic performance of these catalysts and the catalytic mechanism are summarized and discussed. Some new types of polymers with functional groups have been synthesized and used to immobilize metals, those carving polymer particle catalysts always show interesting performance for hydrosilylation processes. Ionic liquid supported rhodium or ruthenium complexes as a new type of catalysts have been synthesized and applied in the hydrosilylation of alkenes or alkynes with excellent catalytic activity and selectivity as well as recycle performance. The development trend of supported catalysts for hydrosilylation reaction is also described.

Icariin is a flavonol extracted from several plant species of the Epimedium family. The icariin and its metabolic derivatives have been shown to exert wide protective effects in age-related diseases. However, whether icariin and its derivatives have the potency of delaying aging remains unclear. Here, we report that icariin and its derivative icariside II extend C. elegans lifespan. Using HPLC, we found high level of icariside II in the animals treated with icariin, suggesting icariside II is the bioactive form in vivo of icariin. Icariside II also increased the thermo and oxidative stress tolerance, slowed locomotion decline in late adulthood and delayed the onset of paralysis mediated by polyQ and A beta(1-42) proteotoxicity. The lifespan extension effect of icariside II is dependent on the insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS) since the daf-16(mu86) and daf-2(e1370) failed to show any lifespan extension upon icariside II treatment. Consistently, icariside II treatment upregulates the expression of DAF-16 targets in the wild-type. Moreover, our data suggests that the heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 has a role in icariside II-dependent lifespan extension further implicating the IIS pathway. In conclusion, we demonstrate a novel natural compound, icariside II as the bioactive form of icariin, extends the healthspan via IIS pathway in C. elegans.

Methods: Cells were incubated with different concentrations of BAC with or without the presence of 0.2% HA for 30 min. DNA damage to HCEs was examined by alkaline comet assay and by immunofluorescence microscopic detection of the phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci. ROS production was assessed by the fluorescent probe, 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). Cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V staining by flow cytometry. Results: HA significantly reduced BAC-induced DNA damage as indicated by the tail length (TL) and tail moment (TM) of alkaline comet assay and by gamma H2AX foci formation, respectively. Moreover, HA significantly decreased BAC-induced ROS increase and cell apoptosis. However, exposure to HA alone did not produce any significant change in DNA damage, ROS generation, or cell apoptosis. Conclusions: BAC could induce DNA damage and cell apoptosis in HCEs, probably through increasing oxidative stress. Furthermore, HA was an effective protective agent that had antioxidant properties and could decrease DNA damage and cell apoptosis induced by BAC.

We find that SOC will in general lead to zero temperature condensation of the Schwinger bosons with a single condensation momentum. As a consequence, the spin-spin correlation vanishes along the z axis but it develops in the x-y plane, with the ordering vector being dramatically dependent on SOC. Moreover, the phase boundary of the magnetic ordered state extends to the region of large spatial anisotropy with increasing condensation density, demonstrating that the spiral order is always stabilized by SOC.

Poly-beta-cyclodextrin (poly-beta-CD) was used as an additive in the running buffer to improve the separation of three analytes. The conditions for CE separation, ECL detection and effect of poly-beta-CD were investigated in detail. Under the optimal conditions, three kinds of herbicides (isoproturon, linuron and diuron) were well separated and detected within 8 min. The linear ranges of the standard solution for isoproturon and linuron were 1-300 mu g L-1 with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.1 mu g L-1, and for diuron was 2-500 mu g L-1 with a detection limit of 0.2 mu g L-1. The average recoveries were in the range of 86.9-102.8%, and all relative standard deviation of the migration time and the ECL intensity in intraday and interday were less than 9.0%. The proposed method was also applied to the determination of three kinds of herbicides in green vegetable and rice samples with recoveries in the range from 78.1 to 93.8%. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

A revised magnetism and superconductivity phase diagram is obtained via resistance and magnetic-susceptibility measurements for the FeTe1-xSex system. It is found that bulk superconductivity coexists with antiferromagnetic order in the crystals with 0.05 <= x <= 0.18. The phase diagram is very similar to the case of the K-doping or Co-doping BaFe2As2 as well as that of the SmFeAsO1-xFx system, perhaps indicating that all the iron-based systems have a generic phase diagram, although the antiferromagnetic wave vectors in the parent compounds of both iron pnictides and FeTe1-xSex systems are remarkably different.

We applied these methods to a diverse array of oviparous reptiles (24 species of lizards, 18 snakes, 11 turtles, 1 crocodilian), to identify general influences on cardiac rates during embryogenesis. Heart rates increased with ambient temperature in all lineages, but (at the same temperature) were faster in lizards and turtles than in snakes and crocodilians. We analysed these data within a phylogenetic framework. Embryonic heart rates were faster in species with smaller adult sizes, smaller egg sizes, and shorter incubation periods. Phylogenetic changes in heart rates were negatively correlated with concurrent changes in adult body mass and residual incubation period among the lizards, snakes (especially within pythons) and crocodilians. The total number of embryonic heart beats between oviposition and hatching was lower in squamates than in turtles or the crocodilian. Within squamates, embryonic iguanians and gekkonids required more heartbeats to complete development than did embryos of the other squamate families that we tested. These differences plausibly reflect phylogenetic divergence in the proportion of embryogenesis completed before versus after laying.

In this dark energy model, the energy density of dark energy is proportional to Hubble parameter and the proportional coefficient is of the order Lambda(3)(QCD), where Lambda QCD is the mass scale of QCD. The universe has a de Sitter phase at late time and begins to accelerate at redshift around z(acc) similar to 0.6. We fit this model and give the constraints on model parameters, with current observational data including Type Ia supernovea, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, big bang nucleosynthesis, and Hubble parameter data. We also study the cosmological evolution of the dark energy with interaction with cold dark matter.

The smallest reproductive female was 84 mm snout vent length (SVL). The largest female and male were 136 mm and 166 mm SVL, respectively. Sexual dimorphism in head size and tail size was evident in adults, with adult males having larger heads and longer tails than did adult females of the same SVL. Head size relative to SVL was greatest in hatchlings and smallest in adults, with juveniles in between. Tail length relative to SVL was shorter in hatchlings than in juveniles and adults but did not differ between juveniles and adults. Females produced a single clutch of 2-8 eggs per breeding season stretching from mid-April to mid-July. Clutch size, egg mass, and clutch mass were all positively related to female SVL. Egg mass was negatively correlated with clutch size when holding female SVL constant, and egg length was negatively correlated with egg width when holding egg mass constant. Larger females increased reproductive output primarily through production of more and larger eggs (and hence heavier clutches). Males are the larger sex in L. reevesii presumably because (1) the selective pressure toward increased male size is strong; (2) the selective pressure toward increased female size is comparatively low; and (3) somatic growth is more likely to be constrained by reproduction in smaller females because of a negative correlation between relative clutch mass and SVL.

FePO4 and doped Fe1-xCrxPO4 (x = 0.02, 0.04, 0.06 and 0.08) were prepared by homogeneous co-precipitation followed by spray drying method, and then the samples were sintered at different temperatures (380 degrees C, 460 degrees C, 550 degrees C and 650 degrees C). Physical-chemical properties were characterized by using thermogravimetric analysis (TG), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM); electrochemical behavior of the samples were analyzed using charge-discharge test, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results indicated that the Cr3+ doping can effectively improve the electrochemical performance of FePO4. Fe0.96Cr0.04PO4 sintered at 460 degrees C showed the highest specific capacity of 109.7 mAh/g for the 1st cycle at 0.05 C. In addition, the doping mechanism for FePO4 was discussed in this paper.

J	Chen, LZ				Chen Lizhen			Sexual Politics in the Separation of Social Space: The Ideological Traps behind Gender in North and South	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Review						sexual politics; public sphere; social space; Gaskell; North and South		Margaret Hale is a new woman that transgresses the separation of social space in North and South. She develops the gender power of women in the public sphere, saving both John Thornton's body and his career. Traced to the root, however, her salvation is propped up by the moral power of the conventional patriarchal society and the power of the drive for profit which is inherent in the nature of capital. Coupling the separation of social space with sexual politics, we can see the contradictions in Margaret's actions, which expose the ideological traps that are set before Victorian women charging toward the existing institutions.

The stereoselective formation of a selection of synthetically interesting beta-, gamma- or delta-halo alcohols bearing high degrees of enantiopurity (up to 99.9% enantiomeric excess (ee)) was realized with a substrate-to-ligand molar ratio (S/L) of up to 10 000. The present protocol also allowed the hydrosilylation of a diverse spectrum of alkyl aryl ketones with excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee) and exceedingly high turnover rates (up to 50 000 S/L molar ratio in 50 min reaction time) in air, under very mild conditions, which offers great opportunities for the preparation of various physiologically active targets. The synthetic utility of the chiral products obtained was highlighted by the efficient conversion of optically enriched beta-halo alcohols into the corresponding styrene oxide, beta-amino alcohol, and beta-azido alcohol, respectively.

In order to find an alternative for this specific nitro-containing organic solvent, the performance of some nitro-functionalized imidazolium salts such as 1-methyl-3-(4-nitrobenzyl)imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, 1-methyl-3-(4-nitrobenzyl)imidazolium tetrafluoroborate, 1-methyl-3-(4-nitrobenzyl)imidazolium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)amide and 1,2-dimethyl-3-(4- nitrobenzyl)imidazolium hexafluorophosphate, was examined in some reactions including trimethylsilylation of alcohols with hexamethyldisilazane, ring-opening reactions of 2-aryl-3,4-dihydropyrans with thiophenols or thiols, and a copper- mediated oxidative coupling of alkynes. As expected, these imidazolium salts can indeed replace nitromethane in these reactions. Particularly, the imidazolium salt along with the metal catalyst, if involved, can be easily recovered and reused without significant loss of activity. The use of these nitro-functionalized imidazolium salts as alternative solvents for nitromethane not only confers a green aspect to the reaction system, but also facilitates a rational design of a catalytic system with the concept of green chemistry.

Decreased Gray Matter Concentration and Local Synchronization of Spontaneous Activity in the Motor Cortex in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							ABNORMAL NEURAL ACTIVITY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; RESTING-STATE; REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; MDX MOUSE; MODEL; DISEASE; SCHIZOPHRENIA	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Patients with DMD have demonstrated functional abnormalities in the motor-related brain areas in previous PET, MRS, and TMS studies. We applied structural MR imaging and RS-fMRI in patients with DMD for the first time, and aimed to investigate the GMC and ReHo or local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the motor cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten boys with DMD (6.4-14.0 years of age) and 15 healthy controls (7.9-15.1 years of age) underwent brain structural MR imaging and RS-fMRI scanning. GMC and local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the motor cortex were analyzed by using VBM and ReHo approaches, respectively. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, boys with DMD showed decreased GMC in the left PSMC and decreased ReHo in the bilateral PMSC as well as in the supplementary motor area (P < .05, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that boys with DMD have both GMC loss and decreased local synchronization of spontaneous activity in the motor cortex, which might be due to the deficiency of dystrophin in the brain.

By use of the derived formulas the changes in the spectral density, the spectral degree of coherence, and the spectral degree of polarization of such a beam on propagation can be studied in detail. Numerical examples show that the statistical properties of the stochastic electromagnetic beam can be modulated by the Rabi frequency of the control light when the beam propagates through the EIT atomic vapor.

J	Xia, YJ; Kuang, L; Li, XM				Xia, Ying-jie; Kuang, Li; Li, Xiu-mei			Accelerating geospatial analysis on GPUs using CUDA	JOURNAL OF ZHEJIANG UNIVERSITY-SCIENCE C-COMPUTERS & ELECTRONICS			English	Article						General purpose GPU; CUDA; Geospatial analysis; Parallelization		Inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation and viewshed are two popular algorithms for geospatial analysis. IDW interpolation assigns geographical values to unknown spatial points using values from a usually scattered set of known points, and viewshed identifies the cells in a spatial raster that can be seen by observers. Although the implementations of both algorithms are available for different scales of input data, the computation for a large-scale domain requires a mass amount of cycles, which limits their usage. Due to the growing popularity of the graphics processing unit (GPU) for general purpose applications, we aim to accelerate geospatial analysis via a GPU based parallel computing approach. In this paper, we propose a generic methodological framework for geospatial analysis based on GPU and its programming model Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA), and explore how to map the inherent parallelism degrees of IDW interpolation and viewshed to the framework, which gives rise to a high computational throughput. The CUDA-based implementations of IDW interpolation and viewshed indicate that the architecture of GPU is suitable for parallelizing the algorithms of geospatial analysis. Experimental results show that the CUDA-based implementations running on GPU can lead to dataset dependent speedups in the range of 13-33-fold for IDW interpolation and 28-925-fold for viewshed analysis. Their computation time can be reduced by an order of magnitude compared to classical sequential versions, without losing the accuracy of interpolation and visibility judgment.

Here, we describe a test model that we have developed to evaluate the DNA-damaging effects of negatively charged nanoparticles of different sizes. We compared the DNA damaging effect induced by nanoparticles of various sizes and found that the effect is closely associated with the internalization pattern of the particles. Macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with carboxylated polystyrene beads (COOH-PBs) ranging in size from 30 to 500 nm. Size-dependent DNA damage was detected, and the lesion induced by two carboxylated fullerene particles confirmed this observation. Confocal microscopy revealed that the entry pathways of these COOH-PBs shifted from direct penetration to endocytosis with increasing particle size, followed by changes in subcellular localization. Subsequent deposition of 30-nm COOH-PBs in the cytosol led to a reduction of Zn2+ and Mg2+ content in the nucleus and an increased p53 level in the whole cell rather than in nucleus, while localization of 50- and 100-nm COOH-PBs in acidic vesicles induced p53 accumulation in both types of extracts. Based on these results, we assume that the damage resulted from a disruption of the balance between DNA damage and repair.

The structural, mechanical and viscoelastic properties of these composites were studied and compared. Wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD) studies indicated that the processing of nanocomposites did not change the original d-spacing of xGnPs. Scanning electron microscopy observation on the fracture surfaces of the composites shows a uniform dispersion of xGnPs throughout SEBS matrix and strong interfacial adhesion between oxidized xGnPs and the matrix, which are responsible for the considerable enhancement of mechanical properties of the composites. It is found that the addition of xGnPs particles improved both the elastic modulus and storage modulus of pure SEBS significantly and the higher the xGnPs content, the higher the modulus of the nanocomposite. Moreover, the effects of dispersed xGnPs on the microphase separation of SEBS have also been investigated using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Method: data collection involved semi-structured interviews, questionnaires and cross-comparison with hospital data. The data were analysed thematically. Setting: a university teaching hospital in a major city in eastern China. Participants: purposive sample of 30 women, five midwives and five medical staff who accessed, provided or liaised with the midwife-led service. Main outcome measures: participants' satisfaction, continuity of care/carers, choice and control. Findings: informants were positive about the unit, largely because the woman was supported by a midwife and a birth companion through the 'two-to-one' model of care. Discussion: the concept of 'two-to-one' care emerged as fundamental to women's experiences and utilisation of midwives' skills to promote normal birth. The high vaginal birth rate and the positive feelings reported suggest that this approach serves to empower women and promote physiological birth. Conclusion: women appreciated the midwife-led service, which provides an environment where they are more likely to aim to give birth without intervention. This model of care is good for its association with increased satisfaction in a context of extraordinarily high caesarean rates. Implications: midwife-led care can facilitate continuity of care and carer during birth. It offers women choice and control over many aspects of the birth. Further research is required to investigate factors important to women. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Objectives: To develop a novel HBV genotyping process using genotype specific loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Study design: HBV genotypes B and C specific LAMP methods were evaluated using standard panel. A comparative analysis of the LAMP test against Taqman assay using 105 clinical samples, was undertaken to evaluate the quantitation capacity of the method. 111 clinical samples were used to test the clinical applicability of the genotype specific LAMP method. The results were compared with those obtained by real-time PCR based genotyping and sequencing. Results: Using genotype-specific primers, the LAMP assay correctly identified all predefined genotypes B and C, and no cross-reaction was observed. Real-time format of this assay provides simultaneous identification and quantification of genotypes B and C. The detection sensitivity of the method was found to be 323 and 515 copies/ml for genotypes B and C specific LAMP assay respectively. High correlation (R-2 = 0.91) and good agreement between the LAMP method and the real-time PCR test were achieved for HBV quantitation. Samples from 111 HBV-infected patients were genotyped with LAMP, revealing 53% HBV as genotype B, 36% as genotype C, and 12% as mixed genotypes B and C. LAMP method showed coincidence rates of 96.7% with the real-time PCR genotyping results. Conclusion: This approach is a promising tool for HBV genotyping and quantitation. It appears to be useful for routine clinical practice even in field investigation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One important data source for such analysis is the alerts generated by intrusion detection systems (IDS) deployed over the network. However, IDS typically generates overwhelming amount of alerts, where one cannot simply aggregate or discard. In addition, the chance of a successful exploit depends on many hidden factors such as system status and attacker power, and thus the dependencies among exploits and conditions are typically too complicated to analyze under probability framework. In this paper, we employ expert system to deal with such uncertainties and conduct certainty factor inference. We show that analysis in fuzzy system is tractable and we propose an algorithm to analyze the network status and predict the potential attacks. Finally, we give a case study to illustrate our algorithm and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on the DARPA data sets. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The most important path for Cu accumulation in plants is uptake from soils. It is therefore important to understand the availability of soil Cu and its controlling factors to modify Cu availability and prevent excessive Cu from entering the food chain. The present study proposed a general regression neural network (GRNN) to simulate the availability index of soil Cu (available heavy mental concentrations/total heavy metal concentrations), based on the influencing factors of total Cu concentration, pH, organic matter (OM), available phosphorus (AP), and readily available potassium (RAK). Results showed that total Cu concentration, combined with OM and AP, achieved the lowest RMSE value (0.0524) for the modeled value of the availability index of soil Cu. The simulated results by GRNN and the ground truth values had better agreement (R (2) = 0.7760) than that by a linear model (R (2) = 0.6464) for 23 test samples. Moreover, GRNN obtained lower averaged relative errors than linear model. This demonstrated that GRNN could be used to simulate the availability index of soil heavy metals and gained better results than linear model.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for eta '(c) decays into vector meson pairs	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The processes eta'(c) -> rho(0)rho(0), K*0K*0, and phi phi are searched for using a sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi' events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. No signals are observed in any of the three final states. The upper limits on the decay branching fractions are determined to be B(eta'(c) -> rho(0)rho (0)) < 3.1 x 10(-3), B(eta'(c) -> K*0K*0) < 5.4 x 10(-3), and B(eta'(c) -> phi phi) < 2.0 x 10(-3) at the 90% confidence level. The upper limits are lower than the existing theoretical predictions.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; An, Z. H.; Bai, J. Z.; Berger, N.; Bian, J. M.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, S.

More attention is being paid to the health risk assessment of the enantioselective toxicity of BF isomers. In this study, we used rat ovarian granulosa cells as in vitro model to investigate effects of BF enantiomers on the biosynthesis of two hormones, progesterone and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), which are critical for mammalian reproduction. We showed that 1S-cis-BF, but not 1R-cis-BF significantly decreased the secretion of progesterone and PGE2 in granulosa cells. 1S-isomer of BF reduced the expression of genes P450scc, StAR, PBR and DBI, as well as COX-2, which are involved in regulating the rate-limiting steps of progesterone or PGE2 biosynthesis. The transcriptional activation of StAR and COX-2 promoter were disrupted by 1S-cis-BF. Furthermore, activity of protein kinase C (PKC), an important signaling mediator of progesterone and PGE2 synthesis, was differentially inhibited by 1S-cis-BF. The data of molecular docking revealed that one hydrogen bond was formed between 1S-cis-BF and PKC protein. In conclusion, we firstly reported in this study the enantioselective disrupting effects of BF isomers on progesterone and PGE2 synthesis via PKC pathway in rat ovarian cells. Our findings suggest that the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pesticides should be considered for evaluating mammalian reproductive health, a toxicologic endpoint of great concern in health risk assessment.

BESIII Collaboration	Higher-order multipole amplitude measurement in psi ' -> gamma chi(c2)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							TRANSITIONS; CHARMONIUM; STATES	Using 106 x 10(6) psi' events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, the higher-order multipole amplitudes in the radiative transition psi' -> gamma chi(c2) -> gamma pi(+)pi(-)/gamma K+K- are measured. A fit to the chi(c2) production and decay angular distributions yields M2 = 0.046 +/- 0.010 +/- 0.013 and E3 = 0.015 +/- 0.008 +/- 0.018, where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. Here M2 denotes the normalized magnetic quadrupole amplitude and E3 the normalized electric octupole amplitude. This measurement shows evidence for the existence of the M2 signal with 4.4 sigma statistical significance and is consistent with the charm quark having no anomalous magnetic moment.

Physiological and ecological characteristics of three rice genotypes with different tiller angle habits were compared in the paper. DI508, a genotype with changing tiller angle during the growth, has semi-erect tillers at early tillering stage, similar to genotype M09, and had erect tillers at late stage, similar to genotype 9308. In terms of dry biomass per plant, DI508 was consistently higher than those of M09 and 9308 throughout the growth. It was also a distinct difference of leaf area per plant that DI508 was larger than two others. From booting stage, DI508 and 9308 maintained higher photosynthetic ability of the topmost three leaves, while M09 showed rapid decline in photosynthesis during grain filling. It may be concluded that the genotype DI508 with dynamic tiller angle habit has a comprehensive advantage of fast growth and high weed competition at early stage and slow decline in photosynthesis at late stage.

In this paper we take the figure of merit (FoM) for Dark Energy Task Force fiducial model (Chevallier-Polarski-Linder model) to estimate goodness of different combinations of data sets, which include 11 widely used observational data sets (type Ia supernovae, observational hubble parameter, baryon acoustic oscillation, cosmic microwave background, x-ray cluster baryon mass fraction, and gamma-ray bursts). We analyze different combinations and make a comparison for two types of combinations based on two types of basic combinations, which are often adopted in the literature. We find two sets of combinations, which have a strong ability to constrain the dark energy parameters: one has the largest FoM, and the other contains less observational data with a relatively large FoM and a simple fitting procedure.

The recombinant DERA protein was purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 7.0 and 80 degrees C. For 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, the apparent K(m) was calculated to be 0.12 +/- 0.01 mM. No loss of activity was observed after incubation at 80 degrees C for 10 min. The enzyme was extremely stable over a wide range of pH levels. Moreover, the thermophilic enzyme also showed tolerance to acetaldehyde, which retained more than 70% activity after exposure for 4 h to 250 mM acetaldehyde at 25 degrees C.

When n = 1, (1.1) is the Aw Rascle traffic flow model. First, we introduce a new flux approximation to obtain a lower bound rho(epsilon,delta) >= delta > 0 for the parabolic system generated by adding "artificial viscosity" to the Aw-Rascle system. Then using the compensated compactness method with the help of L-1 estimate of w(epsilon,delta)(., t)(x) we prove the pointwise convergence of the viscosity solutions under the general conditions on the function P(rho), which includes prototype function P(rho) = 1/gamma rho(gamma) + A. where gamma is an element of (-1,0) boolean OR (0, infinity), A is a constant. Second, by means of BV estimates on the Riemann invariants and the compensated compactness method, we prove the global existence of bounded entropy weak solutions for the Cauchy problem of general nonsymmetric systems (1.1).

For this model, we drive the corresponding Kraus operators, obtain the analytic results of QD and compare the dynamics of QD with the dynamics of relative entropy of entanglement nearby the critical point. It is shown that the impact of the quantum criticality environment on QD can be concentrated in a very narrow region nearby the critical point, so it supplies an efficient way to detect the critical points. In the vicinity of the critical point, the evolution of QD is shown to be more complicated than that of entanglement. Furthermore, we find that separable states can also be used to reflect the quantum criticality of the environment.

In the PF scenario, while the resonant feature of the spin response at Q = (pi, pi) is preserved at weak PF, the feature is lost as the fluctuation is increased. The dispersion of the spin response in the PF scenario is simply a broadened version of the spectrum in the d-wave superconducting (DSC) state at all the strengths of PFs being discussed. In the DDW scenario, there is no spin resonant mode found at the AFM wave vector in nature, and the spin response exhibits the almost dispersionless feature markedly different from that in the PF scenario. As far as the spin dynamics in the pseudogap state is concerned, our results support the scenario that the pseudogap phenomenon is derived from a distinct normal-state order.

J	Sun, Z				Sun, Zhe			Spin squeezing under decoherence: Role of the quantum phase transition	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SUDDEN-DEATH	In order to witness multipartite correlations beyond pairwise entanglement, we study the spin-squeezing evolution of a spin-1/2 ensemble in environments with quantum phase transitions. Each spin half of the ensemble evolves under its own decoherence channel, which is modeled by a central spin 1/2 surrounded by a spin-1/2 XY chain. We employ four spin-squeezing parameters to describe squeezing, and their expressions at time t are analytically calculated for the spin ensemble in a collective initial state. It is found that spin squeezing of an auxiliary ensemble signals very well the critical regions of the environment. Quantum fluctuations of the environment accelerate the decay of spin squeezing and dramatically change spin squeezing.

We also show that the approach can be extended to thiazole, benzimidazole, and indole substrates. In addition, we present detailed mechanistic investigations on the Cu(I)-mediated direct thiolation reactions. Both computational studies and experimental results reveal that the copper thiolate complex [(L)Cu(SR)] (L: nitrogen-based bidentate ligand such as 2,2'-bipyridine; R: aryl or alkyl group) is the first reactive intermediate responsible for the observed organic transformation. Furthermore, our computational studies suggest a stepwise reaction mechanism based on a hydrogen atom abstraction pathway, which is more energetically feasible than many other possible pathways including beta-hydride elimination, single electron transfer, hydrogen atom transfer, oxidative addition/reductive elimination, and sigma-bond metathesis.

Preferred structures of the atomic Ag islands on silicone oil surfaces	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							THIN-FILMS; GROWTH; DIFFUSION	Varying the substrate temperature T-s from 285 to 353 K, both the aggregation behavior of Ag atoms and the preferred structures of the atomic Ag islands on silicone oil surfaces are investigated. After deposition, the deposited Ag atoms form isolated islands with a preferred height. Our observations reveal that, as T-s increases, the preferred island height increases from 20.0 to 33.0 nm, which results in the decrease of the Ag apparent coverage, from 9.6 +/- 0.1% to 6.5 +/- 0.3%. Further, the crystal structure of the Ag islands changes from amorphous to polycrystalline as the substrate temperature T-s goes up. Subsequently a 3D aggregation mechanism of the Ag atoms on the liquid substrates is proposed.	[Zhang, C. H.; Lv, N.; Zhang, X. F.; Yang, B.; Ye, G.

A series of oligo(p-phenylene ethynylene)s (OPEs) with different conjugated chain lengths as energy donor subunit in the energy-transfer system were capped at both ends with BODIPY chromophores as energy-acceptor subunits. The effect of the conjugated chain of OPEs on energy transfer in the OPEB cassettes was investigated by UV/Vis and fluorescence spectroscopy and modeling. With increasing number n of phenyl acetylene units (n=17), the absorption and emission maxima of OPEn are bathochromically shifted. In the OPEBn analogues, the absorption maximum assigned to the BODIPY moieties is independent of the length of the OPE spacer. However, the relative absorption intensity of the BODIPY band decreases when the number of phenyl acetylene units is increased. The emission spectra of OPEBn are dominated by a band peaking at 613 nm, corresponding to emission of the BODIPY moieties, regardless of whether excitation is at 420 or 550 nm. Furthermore, a very small band is observed with a maximum between 450 and 500 nm, and its intensity relative to that of the BODIPY emission increases with increasing n, that is, the excited state of OPE subunits is efficiently quenched in OPEBn by energy transfer to the BODIPY moieties. Energy transfer (ET) from OPEn to BODIPY in OPEBn is very efficient (all FET values are greater than 98?%) and only slightly decreases with increasing length of the OPE units. These results are supported by theoretical studies that show very high energy transfer efficiency (FET>75?%) from the OPE spacer to the BODIPY end-groups for chains with up to 1520 units.

However, knowledge on the regulatory activities of miRNA*s is limited. Although several studies pointed to the capacity of this small RNA species to repress target genes in animals, few related analyses were performed in plants. Here, we set out to uncover the repressive effects of miRNA*s on their targets in both Arabidopsis and rice. Systemic identification of miRNA*s was performed through secondary structure-based prediction and expression level-based verification. The targets of the miRNA*s were predicted and further filtered based on degradome sequencing data, resulting in comprehensive miRNA*-target lists with high reliability. Besides, comprehensive miRNA-target lists were also obtained. The phenomenon that one transcript was targeted by two or more miRNA(*)s was observed, which was defined as co-regulation. Finally, comprehensive miRNA- and miRNA*-mediated regulatory networks were constructed. Further investigation of some specific subnetworks implied the utility of these networks for biologists. This study could broaden the current understanding of miRNA-mediated regulation in plants.

ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article						Working memory; Prior entry; Attention; Awareness	TEMPORAL-ORDER JUDGMENTS; SEARCH; GUIDANCE; PERCEPTION; CAPTURE	Previous research has shown that content representations in working memory (WM) can bias attention in favor of matching stimuli in the scene. Using a visual prior-entry procedure, we here investigate whether such WM-driven attention shifts can speed up the conscious awareness of memory-matching relative to memory-mismatching stimuli. Participants were asked to hold a color cue in WM and to subsequently perform a temporal order judgment (TOJ) task by reporting either of two different-colored circles (presented to the left and right of fixation with a variable temporal interval) as having the first onset. One of the two TOJ circles could match the memory cue in color. We found that awareness of the temporal order of the circle onsets was not affected by the contents of WM, even when participants were explicitly informed that one of the TOJ circles would always match the WM contents. The null effect of WM on TOJs was not due to an inability of the memory-matching item to capture attention, since response times to the target in a follow-up experiment were improved when it appeared at the location of the memory-matching item. The present findings suggest that WM-driven attention shifts cannot accelerate phenomenal awareness of matching stimuli in the visual field.

This study investigates whether a negative attentional set, a form of top-down control, has an additional detrimental effect, and whether its influence is modulated by task demands. A negative attentional set was elicited through presentation of a pre-T1 distractor (D1), which belonged to the same category as T2. The presence of D1 impaired T2 performance, and this negative effect was generally larger inside than outside the AB. Moreover, this D1 effect remained constant or was augmented when the demand on T1 processing was enhanced. These findings demonstrate that a negative attentional set is maintained even though the central system is engaged in the in-depth processing of T1 during the AB.

The differential equation of motion for the higher-order Lagrange system is introduced. The definition of conformal invariance for the system together with its determining equations and conformal factor are provided. The necessary and sufficient condition that the system's conformal invariance would be Lie symmetry by the infinitesimal one-parameter point transformation group is deduced. The conserved quantity of the system is derived using the structural equation satisfied by the gauge function. An example of a higher-order mechanical system is offered to illustrate the application of the result.

Not all reproductive traits varied among the three populations. Of the traits examined, five (egg-laying date, post-oviposition body mass, clutch size, egg mass and egg width) differed among the three populations. The egg-laying date, ranging from late June to early August, varied among populations in a geographically continuous trend, with females at the most northern latitude (DH) laying eggs latest, and females at the most southern latitude (CZ) laying eggs earliest. Such a trend was less evident or even absent in the other traits that differed among the three populations. CZ and DH females, although separated by a distance of approximately 1100 km as the crow flies, were similar to each other in most traits examined. LS females were distinguished from CZ and DH females by the fact that they laid a greater number of eggs, but these were smaller. The egg size-number trade-off was evident in each of the three populations and, at a given level of relative fecundity, egg mass was significantly greater in the DH population than in the LS population.

Its Eu(III) complex with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) was prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, MS, and (1)H NMR spectra. The photophysical properties of the complex were studied in detail by using UV, luminescence spectra, luminescence lifetime and quantum yield. The complex shows a remarkable luminescence quantum yield at room temperature (40.1%) upon ligand excitation and a long (5)D(0) lifetime (590 mu s). which makes it not only a promising light-conversion molecular device but also an excellent luminescent polymer precursor.

Several recent studies suggested that a small number of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) can also be generated in the dorsal spinal cord. However, it is not clear whether these dorsal oligodendrocyte precursor cells participate in myelination and remyelination. To investigate the fate and potential function of these dorsally-derived oligodendrocytes (dOLs) in the adult spinal cord, Cre-lox genetic fate mapping in transgenic mice was employed. We used the Pax3(Cre) knock-in mouse to drive Cre expression in the entire dorsal epithelium and the Rosa26-lacZ or Z/EG reporter line to trace their spatial distribution and population dynamics in the spinal cord. The dorsal OPCs generated from the Pax3-expressing domains migrate into all regions of spinal cord and subsequently undergo terminal differentiation and axonal myelination. In response to a focal demyelination injury, a large number of newly differentiated oligodendrocytes originated from dOLs, suggesting that dOLs may provide an important source of OPCs for axonal remyelination in multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury.

HCEs were treated with BAC in concentrations ranging from 0.00005% to 0.001% for 30 min. Cells were examined immediately after BAC exposure and after 24-h recovery. Alkaline comet assay was used to detect DNA single-strand breaks (SSBs). Immunofluorescence microscope detection of the phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci indicated DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). Cell viability was measured by the MTT test. A significant increase of SSBs, detected by alkaline comet assay, was observed in a dose-dependent manner with BAC exposure in HCEs at concentrations of 0.00005% and higher. Such BAC treatment also exhibited a dose-dependent increase in DSBs, evaluated by number of gamma H2AX foci. In addition, a significant change in the relative cell survival rate of HCEs was observed after exposure to 0.001% BAC for 30 min. Although the toxic effects of BAC could be partly repaired after 24 h of cell recovery, SSBs and DSBs in HCEs were still present after BAC removal. The results demonstrated that exposure to BAC in HCEs, even at low concentrations, could induce DNA strand breaks, which were present after BAC removal. Cell survival analysis indicated that BAC-induced DNA damage was correlated with the cytotoxic effects.

Credit risk evaluation using a weighted least squares SVM classifier with design of experiment for parameter selection	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Credit risk evaluation; Weighted LSSVM classifier; Least squares algorithm; Design of experiment; Parameter selection	SUPPORT VECTOR MACHINE; BUSINESS FAILURE PREDICTION; ROUGH SET-THEORY; NEURAL-NETWORK; SCORING MODELS; ALGORITHMS; APPLICANTS; LOANS	Support vector machines (SVM) is proved to be one of the most effective tool in credit risk evaluation. However, the performance of SVM is sensitive not only to the algorithm for solving the quadratic programming but also to the parameters setting in its learning machines as well as to the importance of different classes. In order to solve these issues, this paper proposes a weighted least squares support vector machine (LSSVM) classifier with design of experiment (DOE) for parameter selection for credit risk evaluation. In this approach, least squares algorithm is used to solve the quadratic programming, the DOE is used for parameter selection in SVM modelling and weights in LSSVM are used to emphasize the importance of difference classes. For illustration purpose, two publicly available credit datasets are selected to demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed weighted LSSVM classifier. The results show that the proposed weighted LSSVM classifier with DOE can produce the promising classification results in credit risk evaluation, relative to other classifiers listed in this study.

Whereas it is weakly luminescent when molecularly dissolved in good solvent, it becomes highly emissive when aggregated in poor solvent, exhibiting a novel phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission (AIE). THPSTPA is morphologically and thermally stable, showing high glass transition and thermal degradation temperatures at 150 and 303 degrees C, respectively. The emission of its aggregates can be quenched exponentially by picric acid with a quenching constant up to similar to 7.0 x 10(4) L mol(-1), suggesting that it can work as a sensitive chemosensor for explosive detection.

BESIII Collaboration	eta pi(+)pi(-) Resonant Structure around 1.8 GeV/c(2) and eta(1405) in J/psi -> omega eta pi(+)pi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							GLUEBALL; DECAYS	We present results of a study of the decay J/psi -> omega eta pi(+)pi(-) using a sample of (225.2 +/- 2.8) x 10(6) J/psi events collected by the BESIII detector, and report the observation of a new process J/psi -> omega X(1870) with a statistical significance of 7.2 sigma, in which X(1870) decays to a(0)(+/-)(980)pi(-/+). Fitting to eta pi(+)pi(-) mass spectrum yields a mass M = 1877.3 +/- 6.3(stat)(-7.4)(+3.4)(syst) MeV/c(2), a width Gamma = 57 +/- 12(stat)(-4)(+19)(syst) MeV/c(2), and a product branching fraction B(J/psi -> omega X) x B(X -> a(0)(+/-)(980)pi(-/+)) x B(a(0)(+/-)(980)(->) eta pi(+/-)) = [1.50 +/- 0.26(stat)(-0.36)(+0.72)(syst)] x 10(-4). Signals for J/psi -> omega f(1)(1285) and J/psi -> omega eta(1405) are also clearly observed and measured.	[Ablikim, M.; An, Z. H.; Bai, J. Z.; Berger, N.; Bian, J. M.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, X.

The full-length DNA sequence of TIADH was 1086-bp encoding a polypeptide of 361 amino acids. Comparative and bioinformatic analysis revealed that TIADH showed high similarity to group 3 ADHs from thermophilic and mesophilic alcohol dehydrogenases, but relatively highest similarity to T. maritime 1, 3-propanediol dehydrogenase. The optimal pH-values of butanol oxidation and butylaldehyde reduction of TIADH were 11.9 and 6.0, respectively. Kinetic parameters of the enzymes showed TIADH preferred NADP(+) to NAD(+) as a cofactor. TIADH can catalyze a range of primary alcohols oxidation, while it was inactive towards branched-chain alcohols and cyclitol. TIADH also can reduce aldehydes to corresponding alcohols, including aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes. It showed higher activity of aldehyde reduction than that of alcohol oxidation that may be relative to reactive aldehyde detoxification in cell metabolism. In the case of external ions addition we found a 5.23-fold increase in reaction activity by the adding of 1 mM MnCl2. T. lettinga ADH was cloned and overproduced in a mesophilic heterologous expression system, and the recombinant enzyme was characterized. It will be helpful to understand more about the physiological role of group 3 alcohol dehydrogenase.

The nonisothermal reaction kinetics of DGEBA/PADT is systematically investigated using dynamic DSC with the model-fitting and advanced model-free isoconversional methods. The high reaction heats (115-118 kJ/mol) indicate that PADT can efficiently cure DGEBA, and the reaction activation energy is 55.4 kl/mol. The further reaction kinetic analysis with the Malek method discloses the autocatalytic characteristic, and the Sestak-Berggren model is able to well simulate the reaction rate. Furthermore, the dependence of the effective activation energy on conversion is established from the model-free kinetic analysis with the Vyazovkin method, from which the reaction mechanisms are discussed in detail. Additionally, the isothermal conversion predication from the nonisothermal data is accomplished using the two methods, respectively, with an acceptable match obtained. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Structurally ordered mesoporous silicas (MCM-41, MCM-48 and SBA-15), microporous aluminosilicates (ZSM-5) and macroporous alumina (gamma-Al2O3) with different pore sizes were selected for the immobilization of CoTSPc, and a wide range of pH conditions (pH values from 4 to 12) were tested with the CoTSPc immobilization procedure. In the catalytic oxidation study, CoTSPc that was immobilized to MCM-41 silica (CoTSPc@MCM-41) prepared at a pH of 12 showed the longest catalytic lifetime. The TOC removal and discoloration of C. I. Acid Red 73 was approximately 60% and 82%, respectively, in the presence of CoTSPc@MCM-41 with H2O2 after 3 h. These results indicate that MCM-41, which has a matching size between its mesopores (30 angstrom) and CoTSPc molecules (25 A), can prevent CoTSPc molecules from aggregating and improve its catalytic lifetime. In addition, the ability of CoTSPc@MCM-41 to degrade other dyes, and the reuse studies, demonstrated that CoTSPc@MCM-41 could be reused for the degradation of most common dyes. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

There is strong evidence for the existence of a cortical region in ventral occipitotemporal cortex for processing the visual form of written words. However, due to inconsistent findings obtained with different tasks, the level of specialization and selectivity of this so called visual word form area (VWFA) remains debated. In this study, we examined category selectivity for Chinese characters, a non-alphabetic script, in native Chinese readers. In contrast to traditional approaches of examining response levels in a restricted predefined region of interest (ROI), a detailed distribution of the BOLD signal across the mid-fusiform cortical surface and the spatial patterns of responses to Chinese characters were obtained. Results show that a region tuned for Chinese characters could be consistently found in the lateral part of the left fusiform gyrus in Chinese readers, and this spatial pattern of selectivity for written words was not influenced by top-down tasks such as phonological or semantic modulations. These results provide strong support for the robust spatial coding of category selective response in the mid-fusiform cortex, and demonstrate the utility of the spatial distribution analysis as a more meaningful approach to examine functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.

In the case of explicit chiral symmetry breaking with physical quark masses, it is found that the phase transitions for light u, d, and s quark are sequentially happened, and the separation between the transition lines for different flavors becomes wider and wider with the increase of baryon density. For each flavor, the pseudocritical temperatures for chiral condensate and dressed Polyakov loop differ in a narrow transition range in the lower baryon density region, and the two transitions coincide in the higher baryon density region.

The relevance of these serological markers in type 2 diabetes remains elusive. We investigated the association of serological markers (elongation factor to 1 alpha [EF-1 alpha] stathmin, and N-acetyl-glucosaminidase) with leukocyte telomere length, a functional variant of uncoupling protein-2 (UCP2), and susceptibility of type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A total of 930 patients and 867 control subjects were recruited to examine the association between leukocyte telomere length, UCP2 variant (-886G>A), recently identified serological markers, and type 2 diabetes. Telomere length was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR-based assay. EF-1 alpha, stathmin, and C-reactive proteins were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. N-acetyl-glucosaminidase was measured by an enzyme activity assay. The UCP2 variant was determined by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. RESULTS The average telomere length of type 2 diabetic patients was significantly shorter than that of control subjects. Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase correlates with both age and telomere length and was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects. Neither EF-1 alpha nor stathmin showed significant difference between patients and control subjects. The UCP2-886G>A variant correlated with type 2 diabetes status but did not correlate with telomere length or the serological markers. Multivariate analysis showed that higher serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, shorter telomeres, and the UCP2-886G>A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase, telomere length, and the UCP2 886G>A variant are independent risk factors for type 2 diabetes. Serological N-acetyl-glucosaminidase correlates with telomere length but not with the UCP2-886G>A variant.

Cultures of Caco-2 were exposed to glycyrrhizin. Free SC in culture supernatants, SC protein, and SC mRNA expression were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), western blot, real-time PCR, respectively. Cultures of Caco-2 were exposed to RU486, a glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist, combined with glycyrrhizin or dexamethasone (DEX), SC protein and SC mRNA expression were examined. Glycyrrhizin dose-dependently upregulated free SC in culture supernatants, SC mRNA and protein expression of SC (p<0.05). RU486 could inhibit DEX effects on SC expression (p<0.05), but did not inhibit glycyrrhizin effects on SC expression (p>0.05). The present study indicates that glycyrrhizin has a glucocorticoid-like upregulated effect on SC production in Caco-2 cells. It is likely that this effect is different from the mechanism of glucocorticoids.

The results indicated that a film of SA hydrogel on the surface made the Hb tight and uniform. Compared with the SA-MWCNT-GE, the introduction of Hb lowered the reduction overpotential of TCA by at least 0.90 V. Moreover, the current efficiency decreased dramatically from 78% to 53% when the Hb-MWCNT-GE was used five cycles of dechlorination. In contrast, the current efficiency decreased from 83% to 74% at the Hb/SA-MWCNT-GE. Quantitative analysis of the intermediate products involving dichloroacetic acid, monochloroacetic acid, and acetic acid were also investigated.

We observe that the acceleration of the systems arises naturally in the asymptotic symmetries of (anti-) de Sitter spacetimes. Assuming the validity of the concepts of energy and mass previously introduced in asymptotically flat spacetimes, we find that the emission of pure radiation energy balances the loss of the Bondi mass in certain special families of the Bondi-Sachs rockets, so in these there is no gravitational radiation.

Setting: an urban hospital with 2000-3000 deliveries per year. Method: this study was part of a major action research project that led to implementation of the MNBU. A retrospective cohort and a questionnaire survey were used. The data were analysed thematically. Participants: the outcomes of the first 226 women accessing the MNBU were compared with a matched retrospective cohort of 226 women accessing standard care. In total, 128 participants completed a satisfaction questionnaire before discharge. Main outcome measure: mode of birth and model of care. Findings: the vaginal birth rate was 87.6% in the MNBU compared with 58.8% in the standard care unit. All women who accessed the MNBU were supported by both a midwife and a birth companion, referred to as 'two-to-one' care. None of the women labouring in the standard care unit were identified as having a birth companion. Discussion: the concept of 'two-to-one' care emerged as fundamental to women's experiences and utilisation of midwives' skills to promote normal birth and decrease the likelihood of a caesarean section. Conclusion: the MNBU provides an environment where midwives can practice to the full extent of their role. The high vaginal birth rate in the MNBU indicates the potential of this model of care to reduce obstetric intervention and increase women's satisfaction with care within a context of extraordinary high caesarean section rates. Implications for practice: midwife-led care implies a separation of obstetric care from maternity care, which has been advocated in many European countries. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

However, little is known about the mechanisms by which the MMPs affect ovulation. The present study investigated the degradomic actions of the gelatinases, MMP2 and MMP9, by identifying gelatinolytic targets in periovulatory granulosa cells. Granulosa cells were collected from immature rats 48 h after equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment and were cultured with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the absence or presence of a specific MMP2/9 inhibitor ((2R)-2-[(4-biphenylylsulfonyl)amino]-3-phenylpropionic acid) for an additional 24 h. The conditioned media was analyzed for gelatinolytic activity, progesterone, and peptide profiles. Gelatinolytic activity and progesterone were induced in response to hCG; however, there was no difference in progesterone between cells treated with or without the inhibitor. Peptide fragments of proteins altered in the presence of the gelatinase inhibitor were identified by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Protein disulfide isomerase A3 (PDIA3), which plays a role in protein folding, was identified as a peptide that decreased in the presence of inhibitor while the serine protease hepsin, was found to increase with inhibitor treatment. Subsequent experiments established that PDIA3 and hepsin were targets of MMP2/9 action by cleavage with MMP2 and Western blot analysis, respectively. Additionally, hepsin was identified as a gelatinolytic target in ovarian cancer cells. In the present study, proteomics has identified proteins that may be involved in novel ways in the complex cascades that are mediated by gelatinolytic MMPs during the periovulatory period.

In this study, we report the whole-genome sequence of this clinically important strain. A 38.6-kb AbaR-type genomic resistance island (AbaR22) was identified in MDR-ZJ06. AbaR22 has a structure similar to those of the resistance islands found in A. baumannii strains AYE and AB0057, but it contained only a few antibiotic resistance genes. The region of resistant gene accumulation as previously described was not found in AbaR22. In the chromosome of the strain MDR-ZJ06, we identified the gene bla(oxa-23) in a composite transposon (Tn2009). Tn2009 shared the backbone with other A. baumannii transponsons that harbor bla(oxa-23), but it was bracketed by two ISAba1 elements which were transcribed in the same orientation. MDR-ZJ06 also expressed the armA gene on its plasmid pZJ06, and this gene has the same genetic environment as the armA gene of the Enterobacteriaceae. These results suggest variability of resistance acquisition even in closely related A. baumannii strains.

J	Zhao, KL; Liu, XM; Zhang, WW; Xu, JM; Wang, F				Zhao, Keli; Liu, Xingmei; Zhang, Weiwen; Xu, Jianming; Wang, Fan			Spatial dependence and bioavailability of metal fractions in paddy fields on metal concentrations in rice grain at a regional scale	JOURNAL OF SOILS AND SEDIMENTS			English	Article						Bioavailability; Cross-correlogram; Heavy metals; Sequential fractionation; Soil-rice system	HEAVY-METALS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION; AGRICULTURAL SOILS; LEAD/ZINC MINE; WASTE-WATER; ZN; PB; COPPER; YIELD	Although the bioavailability of heavy metals has been widely investigated, little information is available on the spatial correlations of heavy metals in soil-rice systems at a regional scale. A study of heavy metals in soil-rice systems at a present rice production area could provide valuable information on the safety of rice production and provide guidelines beneficial to agriculture management and strategic sustainable agriculture in China and other rapidly developing regions in the world. The overall goals of this study were to identify the characteristics of metal fractions and their bioavailability to rice plants in the paddy fields of a present rice production region. In the rice harvest season (October 2006), 96 pairs of rice grain and rooted soil samples were collected from rice production area of Wenling in southeast Zhejiang province, China, which is one of the well-known electronic and electric waste (E-waste) recycling centers. Soil samples were analyzed for total heavy metal concentrations, metal fraction concentrations, and soil properties. Soil properties analyzed in this study included soil pH, electrical conductivity, organic matter, Fe oxides, and soil particle size distribution. Rice grain samples were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations. Multivariate statistical and geostatistical methods were applied to study the spatial dependence characteristics of metal fractions and their spatial correlation with uptake by rice plants in the rice production area and to identify the bioavailability of metal fractions to rice plants. The paddy soils of the studied area showed Cd contamination and some paddy soils presented a potential Cu, Ni, and Zn risk. The elevated levels of Cd were predominantly in non-residual (extractable) fractions. The percentage of Cd in fractions decreased in the order of exchangeable > Fe-Mn oxide bound > residual > organic bound fraction. In contrast, soil Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were mainly in the residual (non-extractable) fractions. The fractions of Ni, Pb, and Zn followed the order of residual > Fe-Mn oxide bound > organic bound > exchangeable fraction; the fractions of Cu decreased in the order of residual > organic bound > Fe-Mn oxide bound fraction. The spatial distribution patterns of non-residual fractions exhibited similarities with the highest metal concentrations in the northwest area owing to the industries and E-waste recycling activities. Most metals in rice grain were the strongest spatially correlated with the exchangeable fraction, followed by the organic bound fraction, indicating that exchangeable and organic bound fractions had the highest bioavailability. Rice Cd and Zn were strong spatially correlated with exchangeable, Fe-Mn oxide, and organic bound fractions; rice Ni and Cu were strongly spatially correlated with the exchangeable and organic bound fractions, respectively. The principal component analysis results also confirmed that exchangeable, Fe-Mn oxide, and organic bound soil fractions can be considered as bioavailable fractions to rice for Cd and Zn, while exchangeable and organic fractions were more important sinks for Ni and Cu, respectively. Due to a comparatively high input of Cd in the paddy soils, soil Cd was predominantly associated with non-residual fractions, especially with the exchangeable fraction. The soil Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn were largely associated with the residual fraction while little associated with the exchangeable fraction. The bioavailability of the fractions to rice varied with metal fractions. In general, the exchangeable fraction had the highest bioavailability to rice plants, followed by the organic bound fraction. The bioavailability of the fractions to rice also varied with heavy metals. The exchangeable, Fe-Mn oxide, and organic bound fractions had high bioavailability to rice for Cd and Zn; the exchangeable and organic bound fractions had highest bioavailability for Ni and Cu, respectively.

The experiment was conducted using a rice DH population to detect the QTLs associated with Cr tolerance. Seventeen putative QTLs associated with growth traits included three additive loci and fourteen epistatic loci. These loci were distributed on 11 rice chromosomes, and their contribution to the phenotypic variation ranged from 2.44 to 10.08%. Two QTLs located at the similar genetic region on chromosome ten were associated with shoot Cr concentration and translocation from roots to shoots, respectively; and they accounted for 11.65 and 11.22% of the phenotypic variation. In addition, six QTLs related to Zn concentration and translocation was found on chromosomes 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 12. Meanwhile epistatic effect existed in the two additive QTLs of qRZC1 and qRZC7. Most of QTLs controlling Zn concentration had small genotypic variance and qSRZ4 related to Zn translocation showed growth condition-dependent expression.

This functionalized cellulose nanomaterial was used as an efficient catalyst for the decoloration of reactive dye wastewater. Cellulose acetate was electrospun into nanofiber mats (CA-NM), hydrolyzed with KOH, and then oxidized by NaIO(4) to generate aldehyde groups for CoPc immobilization. The functionalization processes on the nanofiber mats were monitored by attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR/FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM). We found these CoPc-functionalized nanofiber mats (CoPc-NM) have high adsorption capacity for reactive dye from synthetic wastewater, which enhances the catalytic oxidation rate of reactive dye when H(2)O(2) is present as oxidant. More than 90% of reactive red X-3B can be eliminated by CoPc-NM/H(2)O(2) in 90 min. UV and GC-MS analyses indicate the catalytic oxidation not only breaking the azo linkages but also decomposing the aromatic parts of reactive red X-3B, and the main products are biodegradable aliphatic acids, such as fumaric acid, succinic acid, and maleic acid, etc. Repetitive measurements also show that this CoPc-NM is quite stable and remains efficient with no obvious decrease of catalytic activity.

J	Lu, YG				Lu, Yun-guang			Global existence of solutions to resonant system of isentropic gas dynamics	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Nonhomogeneous system of gas dynamics; Flux approximation; Maximum principle; Compensated compactness method; Global solution		In this paper, we study the global existence of weak solutions for the Cauchy problem of nonhomogeneous system of isentropic gas dynamics (1.1) with bounded initial data (1.2). First, we use the maximum principle to obtain the uniformly bounded L(infinity) estimate z(rho(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) <= (B(x). omega rho(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) <= M(t) for the epsilon-viscosity and delta-flux-approximation solutions of (1.1) without the restriction z(0)(x) >= 0 or omega(0)(x) <= 0 as given in the paper Klingenberg and Lu (1997) [8], where omega, z are Riemann invariants of (1.1) and B(x) > 0 is a bounded function of x depending on the function a(x) given in (1.1), but independent of delta, epsilon. Second, we use the compensated compactness theory and the compact frameworks given in Chen and LeFloch (2003) [18], Ding et al. (1989) [19], DiPerna (1983) [15], Lions et al. (1996) [16], Lions et al. (1994) [17] to prove the global existence of weak solutions for the Cauchy problem (1.1)-(1.2). Third, we extend the existence results of weak solutions for a polytropic gas with gamma is an element of (1, 5/3] in Tsuge (2006) [10] to the general pressure function P(rho). (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

The role of CHIP in innate immunity is not known. Here, we report that CHIP knockdown inhibits Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4- and TLR9-driven signaling, but not TLR3-driven signaling; proinflammatory cytokine and type 1 interferon (IFN) production; and maturation of antigen-presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells. We demonstrate that CHIP can recruit the tyrosine kinase Src and atypical protein kinase C zeta (PKC zeta) to the TLR complex, thereby leading to activation of IL-1 receptor-associated kinase 1, TANK-binding kinase 1, and IFN regulatory factors 3 and 7. CHIP acts as an E3 ligase for Src and PKC zeta during TLR signaling. CHIP-mediated enhancement of TLR signaling is inhibited by IFNAR deficiency or expression of ubiquitination resistant mutant forms of Src or PKC zeta. These findings suggest that CHIP facilitates the formation of a TLR signaling complex by recruiting, ubiquitinating, and activating Src and PKC zeta.

The size and shape of the container body in conjunction with simply modifying the container opening accessibility can be used to control the escape rate of water and other gas-phase byproducts in the calcination process, and subsequently affect the nanocrystal growth of the materials inside the mesopore space of the template. In this way, the particle size, mesostructure ordering, and crystallinity of the final product can be systemically controlled. The container effect also explain some of the problems with reproducibility in previously reported results.

Therefore, how to reduce CumVP% has been a treatment issue in recent years. This study aimed to investigate the effects of different pacing algorithms on CumVP% in patients with pacemakers. Methods Pacemakers with three pacing algorithms, i.e., conventional dual chamber rate adaptive pacing (DDDR), search atrioventricular conduction plus (SAV+) and managed ventricular pacing (MVP), were implanted in 42 patients including 41 with bradycardia arrhythmias and one with ventricular tachycardia. Pacemakers were programmed to work in conventional DDDR, SAV+ and MVP during the follow-up periods of the first, the second and the third month. In each pacing algorithm, the time percentages of four pacing and sense status including atrial sense-ventricular sense (AS-VS), atrial sense-ventricular pacing (AS-VP), atrial pacing-ventricular sense (AP-VS) and atrial pacing-ventricular pacing (AP-VP) were calculated. Cumulative ventricular pacing proportions were compared in the three pacing algorithms in the first, the second and the third month postoperatively. Results In the DDDR algorithm AS-VS, AS-VP, AP-VS and AP-VP were 2.4%, 52.3%, 2.5% and 42.8% respectively, while in SAV+ they were 19.3%, 34.9%, 33.9% and 12.0%, in MVP they were 38.9%, 13.2%, 41.6% and 6.4%. In the above the DDDR, SAV+ and MVP algorithms, cumulative ventricular pacing proportions were 95.1%, 46.9% and 19.6%, respectively (P<0.05) and the percentages of CumVP% <40% in patients were 0, 23.8% and 95.2.0% (P<0.05). Conclusions Compared with the conventional DDDR algorithm, both SAV+ and MVP significantly reduced the CumVP%, especially the MVP algorithm. Patients may benefit from MVP algorithm due to reduced CumVP%.

However, a publicly available, systematically integrated and easy-to-use tool for RS-fMRI data processing is still lacking. We developed a toolkit for the analysis of RS-fMRI data, namely the RESting-state fMRI data analysis Toolkit (REST). REST was developed in MATLAB with graphical user interface (GUI). After data preprocessing with SPM or AFNI, a few analytic methods can be performed in REST, including functional connectivity analysis based on linear correlation, regional homogeneity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuation (ALFF), and fractional ALFF. A few additional functions were implemented in REST, including a DICOM sorter, linear trend removal, bandpass filtering, time course extraction, regression of covariates, image calculator, statistical analysis, and slice viewer (for result visualization, multiple comparison correction, etc.). REST is an open-source package and is freely available at http://www.restfmri.net.

Separation of pure flavonoids from plants material is very difficult and chemical syntheses of flavonoids require extreme reaction conditions and toxic chemicals. However, in the past decades, engineered microbes are becoming increasingly important as recombinant production platforms. Cultivation of the recombinant strains in rich medium offers another choice for the production of flavonoids. In the present review, we cover the main achievements that the multi-gene pathway of phenylpropanoid is introduced as microorganisms to heterologously produce flavonoids, analyze the key factors affecting heterologous production of flavonoids in microbes, and discuss the new research prospect.

To enhance the targeted delivery effect of the microcapsules to cancer cells, some specific ligands such as folic acid (FA) are necessarily further conjugated. Herein, covalent poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) multilayers were fabricated on CaCO3 microparticles under the cross-linking of glutaraldehyde, which were further immobilized with different amount of FA molecules via the spacer of diamino terminated poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). As a comparison study, four types of microcapsules, i.e., the PAH capsules, the PAH capsules grafted with PEG, and the PAH capsules conjugated with two different amount of FA via the PEG spacer were prepared. Their chemical and physical structures were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. In vitro cell culture found that the cellular uptake of the PAH capsules grafted with PEG was reduced significantly compared with that of the pure PAH capsules. The FA-modified microcapsules could be selectively delivered into HepG2 tumor cells which overexpress FA receptors but not into the endothelial cells. The number of HepG2 cells which ingested the FA-conjugated capsules showed a positive correlation with FA amount. The results indicate that these FA conjugated capsules have a high selectivity to be delivered to tumor cells, endowing them with a larger opportunity functioning as targeted delivery vehicle for anticancer drugs.

J	Yu, XM; Li, K				Yu, Xiaomin; Li, Kang			Two-dimensional noncommutative atom gas with the Anandan interaction	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							AHARONOV-CASHER PHASE; QUANTUM-MECHANICS; BOHM; TOPOLOGY; COHERENT; DIPOLES; STATES; ANALOG; PLANE; SHIFT	Landau-like quantization of the Anandan system in a special electromagnetic field is studied. Unlike the cases of the Aharonov-Casher (AC) system and the He-McKellar-Wilkens (HMW) system, the torques of the system on the magnetic dipole and the electric dipole do not vanish. By constructing Heisenberg algebra, the Landau analog levels and eigenstates on commutative space, noncommutative (NC) space, and NC phase space are obtained, respectively. By using the coherent state method, some statistical properties of such free-atom gas are studied and the expressions of some thermodynamic quantities related to revolution direction are obtained. Two particular cases of temperature are discussed and the more simple expressions of the free energy on the three spaces are obtained. We give the relation between the value of sigma and revolution direction clearly and find Landau like levels of the Anandan system are invariant and the levels between the AC system and the HMW system are interchanged each other under Maxwell dual transformations on the three spaces. The two sets of eigenstates labeled by sigma can be related by a supersymmetry transformation on commutative space, but the phenomenon do not occur on NC situation. We emphasize that some results relevant to Anandan interaction are suitable for the cases of AC interaction and HMW interaction under special conditions.

Rice yield is severely threatened by saline and alkali stresses. A transgenic rice variety and its wild type (Nipponbare) were treated with four different levels of NaCl / Na2CO3 solutions to study the germination traits (germination percentage, root length, dry weight) of transgenic rice. Rice was found to be more sensitive to Na2CO3 than to NaCl solutions. Germination percentages declined with increasing sodium salts. When treated with 1.5% NaCl, only 40% of Nipponbare and 51% of transgenic rice could survive. The root length of Nipponbare was significantly more restricted than that of transgenic rice. Transgenic rice showed better performance at germination and early seedling growth compared to its wild type under salt and alkali stress.

The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that functional impairment associated with the histopathological findings exists in the motor cortex of MSA patients using resting-state fMRI. Twenty clinically probable MSA patients (9 with MSA-P and 11 with MSA-C subtype) and 11 healthy controls (HCs) were studied. The regional homogeneity (ReHo) approach was used to analyze low frequency spontaneous fluctuation of blood oxygen level dependent signal. Compared with the HCs, the MSA patients showed significantly decreased ReHo in the left primary sensorimotor cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, left lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) and right inferior parietal lobule (IPL), together with increased ReHo in the right primary sensorimotor cortex, bilateral premotor cortices, bilateral supplementary motor areas, medial PFC and left IPL The results support the hypothesis that motor cortex areas can be functionally involved and likely play a role in motor circuit dysfunction in MSA patients.

The same reaction at 80 degrees C afforded [Ni-3(L-2)(4)](PF6)(2) (4). The carbene-transfer reaction of the silver carbene complex with [(eta(3)-C3H5)PdCl](2) yielded the heterotrimetallic complex [AgPd2(eta(3)-C3H5)(2)(L2)(2)] (PF6) (5), whereas the carbene-transfer reaction with Pt(cod)Cl-2 gave [Pt-2(L3)(2)] (PF6)(2) (6). All of these complexes have been fully characterized by ESI-MS, NMR spectroscopy, and elemental analysis. The molecular structures of 1-6 were also studied by X-ray diffraction analysis. In 1-3, three nickel centers are bridged together by three pyrazole NHC ligands and a hydroxide group, forming a 9-metallacrown-3 topology. Complex 4 is paramagnetic, consisting of two square-planar nickel(II) ions and one tetrahedral nickel ion in which three Ni ions are bridged by four pyrazolate units. In the mixed Pd-Ag complex 5, two palladium and one silver centers are bridged by two pyrazole-NHC ligands. Complex 5 showed good catalytic activity in the Sonogashira coupling reaction of aryl bromides and phenylacetylene under mild conditions typically catalyzed by Pd-Cu systems.

LEFT-LATERALIZED N170 RESPONSE TO UNPRONOUNCEABLE PSEUDO BUT NOT FALSE CHINESE CHARACTERS-THE KEY ROLE OF ORTHOGRAPHY	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						N170; Chinese character; orthography; phonology	VISUAL WORD RECOGNITION; TIME-COURSE; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; PHONEME CONVERSION; BRAIN ACTIVATION; LETTER POSITION; LETTER STRINGS; ERP; EXPERTISE; PERCEPTION	A negative event-related potential (ERP) component, known as N170, can be readily recorded over the posterior left brain region when skilled readers are presented with visual words. This left-lateralized word-related N170 has been attributed either to linguistic processes, particularly phonological processing, or to the role of orthographic regularity, emphasizing a perceptual origin. This debate, however, is difficult to resolve in the context of alphabetic scripts because of the tight relations between orthography and phonology. In contrast, Chinese characters have arbitrary mappings between orthographic and sound forms, making it possible to tease apart these two properties of visual words. We therefore addressed this issue by examining ERP responses to Chinese characters and three types of structurally matched but unpronounceable stimuli: pseudo-characters, false-characters, and stroke combinations. A content-irrelevant color matching task was adopted to minimize potentially different top-down modulations across stimulus types. Results show that, relative to false-characters and stroke combinations, real- and pseudo-characters evoked greater N170 in the left posterior brain region. Critically, despite being unpronounceable, pseudo-characters produced the same amplitude and left-lateralized N170, just as real-characters. These results provide strong evidence that orthography rather than phonology serves as the main driver for the enhanced and left-lateralized N170 to visual words. (C) 2011 IBRO.

Besides the underlying structure and dynamics of tagging systems, many efforts have been addressed to unify tagging information to reveal user behaviors and preferences, extract the latent semantic relations among items, make recommendations, and so on. Specifically, this article summarizes recent progress about tag-aware recommender systems, emphasizing on the contributions from three mainstream perspectives and approaches: network-based methods, tensor-based methods, and the topic-based methods. Finally, we outline some other tag-related studies and future challenges of tag-aware recommendation algorithms.

Kinetic studies, chain extension and block copolymerization confirmed the well-controlled manner of these polymerizations in three bronsted acidic ionic liquids. The reactions were fast and the polydispersities of the polymers were quite narrow (1.10<M-w/M-n<1.34). The rate of polymerization in [Hmim][RCOO] decreased with the increasing alkyl chain lengths (n from 1 to 3), indicating a strong dependence of reaction rate on the length of the substituted groups of the anions in ionic liquids.

The observed increases in ABA and Taxol were dependent on the concentration of ozone applied to T. chinensis cell cultures. To examine the role of ABA in ozone-induced Taxol production, we pretreated the cells with ABA biosynthesis inhibitor fluridone to abolish ozone-triggered ABA generation and assayed the effect of fluridone on ozone-induced Taxol production. The results showed that pretreatment of the cells with fluridone not only suppressed the ozone-triggered ABA generation but also blocked the ozone-induced Taxol production. Moreover, our data indicate that the effect of ABA on Taxol production of T. chinensis cell cultures is dose-dependent. Interestingly, the suppression of fluridone on ozone-induced Taxol production was reversed by exogenous application of low dose of ABA, although treatment of low dose ABA alone had no effect on Taxol production of the cells. Together, the data indicated that ozone was an efficient elicitor for improving Taxol production of plant cell cultures. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ABA played critical roles in ozone-induced Taxol production of T. chinensis suspension cell cultures. (C) 2011 American Institute of Chemical Engineers Biotechnol.

However, we found a significant gap between the theory and reality of industrial relocation in Zhejiang province of China. To analyze this phenomenon, the paper explores reasons for the tardiness of industrial relocation on the basis of literature review and survey. Taking the children's garments industrial cluster in the Zhili town, as an example, the paper also analyzes the sticky factors affecting industrial relocation, such as labor costs, sunk costs, capital barriers, industrial cluster effect, social network and regional culture based on interviews and questionnaires.

The evidence from batch tests indicated that the anammox activity was significantly inhibited under highly saline conditions while the inhibition was reversible. Saline shock loading of 30 g NaCl l(-1) caused a 67.5% decrease in specific anammox activity (SAA) compared to reference biomass (not exposed to salt). However, the acclimatized biomass displayed a SAA value just 45.1% lower than that of the reference biomass. When transferred from brine to freshwater, the salt-exposed biomass resumed its activity by 43.1%. Subsequent to appropriate acclimatization, careful manipulation nitrite concentration, nitrogen loading rate (NLR), and other operational parameters for 77 days, the results of continuous-flow experiment revealed that under the salinity of 30 g NaCl l(-1) the reactor performed well and the substrate removal capacity (nitrogen removal rate, NRR, of 448 +/- 15 mgl(-1) d(-1)) was comparable to the condition of freshwater (NRR of 464 +/- 13 mgl(-1) d(-1)). However, the anammox UASB bioreactor was prone to malfunction under transient operating conditions. (C) 2011 The Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The 1H model had three sub-models: Kalman filter (KF) model, artificial neural network (ANN) model and fuzzy combination (FC) model. The KF model forecasted the traffic flow by the linear iteration method based on the historical traffic data. Otherwise, the ANN model was a single-hidden-layer feed-forward neural network built by sonic common S-function neurons. The two individual models reflecting practical problems from different respects were combined by fuzzy logic. The FC model mixed the two individual forecast results and its output was regarded as the final forecasting of the traffic flow. Practical application results show that the 1H model can produce more precise forecasting than that of two individual models.

The one-pot synthesis consists of the tertiary amine modified diarylprolinol silyl ether-mediated asymmetric Michael reaction, a domino Michael reaction/Horner-Wadsworth-Emmons reaction, and a sulfa-Michael reaction. In addition, we have also demonstrated an improved protocol for the domino oxa-Michael/aldol reaction of salicyladehydes with alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehydes with recyclable tertiary amine-modified diarylprolinol silyl ether 3d as an effective organocatalyst, which results in the formation of chiral chromenes with good enantioselectivities (up to 94 % ee). UV/Vis and CD spectroscopy provide a cross-validation method to elucidate the slight difference between electron-withdrawing 3d and diphenylprolinol silyl ether 3a, which can give indirect evidence for the enhancement of enantioselective induction with 3d in the above transformations.

Characterization showed that Ar-BINMOLs exhibit different characteristics to BINOL and act as supramolecules due to hydrogen bonding and aromatic pi-pi/C-H center dot center dot center dot pi interactions. In particular, CD measurements of chiral and racemic Ar-BINMOL 2a in solution and the solid state show a strong Cotton effect, which revealed that amplification of chirality was observed because of the formation of a chiral supramolecular oligomer derived from the racemic monomer. To this end, the Ar-BINMOLs were used as supramolecular auxiliaries to mediate the Michael reaction of anthrone to (E)-beta-nitrostyrene and could give the Michael adduct with comparable enantioselectivities. In addition, the Ar-BINMOLs act as ligands to promote asymmetric 1,2-addition of diethylzinc to aldehydes, which resulted in excellent yields and enantioselectivities (up to >99.9% ee) in the reactions of diethylzinc with a broad range of aromatic aldehdyes.

The process was combined with the exponential feeding method, controlling the feeding rate to maintain the specific growth rate at 0.15 h(-1). The results indicate that the lactose concentration in the feed medium affected directly the expression of the target protein. The use of 50 g/L in the feed medium resulted in the biomass concentration of 39.3 g DCW/L, and an expression level of above 30%, and the maximum final DERA concentration of 16,200 U/L. Furthermore, the acetate concentration remained at a low level in the fed-batch phase, less than 0.5 g/L. In conclusion, combining glucose feeding with lactose induction is a more powerful way to achieve high cell density cultures and to efficiently produce the thermophilic DERA. The results also indicate the potential industrial utility in the scale production of other recombinant proteins.

J	Guo, J; Jiang, HM; Li, JX				Guo, Jia; Jiang, Hong-Min; Li, Jian-Xin			Exploring the relationship between the magnetic frustration and the emergence of FFLO state on a triangular lattice	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						FFLO; Anisotropic triangular lattice; Organic superconductors	HIGH-FIELD SUPERCONDUCTORS; ORGANIC SUPERCONDUCTORS; INHOMOGENEOUS STATE; PHASE; CONDUCTORS; IMPURITIES	The Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) unconventional superconductors attract renewed interest in recent years. However, an unambiguous experimental demonstration of the FFLO state is hindered by the stringent requirements for its realization. In this paper, we explore the relationship between the magnetic frustration and the emergence of the FFLO state on an anisotropic triangular lattice, based on the self-consistent calculation of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. We find that the required lower critical magnetic field to enter the FFLO state decreases with the increase of both the anisotropic ratio and the on-site Coulomb repulsive interaction. This demonstrates that it is easier to enter the FFLO state on the structurally frustrated triangular lattice in comparison with the square lattice, and suggests that the layered organic superconductors with a triangular lattice may be good candidates for exploring the FFLO state.

For nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) parameters, however, the chemical shift and quadrupole coupling constant (QCC) of the solid crystals are considerably affected by hydrogen bonding and van der Waals interactions from neighboring molecules and the crystal lattice leading to significant spectroscopic differences compared to isolated monomer molecules. Therefore, it is necessary to take these two factors into account for the precise predictions of chemical shifts and QCCs of solid crystals. L-alanylglycine dipeptide and nitrobenzene were selected as model crystals to demonstrate these effects. Here, the chemical shielding (CS) and QCC data were calculated based on the periodic structure model. The incorporation of intermolecular hydrogen bonding and crystal lattice effects by periodic models was found to be crucial in obtaining reliable predictions of CS and QCC values and rendering more explicit spectroscopic assignments for solid organic and biological systems.

PLANT CELL TISSUE AND ORGAN CULTURE			English	Article						Cotton; Somatic hybrid; Protoplast fusion; Plant regeneration; Male sterility	GOSSYPIUM-HIRSUTUM; PROTOPLAST FUSION; PLANT-REGENERATION; EMBRYOGENESIS; HYBRIDIZATION; CULTURES	Somatic hybrids were produced through protoplast electrofusion between the tetraploid cotton Gossypium hirsutum L. cv. ZDM-3 and the wild diploid cotton G. klotzschianum. Hybrid plants were generated from 3 out of 24 callus lines that were derived from fused protoplasts. Hybrid plants were initially identified as somatic hybrids by ploidy analysis: the plants from the 3 callus lines had chromosome numbers near to sum of the two parents (78 = 52 + 26). The plants from the 3 lines were subsequently confirmed as hybrids by cytological, molecular, histological and morphological analyses. The morphology of hybrids was distinct from that of the parents, with elongated stigmas and malformed anthers lacking microspores and pollen, leading to male sterility. It is expected that the male sterility resulted from the high number of univalent and irregular multivalent chromosome pairings per meiocyte.

ASIAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						cultural representativeness; emotional reaction; morality; scandal	CORRUPTION	A scandal can evoke public outrage when it is widely publicized and involves an individual who is perceived to have a high level of cultural representativeness. Two experiments showed that when the scandalous target's moral character was highlighted, emotional responses towards the target were least negative when the scandal was widely circulated and when the target was seen as a representative of his culture. These results suggest that when a cultural symbol is implicated in a widely-circulated scandal, the negative emotions directed towards the scandalous individual can be alleviated when the public remains confident in his or her commitment to morality.

Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 107 (2010) 4511), in this letter, we propose an improved method by introducing an item-oriented function, focusing on solving the dilemma of the recommendation accuracy between the cold and popular items. Differently from previous works, the present algorithm does not require any additional information (e. g., tags). Further experimental results obtained in three real datasets, RYM, Netflix and MovieLens, show that, compared with the original hybrid method, the proposed algorithm significantly enhances the recommendation accuracy of the cold items, while it keeps the recommendation accuracy of the overall and the popular items. This work might shed some light on both understanding and designing effective methods for long-tailed online applications of recommender systems.

This review examines the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions and regulation of the enzyme telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT), which functions as the primary mechanism of telomere maintenance and regulates cellular life expectancy. Underpinning increased cell proliferation, telomerase is also a key factor in facilitating cancer cell immortalization. The review focuses on aspects of hormonal regulations of telomerase, and the intracellular pathways that converge to regulate telomerase activity with an emphasis on molecular interactions at protein and gene levels. In addition, the basic structure and function of two key telomerase enzyme components-the catalytic subunit TERT and the template RNA (TERC) are discussed briefly.

Closed-shell ring coupled cluster doubles theory with range separation applied on weak intermolecular interactions	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							RANDOM-PHASE-APPROXIMATION; CORRELATED MOLECULAR CALCULATIONS; GAUSSIAN-BASIS SETS; RARE-GAS DIMERS; INTERACTION ENERGIES; DISPERSION ENERGY; SYSTEMS; FORCES; COMPLEXES; EXPANSION	We explore different variants of the random phase approximation to the correlation energy derived from closed-shell ring-diagram approximations to coupled cluster doubles theory. We implement these variants in range-separated density-functional theory, i.e., by combining the long-range random phase approximations with short-range density-functional approximations. We perform tests on the rare-gas dimers He-2, Ne-2, and Ar-2, and on the weakly interacting molecular complexes of the S22 set of Jurecka et al. [P. Jurecka, J. Sponer, J. Cerny, and P. Hobza, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 8, 1985 (2006)]. The two best variants correspond to the ones originally proposed by Szabo and Ostlund [A. Szabo and N. S. Ostlund, J. Chem. Phys. 67, 4351 (1977)].

We investigated this issue in a unique patient with lesions in the splenium of the corpus callosum and the left medial occipitotemporal region, through a series of neuropsychological tests and multimodal MRI scans. Behavioral experiments showed that (1) the patient had difficulties in reading simple and compound Chinese characters when they were presented in the foveal but left to the fixation, (2) he failed to recognize the left component of compound characters when the compound characters were presented in the central foveal field, (3) his judgments of the gender of centrally presented chimeric faces were exclusively based on the left half-face and he was unaware that the faces were chimeric. Functional MRI data showed that Chinese characters, only when presented in the right foveal field but not in the left foveal field, activated a region in the left occipitotemporal sulcus in the mid-fusiform, which is recognized as visual word form area. Together with existing evidence in the literature, results of the current study suggest that the representation of foveal stimuli is functionally split at object processing levels.

Florigen moves through the phloem to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where it induces flowering. In Arabidopsis, the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein acts as a component of this phloem-mobile signal. However whether the transportable FT mRNA also contributes to systemic florigen signalling remains to be elucidated. Using non-conventional approaches that exploit virus-induced RNA silencing and meristem exclusion of virus infection, we demonstrated that the Arabidopsis FT mRNA, independent of the FT protein, can move into the SAM. Viral ectopic expression of a non-translatable FT mRNA promoted earlier flowering in the short-day (SD) Nicotiana tabacum Maryland Mammoth tobacco in SD. These data suggest a possible role for FT mRNA in systemic floral signalling, and also demonstrate that cis-transportation of cellular mRNA into SAM and meristem exclusion of pathogenic RNAs are two mechanistically distinct processes.

The model predicts that trans- and cis-bent geometries of neutral dimetallenes may be stabilized from the planar geometry but with very small energy gains and that these geometries should be largely stabilized with significant bend angles and stabilization energies in dimetallene anions. Twisting around the double bonds of dimetallenes may lower the energy of the anions. The above prediction is verified by the potential energy surface calculations at the B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,3pd) level.

This is the first report on cloning and expression of amylolytic gene from the industrially important microorganism A. pullulans. The purified recombinant protein with MW of 66 kDa and specific activity of 298.02 Umg(-1) protein was verified as a glucoamylase by its hydrolytic mode. This recombinant glucoamylase with optimal pH of 4.5, and temperature of 60 degrees C, showed good hydrolytic activity against raw potato starch. At 60 degrees C, 83.1% of raw potato starch slurry (150 gl(-1)) was hydrolysed into glucose by 0.1 U mg(-1) starch purified recombinant glucoamylase in less than 2.5 h. This is the highest raw starch hydrolysis efficiency report about recombinant fungal glucoamylase. This useful property indicated that this glucoamylase may find important applications in the starch saccharification industry and in bioethanol production.

High silver salt loads of up to 13% with respect to the disperse phase were achieved. The silver/poly(HEMA) hybrid particles were subsequently formed via a gas-phase in situ reduction of AgBF4 by hydrazine on the surfaces of silver salt/poly(HEMA) particles. The formation of silver nanoparticles was confirmed by UV-vis spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. The morphology of the hybrid particles of silver salt/poly(HEMA) and silver/poly(HEMA) was fully characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and dynamic light scattering (DLS). The influence of the reaction parameters including the type and amount of cosolvent, salt content, and type of surfactant on the particle properties and colloidal stability during the reduction process was thoroughly investigated.

The structures of polymer and metal-coordination polymer were verified with infrared ray spectrometry, ultraviolet spectrometry and elemental analysis. Meanwhile, the scanning electron microscope (SEM) results suggested that the homogeneous and spherical particles were formed. Finally, The magnetic properties of the two coordinated polymers were tested. The results show that both exhibited ferromagnetism in low temperature. Ni(2+)-coordination polymer was a hard-ferromagnet due to its large values of coercive force, remanent magnetization and area of magnetic hysteresis loop. However, Tb(3+)-coordination polymer was a soft-ferromagnet ascribed to its small values of coercive force, remanent magnetization and area of magnetic hysteresis loop.

J	Yu, L; Lu, JB				Yu, Lin; Lu, Jianbo			Does Landscape Fragmentation Influence Sex Ratio of Dioecious Plants? A Case Study of Pistacia chinensis in the Thousand-Island Lake Region of China	PLOS ONE			English	Article							HABITAT FRAGMENTATION; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION; PATERNITY ANALYSIS; POLLEN DISPERSAL; POPULATION-SIZE; POLLINATOR; PATTERNS; ECOSYSTEM; CONSEQUENCES; DENSITY	The Thousand-Island Lake region in Zhejiang Province, China is a highly fragmented landscape with a clear point-in-time of fragmentation as a result of flooding to form the reservoir. Islands in the artificial lake were surveyed to examine how population sex ratio of a dioecious plant specie Pistacia chinensis B. was affected by landscape fragmentation. A natural population on the mainland near the lake was also surveyed for comparison. Population size, sex ratio and diameter at breast height (DBH) of individuals were measured over 2 years. More than 1,500 individuals, distributed in 31 populations, were studied. Soil nitrogen in the different populations was measured to identify the relationship between sex ratio and micro-environmental conditions. In accordance with the results of many other reports on biased sex ratio in relation to environmental gradient, we found that poor soil nitrogen areas fostered male-biased populations. In addition, the degree of sex ratio bias increased with decreasing population size and population connectivity. The biased sex ratios were only found in younger individuals (less than 50 years old) in small populations, while a stable 1:1 sex ratio was found in the large population on the mainland. We concluded that the effects of landscape fragmentation on the dioecious population sex ratio were mainly achieved in relation to changing soil nitrogen conditions in patches and pollen limitation within and among populations. Large populations could maintain a more suitable environment in terms of nutrient conditions and pollen flow, subsequently maintaining a stable sex ratio in dioecious plant populations. Both micro-environmental factors and spatial structure should be considered in fragmented landscape for the conservation of dioecious plant species.

Since 1981, there has been a great increase in the number of monographs and academic papers on Charles Dickens, with remarkable achievements indicative of burgeoning scope, diversified approaches and tremendously improved research conditions. In other words, Dickens studies in China has entered an age of prosperity. For all its prosperity, however, there remain some problems, such as the scarcity of heated debates within domestic circles, repetitive low-level research, and the lack of in-depth dialogues with international mainstream discourse on Dickens, which often results in mechanical application of research findings from abroad.

Spin dynamics in the stripe phase of high-T-c cuprates with the modulation of superconducting order	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL B			English	Article							COPPER-OXIDE SUPERCONDUCTORS; MAGNETIC FLUCTUATIONS; TEMPERATURE; LA2-XSRXCUO4; EXCITATIONS; SCATTERING	Possible superconducting order modulation and its effect on the spin susceptibility in the coexisting phase of the stripe and superconducting orders are investigated. It is shown that the superconducting order modulation is mainly caused by the spin-domain-derived scattering, while the charge-domain-derived scattering tends to suppress it in a wide parameter region. The modulation leads to a two-peak structure in the spin excitation spectrum, which is qualitatively consistent with the recent experimental observations in La2-xSrxCuO4. This result suggests the importance of the superconducting order modulation for the understanding of the multiform spin excitations in these cuprate superconductors.	[Zhou, J.; Guo, J.; Li, J.

J	Wang, YL; Ding, Y; Ni, J				Wang, Yanli; Ding, Yi; Ni, Jun			Electronic structures of Fe-terminated armchair boron nitride nanoribbons	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							GRAPHENE; CARBON	Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of Fe-terminated armchair boron nitride nanoribbons (Fe-ABNNRs). We find that Fe atoms can form a dimerized zigzag chain along the armchair edge. Different from the semiconducting H-terminated ABNNRs, the Fe-ABNNRs are antiferromagnetic metals. When one edge is terminated by Fe atoms and the other edge by H atoms, the ABNNRs become half-metals regardless of the ribbon width. Other transition-metal terminated nanoribbons are also examined, which are semiconductors or half-metals with diverse magnetic states depending on the types of metals.

Nitric oxide generation and flavonoid accumulation are two early reactions of plants to ultraviolet-B (UV-B) irradiation. However, the source of UV-B-triggered NO generation and the role of NO in UV-B-induced flavonoid accumulation are not fully understood. In order to evaluate the origin of UV-B-triggered NO generation, we examined the responses of nitrate reductase (NR) activity and the expression levels of NIA1 and NIA2 genes in leaves of Betula pendula Roth (silver birch) seedlings to UV-B irradiation. The data show that UV-B irradiation stimulates NR activity and induces up-regulation of NIA1 but does not affect NIA2 expression during UV-B-triggered NO generation. Pretreatment of the leaves with NR inhibitors tungstate (TUN) and glutamine (Gln) abolishes not only UV-B-triggered NR activities but also UV-B-induced NO generation. Furthermore, application of TUN and Gln suppresses UV-B-induced flavonoid production in the leaves and the suppression of NR inhibitors on UV-B-induced flavonoid production can be reversed by NO via its donor sodium nitroprusside. Together, the data indicate that NIA1 in the leaves of silver birch seedlings is sensitive to UV-B and the UV-B-induced up-regulation of NIA1 may lead to enhancement of NR activity. Furthermore, our results demonstrate that NR is involved in UV-B-triggered NO generation and NR-mediated NO generation is essential for UV-B-induced flavonoid accumulation in silver birch leaves.

The EECCC took full advantages of the liquid nature of the stationary phase for a complete sample recovery and extended the solute hydrophobicity window, while CECCC showed its unique advantage in achieving effective separation of special compounds through preventing stationary phase loss. In the present work, the biphasic liquid system composed of n-hexane/ethyl acetate/methanol/water (1:2:12, v/v/v/v) was used for separation of apocynin and androsin, ethyl acetate/n-butanol/water/formic acid (4:1:5:0.005, v/v/v/v) for picroside I, II and III. However, due to the extremely similar K values (K-1/K-2 approximate to. 1.2), picroside I and III were always eluted together by several biphasic solvent systems. In this case, the CECCC exhibited great superiority and baseline separated in the sixth cycle using ethyl acetate/water (1:1, v/v) as biphasic liquid system. Each fraction was analyzed by UPLC-UV and ESI-MS analysis, and identified by comparing with the data of reference substances. Compared with classical elution, the combination of EE and CE approach exhibits strong separation efficiency and great potential to be a high-throughput separation technique in the case of complex samples.

Here, we performed genome-scale expression profiling analysis of silkworm PSG at the fourth molting (M4) and at day 1 (V1), day 3 (V3), day 5 (Vs), and wandering stage (W) of the fifth instar by microarray analysis with 22 987 probes. We found that the five genes of silk proteins secreted from PSG including fibroin heavy (H) and light (L) chains, P25, seroin 1, and seroin 2 basically showed obvious up-regulation at V3 which lasted to V5, while slight down-regulation at W. The expression of translation-related genes including ribosomal proteins and translation initiation factors generally remained stable from M4 to V5, whereas it showed clear down-regulation at W. Clustering analysis of the 643 significantly differentially expressed transcripts revealed that 43 of the important genes including seroin 1 and sugar transporter protein had co-expression patterns which were consistent with the rate changes of fibroin synthesis and PSG growth. Pathway analysis disclosed that the genes in different clusters might have co-regulations and and direct interactions. These genes were supposed to be involved in the fibroin synthesis and secretion. The differential expression of several hormone-related genes also suggested their functions on the regulation of PSG development and fibroin synthesis. 2D gel-based proteomics and phosphoproteomics profiling revealed that the phosphorylated proteins accounted for no more than one-sixth of the total proteins at each stage, which was much lower than the level in normal eukaryotic cells. Changes in the phosphorylation status and levels of several proteins such as actin-depolymerizing factor 1 and enolase might be deeply involved in fibroin secretion and tissue development. Shotgun proteomic profiling combined with label-free quantification analysis on the PSG at V3, V5, and W revealed that many small heat shock proteins (sHSP) were specially expressed at W, which was substantially consistent with the results from 2-DE analysis, and implied the close correlations of sHSP with the physiological states of PSG at W. A majority of significantly up-regulated proteins at V5 were related to ribosome pathway, which was different from the microarray results, implying that the translation-level regulation of ribosomal proteins might be critical for fibroin synthesis. In contrast, the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway related proteins appeared obviously up-regulated at W, suggesting that the programmed cell death process of PSG cells might be started before cocooning.

Based on an accelerating primer (AP), the present assay, named AP-LAMP, has the advantages of rapidity and sensitivity over the routine LAMP method. The possible AP-based amplification pathway during the reaction was revealed by restriction enzyme digestion and eletrophoresis. The detection limit of the AP-LAMP assay was approximately 84 IU/ml, and no cross-detection was observed.

The mutant, designated as spl30 (spotted-leaf30), displayed normal green leaf color under shade but exhibited red-brown lesions under natural summer field conditions. Initiation of the lesions was induced by light and the symptom was enhanced at 33 degrees C relative to 26 degrees C. Histochemical staining did not show cell death around the red-brown lesions. Chlorophyll contents in the mutant were significantly lower than those of the wild type while the ratio of chlorophyll a/b remained the same, indicating that spl30 was impaired in biosynthesis or degradation of chlorophyll. Disease reaction patterns of the mutant to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae were largely unchanged to most races tested except for a few strains. Genetic analysis showed that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive gene, tentatively named spl30(t), which co-segregated with RM15380 on chromosome 3, and was delimited to a 94 kb region between RM15380 and RM15383. Spl30(t) is likely a novel rice spotted-leaf gene since no other similar genes have been identified near the chromosomal region. The genetic data and recombination populations provided in this study will enable further fine-mapping and cloning of the gene.

CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						Oryza sativa; morphological and physiological analysis; genetic mechanism; map-based cloning	LEAF SENESCENCE; CELL-DEATH; PROTEIN; MICRORNA399; CLONING; GENE; PHO2	An es-t (early senescence-temporary) mutant, produced by ethylene methylsulfonate treatment of strain Nipponbare, was identified in rice. The leaves of es-t appeared yellow at the seedling stage, and had decreased chlorophyll content. Rust spots were found during growth in es-t, especially at the leaf margin and tip. The plants showed a typical early-senescence phenotype at the milky stage. The leaf surface of es-t appeared smoother than wild-type leaves under a scanning electron microscope, because the leaves lack siliceous protuberances around the stoma. Chloroplasts grow abnormally and are filled with many starch grains in es-t. Paraffin section analysis showed that the development of the sclerenchyma cells and vascular bundles were also abnormal in es-t. Genetic analysis indicated that es-t was controlled by a recessive gene, which was finely mapped to a 42-kb interval on chromosome 5. These results will facilitate the positional cloning and functional studies of the gene.

SP.; CILIOPHORA; ZOOTHAMNIUM; OLIGOHYMENOPHOREA; PSEUDOVORTICELLA	The process of stomatogenesis in peritrich ciliates is still incompletely understood. Previous studies on the stomatogenesis of four species of peritrichs, Telotrochidium sp., Carchesium polypinum, Opercularia coarctata, and Astylozoon pyriforme conflict with one another in some cases and omit details of events in others. We described the entire process of stomatogenesis in the peritrich ciliate Campanella umbellaria (C. umbellaria) using an improved method of staining with protargol. Our results disagree with some previous studies with regard to the formation of some rudimentary structures, reorganization of the parental haplokinety, formation of new germinal rows, and separation of daughter oral complexes. The pattern of stomatogenesis characteristic of peritrichs is compared to the stomatogenetic patterns of three other oligohymenophorean subclasses and a hypothesis about the evolution of stomatogenesis in the class Oligohymenophorea is offered. Details of stomatogenesis need to be described and verified in a greater variety of peritrichs to clarify possible differences between taxa and make it possible to relate stomatogenesis to evolution within the subclass Peritrichia. Ultrastructural studies are the next step in description of morphogenetic processes in peritrichs, and characteristics of C. umbellaria make it a useful model for this work. J.

The triplet state energy of Hamq was determined to be 22,370 cm(-1) via the phosphorescence spectra of Hamq and its gadolinium complex. The title complex monomer Eu(tta)(2)(amq) was prepared by coordination reaction of Hamq with europium isopropoxide and 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (Htta) in dry organic solvents under argon atmosphere and characterized by elemental analysis and IR spectrum. The photophysical properties of the complex were studied in detail with UV-vis, luminescence spectra, luminescence lifetime and quantum yield. The complex exhibited nearly monochromatic red emission at 612 nm, a remarkable luminescence quantum yield at room temperature (30.6%) upon ligand excitation and a long (5)D(0) lifetime (389 mu s), which indicated that the ligand Hamq could sensitize the luminescence of Eu(III) ion efficiently in Eu(tta)2(amq), resulting in a strong luminescence of its copolymer poly[MMA-co-Eu(TTA)(2)(amq)] under UV excitation. The excellent luminescence properties of the complex made it not only a promising light-conversion molecular device but also an excellent luminescent monomer. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

J	Jiang, HM; Guo, J; Li, JX				Jiang, Hong-Min; Guo, Jia; Li, Jian-Xin			Effects of vortices and impurities on the nuclear spin relaxation rate in iron-based superconductors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							PHASE-DIAGRAM; GAPS; NMR	The effects of magnetic vortices and nonmagnetic impurities on the low-energy quasiparticle excitations and the spin-lattice relaxation rate are examined in the iron-based superconductors for the s(+/-)-, s-, and d-wave pairing symmetries. The main effect of the vortices is to enhance the quasiparticle excitations and the spin-lattice relaxation rate for all symmetries, which leads to a T-3 dependence of the relaxation rate followed by a nearly linear T dependence at lower temperatures. This enhancement can only be seen for the s(+/-)- and d-wave symmetries in the presence of nonmagnetic impurities. These results suggest that the s(+/-)-wave and d-wave pairing states behave similarly in response to the magnetic field and nonmagnetic impurities, therefore, it may be impossible to distinguish them on the basis of the measurements of spin-lattice relaxation rates when a magnetic field and/or impurity scatterings are present.

J	Cao, C; Dai, JH				Cao, Chao; Dai, Jianhui			Block Spin Ground State and Three-Dimensionality of (K, Tl)(y)Fe1.6Se2	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; INSULATOR	The magnetic properties and electronic structure of (K, Tl)(y)Fe1.6Se2 is studied using first-principles calculations. The ground state is checkerboard antiferromagnetically coupled blocks of the minimal Fe-4 squares, with a large block-spin moment similar to 11.2 mu(B). The magnetic interactions could be modeled with a simple spin model involving both the inter-and intrablock, as well as the nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor couplings. The calculations also suggest a metallic ground state except for y = 0: 8 where a band gap similar to 400-550 meV opens, showing an antiferromagnetic insulator ground state for (K, Tl)(y)Fe1.6Se2. The electronic structure of the metallic (K, Tl)(y)Fe1.6Se2 is highly three dimensional with unique Fermi surface structure and topology. These features indicate that the Fe-vacancy ordering is crucial to the physical properties of (K, Tl)(y)Fe1.6Se2.

However, given the large difference between Chinese characters and alphabetic scripts in terms of their orthographic rules, it is not clear at a fine spatial scale, whether Chinese characters engage the same VWFA in the occipito-temporal cortex as alphabetic scripts. We specifically compared Chinese with Korean script, with Korean script serving as a good example of alphabetic writing system, but matched to Chinese in the overall square shape. Sixteen proficient early Chinese-Korean bilinguals took part in the fMRI experiment. Four types of stimuli (Chinese characters, Korean characters, line drawings and unfamiliar Chinese faces) were presented in a block-design paradigm. By contrasting characters (Chinese or Korean) to faces, presumed VWFAs could be identified for both Chinese and Korean characters in the left occipito-temporal sulcus in each subject. The location of peak response point in these two VWFAs were essentially the same. Further analysis revealed a substantial overlap between the VWFA identified for Chinese and that for Korean. At the group level, there was no significant difference in amplitude of response to Chinese and Korean characters. Spatial patterns of response to Chinese and Korean are similar. In addition to confirming that there is an area in the left occipito-temporal cortex that selectively responds to scripts in both Korean and Chinese in early Chinese-Korean bilinguals, our results show that these two scripts engage essentially the same VWFA, even at the level of fine spatial patterns of activation across voxels. These results suggest that similar populations of neurons are engaged in processing the different scripts within the same VWFA in early bilinguals.

The transmitted field of an arbitrarily polarized incident wave through this bilayered structure is nearly circularly polarized with a circular polarization extinction ratio of more than 30 dB at resonance. We show that the origin of this phenomenon is the excitation of spinning electric dipoles in the wheel patterns, which blocks the transmission of one-handed circularly polarized component but exert little influence on the other. We also demonstrate that the operation bandwidth can be enhanced by stacking functional layers in the propagation direction. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

This study was conducted in order to investigate the protective effect of the herbal constituent allicin on VSV-induced apoptosis in the human monocyte line THP-1, human T lymphocytic leukemia cell line MT-2 and human amniotic cell line WISH and to determine the possible molecular mechanism involved. The THP-1, MT-2 and WISH cells were incubated with VSV in the absence or presence of different doses of allicin (10, 25 and 50 mu g/ml). To study apoptosis, the cells were assessed by MTT and annexin V-propidium iodide double-staining flow cytometry. To investigate the molecular mechanism by which allicin regulates VSV-induced THP-1, MT-2 and WISH cell apoptosis, the expression of active cleavage products of caspases 3, 6, 7 and 9 and NF-kappa B was analyzed by western blotting. Our results indicated that allicin did not affect the adhesion and entry of VSV into THP-1, MT-2 or WISH cells. Using different concentrations of allicin, a dose-dependent protective effect on cell apoptosis was observed. In addition, the VSV-induced expression of active cleavage products of caspases 3, 6, 7 and 9 and NF-kappa B in THP-1, MT-2 and WISH cells was also significantly reduced by allicin at the protein level. We concluded that allicin protects THP-1, MT-2 and WISH cells from VSV-induced apoptosis by inhibiting the activation of caspases 3, 6, 7 and 9 and NF-kappa B, thereby suggesting a potential protective effect for allicin against virus-associated diseases.

The cross-spectral density matrix is deduced and employed to calculate the changes in the spectral degree of polarization of the beam on propagation. It is shown that the spectral degree of polarization can be modulated by changing the chiral parameter of the medium and the coherent parameter of the beam. Also, it is interesting to find that the spectral degree of polarization of a stochastic electromagnetic beam on propagation in far zone is different from that of the source.

It was found that phase behaviors depended crucially on the composition in blend. First, dewetting morphologies in SAN50 and SAN70 were still under the control of U(q0)/E, which was introduced in our previous work [Polymer 2009, 50, 4456] to distinguish different dewetting pathways. Here, U(q0) and E described the initial amplitude of the surface undulation and original thickness of film, respectively; second, composition produced significant influences on its gradient in composition fluctuation, resulting in the accelerated (or suppressed) dewetting; last, this kind of acceleration or suppression affected the following interplay between phase separation and dewetting so much. Using two samples of "dewetting/wetting-phase separation" and "wetting-dewetting/phase separation" with different components, we discussed the interplay mechanism of them in detail. In conclusion, our results indicate that dewetting, phase separation, and the following interplay between them are sensitive to composition in blend. Furthermore, composition gradient plays an important role in them.

However, what remains unclear is whether MDD also shows deficits in the unconscious processing of either positive or negative emotions. We conducted a psychological study in healthy and MDD subjects to investigate unconscious emotion processing and its valence-specific alterations in MDD patients. Methods: We combined a well established paradigm for unconscious visual processing, the continuous flash suppression, with positive and negative emotional valences to detect the attentional preference evoked by the invisible emotional facial expressions. Results: Healthy subjects showed an attentional bias for negative emotions in the unconscious condition while this valence bias remained absent in MDD patients. In contrast, this attentional bias diminished in the conscious condition for both healthy subjects and MDD. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate for the first time valence-specific deficits specifically in the unconscious processing of emotions in MDD; this may have major implications for subsequent neurobiological investigations as well as for clinical diagnosis and therapy.

The in vitro transdermal release profiles were determined by Franz diffusion cells. The content of elemene in the collected samples was determined by gas chromatograph. Polyvinyl alcohol and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose were chosen as drug-loaded matrices. The optimal amount of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose in matrices was 30% (w/w). It was found that azone was the best one among several penetration enhancers, compared with oleinic acid, eucalyptus oil and laurinol. Moreover, using azone together with propylene glycol, the permeation effect of elemene was even better. The appropriate ratio between azone and propylene glycol was 1:1. Moreover, 2% azone and 2% propylene glycol together as permeation enhancers achieved the best permeation effect for the elemene transdermal drug delivery system. The solution containing 20% saline, 50% ethanol and 30% PEG-400 was a good receiving media for beta-elemene in Franz diffusion cells. The amount of polyvinyl alcohol and sodium carboxymethyl cellulose in the matrices had obvious effects on the penetration ability of elemene. Types and concentration of the penetration enhancers had effect on the permeability of elemene through skin.

This paper presents a novel human motion model for generating and editing motions with multiple factors. A set of motions performed by several actors with various styles was captured for constructing a well-structured motion database. Subsequently, MICA (multilinear independent component analysis) model that combines ICA and conventional multilinear framework was adopted for the construction of a multifactor model. With this model, new motions can be synthesized by interpolation and through solving optimization problems for the specific factors. Our method offers a practical solution to edit stylistic human motions in a parametric space learnt with MICA model. We demonstrated the power of our method by generating and editing sideways stepping, reaching, and striding over obstructions using different actors with various styles. The experimental results show that our method can be used for interactive stylistic motion synthesis and editing. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Selenium (Se) is an essential trace element for living organisms, which has been shown to play a major role in thyroid hormone levels and the nutritional metabolism. The aims of the present study were to assess the changes in serum levels of selenium and their correlation with disorders of the endocrine and nutritional metabolism in HD patients. Methods: Fifty-three uremic patients with hemodialysis were evaluated; 30 healthy volunteers served as controls. Baseline serum concentrations of total triiodothyronine (TT3), free triiodothyronine (FT3), total thyroxine (TT4), and free thyroxine (FT4) were determined by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Serum levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) were measured by a sensitive immunoradiometric assay (IRMA). Serum selenium was analyzed using Hitachi Z- 2000 polarized Zeeman atomic absorption spectrometry. Other metabolic variables were measured in all patients and control subjects. Multiple correlation analysis was performed among variables. Results: Higher serum triglyceride, LDL-C, ApoB and lower albumin, HDL-C levels were found in subjects with HD. Mean serum selenium concentration was significantly lower in the HD group than in the control group (p<0.01). The levels of serum TT3 and FT3 in HD patients were significantly lower than in healthy control subjects (p<0.01; p<0.05, respectively), but TT4, FT4 and TSH were not different. However, serum iPTH levels were significantly higher in patients than in controls (p<0.01). In the group of HD patients, serum selenium levels were significantly positively correlated with albumin, HDL-C, TT(3) and FT(3); and negatively correlated with triglyceride (TG), LDL-C, ApoB and iPTH. Both serum TT3 and FT3 levels were significantly positively correlated with HDL-C; and negatively correlated with TG, LDL-C and ApoB. Conclusions: These data suggest that hyposelenemia in HD patients correlated with euthyroid sick syndrome with low T3 levels, and nutritional status with hyperlipidemia and hypoalbuminemia which might be involved in dysfunction in the endocrine and nutrition metabolism in dialysis patients.

The thirteen loci were screened on a group of 48 individuals from two populations, one in Yong'an and the other in Ganzhou. These markers revealed a relatively high degree of genetic diversity (4-12 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (Ho ranged from 0.213-0.854 and He ranged from 0.301-0.838). Tests for departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and for linkage disequilibrium were conducted for each of the two populations separately. After sequential Bonferroni correction, none of the 13 loci showed significant departures from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance indicated that a small but significant (P < 0.001) proportion (16.0%) of the total variation in the microsatellite DNA data were attributable to differences among populations, indicating geographical structuring and restricted gene flow. It could be attributable to the Wuyi mountains in the area having a sufficiently isolating effect to significantly reduce gene flow. Our microsatellite data also showed a low N-m (1.31) value in the two populations from mainland China. Thus, the Yong'an and Ganzhou populations could be treated as distinct evolutionarily significant units (ESUs). The high level of polymorphism revealed by these microsatellite markers will be useful for the study of gene flow, population structure and evolutionary history of N. atra.

To investigate the effect of ozone on the production of desired compounds of plant cell cultures, we assayed hypericin production of Hypericum perforatum suspension cell cultures treated with different doses of ozone at different culture phases. The results show that hypericin contents of the cells treated with 60 to 180 nL L(-1) ozone are significantly higher than those of the control, showing that ozone exposure may stimulate hypericin synthesis. Hypericin production of the cells treated with ozone at exponential phase is higher than that of lag and stationary phase, which suggests that exponential phase cell cultures are more responsive to ozone exposure than lag and stationary phase cells. The highest hypericin production is obtained by the cells exposed to 90 nL L(-1) ozone at late exponential phase for 3 h, being about fourfold of the control.

J	Cheung, NF; Zhang, LP; Mander, R; Xu, XF; Wang, XL				Cheung, Ngai Fen; Zhang, Liping; Mander, Rosemary; Xu, Xinfen; Wang, Xiaoli			Proposed continuing professional education programme for midwives in China: New mothers' and midwives' views	NURSE EDUCATION TODAY			English	Article						Chinese midwives; Continuing education; Self-directed learning; Profile		Background: Chinese midwifery is under threat and has been denigrated, with virtually all midwives practising in the labour wards. Aims: The present study aims to inform the development of a proposed continuing professional education programme. Method: Questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews were used to investigate the views of new mothers after vaginal births and midwives. The questions focussed on midwives' education, practice and mothers' experience and knowledge of maternity care. Data were analysed using descriptive statistical techniques. Participants: Five researchers, 253 midwives and 214 women. Settings: Ten maternity units/hospitals in seven Chinese cities. Findings: Both mothers and midwives valued continuity of midwifery care. The majority of midwives were obstetric nursing educated; one-fifth had a midwifery background. A smaller minority had a maternity/childcare or obstetric education. Midwifery education is medico/nursing orientated, with only 11.6% of the curriculum midwifery-oriented. Discussion: The perceived different needs reflect the different orientations of the respondents. The programme should be structured to meet mothers' and midwives' needs, cultivate midwives' lifelong learning capacity, and encourage evidence-based practice. Conclusion: The study has shown a fundamental problem in Chinese midwifery education, in that midwives do not have access to evidence-based material. Self-directed learning with portfolio assessment is likely to prove useful for the proposed programme; this may facilitate midwives' personal/professional development to update their knowledge, understanding and competence towards their full role as midwives.

Telomere dysfunction can induce DNA damage response via key cell cycle checkpoints, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis depending on the tissue type and developmental stage of a specific stem cell compartment. Telomerase mutation and telomere shortening have been observed in a variety of hematological disorders, such as dyskeratosis congenital, aplastic anemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia, in which the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) are a major target during the pathogenesis. Moreover, telomere dysfunction is able to induce both cell-intrinsic checkpoints and environmental factors limiting the self-renewal capacity and differentiation potential of HSCs. Crucial components in the cascade of DNA damage response, including ataxia telangiectasia mutated, CHK2, p53, p21 and p16/p19(ARF), play important roles in HSC maintenance and self-renewal in the scenarios of both sufficient telomere reserve and dysfunctional telomere. Therefore, a further understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying HSC aging may help identity new therapeutic targets for stem cell-based regenerative medicine.

However, the genetic control of Cd and Zn concentrations in brown rice remains poorly understood, especially when grown in Cd-contaminated soil. In this study, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with grain Cd and Zn concentrations and Cd/Zn ratio were identified using a doubled haploid population derived from a cross between japonica JX17 and indica ZYQ8 rice cultivars. Three and two QTLs were detected for Cd and Zn concentration in brown rice, respectively. Two QTLs associated with grain Cd/Zn ratio on chromosomes 3 and 6 were initially mapped. These QTLs accounted for 10.83-41.66% of the total variance of the three traits measured. Only one common locus on chromosome 6 was found for Cd concentration and Cd/Zn ratio. The lack of co-location of the QTLs for Cd and Zn concentrations in this mapping population suggests different genetic mechanisms. In summary, our results provide insight into the genetic basis of rice grain Cd and Zn accumulation; the isolated QTLs may be useful for marker-assisted selection and identification of genes associated with Cd and Zn accumulation in rice.

Eggs incubated at the three temperatures produced morphologically different hatchlings in P. versicolor but not in P. frontalis. Snout-vent length (SVL), body mass and head width were greater in P. versicolor hatchlings from the 24 degrees C treatment than those from the 32 degrees C treatment when accounting for differences in initial egg mass, and tail length was smaller in P. versicolor hatchlings from the 24 degrees C treatment than those from the 32 degrees C treatment when accounting for differences in final egg mass. Body mass, head length, head width, tail length, fore-limb length and hind-limb length were greater in P. frontalis hatchlings than in P. versicolor hatchling when accounting for differences in initial or final egg mass. Moreover, P. frontalis females produce larger hatchlings than do P. versicolor females of the same SVL not only by laying larger eggs, but also by investing more dry materials (and thus, more energy) into the egg. Given a link between interspecific competition (and niche restriction) and morphology, it seems likely that morphological differences at hatching may facilitate the coexistence of the two lizards. The two lizards differed in embryonic thermosensitivity and water uptake by eggs during incubation, suggesting that they use different microhabitats in the area of sympatry.

Chitosan is a natural polysaccharide prepared by the N-deacetylation of chitin. It has been widely used in food and bioengineering industries, including the encapsulation of active food ingredients, in enzyme immobilization, and as a carrier for controlled drug delivery, due to its significant biological and chemical properties such as biodegradability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, and polycationicity. In this work, chitosan nanoparticles and nanofibers used to encapsulate bioactive substances and immobilize enzymes were reviewed. Preparation of chitosan nanoparticles and nanofibers, including the work achieved in our group on chitosan nanoparticles for enzyme immobilization, were also introduced. Some problems encountered with nano-structured chitosan carriers for bioactive substance encapsulation and enzyme immobilization were discussed, together with the future prospects of such systems.

To study the potential function of trehalose in development and behaviour, cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Catantops pinguis (CpiTPS) was cloned and sequenced. Results revealed that the CpiTPS cDNA sequence contains an open reading frame of 2430 nucleotides encoding a protein of 809 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 91.13 kDa and a pI value of 6.25. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that CpiTPS mRNA expression was high in the fat body and testes, ovaries, Malpighian tubules, brain, trachea, rectum, and posterior extensor of C. pinguis. Northern blotting revealed that CpiTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in first instar larvae and adults. The results demonstrate that CpiTPS is a key gene in C. pinguis development.

The related mechanism was proposed through the organic analysis and electrochemical measurements such as chronoamperometric and cyclic voltammetric measurements. The cyclic voltammogram curves of p-DCB, parachlorophenol, parahydroquinone, 2,5-dichlorophenol, and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone showed two oxidation peaks (1.8, 2.3 V (vs SCE)), (1.1, 1.9 V (vs SCE)), (0.7, 1.8 V (vs SCE)), (1.1, 2.2 V (vs SCE)), and (0.7, 1.8 V (vs SCE)), respectively. The oxidation peaks of 1,4-benzoquinone and 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone were found at the potential of 1.8 (vs SCE), coinciding with the oxidation potential of platinum. The results of cyclic voltammetric and chronoamporometric experiments suggested that both direct and indirect electrochemical oxidation processes involved the degradation of p-DCB. For the intermediates, 1,4-benzoquinone and 2,5-dichloro-p-benzoquinone underwent indirect oxidation, parahydroquinone and 2,5-dichlorohydroquinone degraded mainly by direct oxidation, and parachlorophenol and 2,5-dichlorophenol removed by both direct and indirect oxidation. Furthermore, a possible degradation scheme for the oxidation of p-DCB in acetonitrile-water solution was proposed.

Gross violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in a quasi-one-dimensional conductor	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							SPIN-CHARGE SEPARATION; LUTTINGER-LIQUID BEHAVIOR; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; TRANSPORT; CROSSOVER; BRONZE; FERMI	When charge carriers are spatially confined to one dimension, conventional Fermi-liquid theory breaks down. In such Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids, quasiparticles are replaced by distinct collective excitations of spin and charge that propagate independently with different velocities. Although evidence for spin-charge separation exists, no bulk low-energy probe has yet been able to distinguish successfully between Tomonaga-Luttinger and Fermi-liquid physics. Here we show experimentally that the ratio of the thermal and electrical Hall conductivities in the metallic phase of quasi-one-dimensional Li0.9Mo6O17 diverges with decreasing temperature, reaching a value five orders of magnitude larger than that found in conventional metals. Both the temperature dependence and magnitude of this ratio are consistent with Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. Such a dramatic manifestation of spin-charge separation in a bulk three-dimensional solid offers a unique opportunity to explore how the fermionic quasiparticle picture recovers, and over what time scale, when coupling to a second or third dimension is restored.

To study whether salicylic acid (SA) is functional in alleviating protein damage caused by H+ and Al3+ toxicities, an investigation of the antioxidant defense response regulated by SA was carried out on barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) seedlings under H+, Al3+, and combined stresses. It was found that the relative root elongation of seedlings, which grew in the solutions supplemented with SA, was significantly higher than that of seedlings without SA treatment after 24-h treatments with H+, Al3+, and combined stresses. The lesser amount of carbonylated proteins with molecular weights ranging from 14.4 to 97 kD, was accumulated in seedlings treated with SA than that in the seedlings without SA treatment. The higher activities of antioxidant enzymes and lesser content of MDA were observed in seedlings treated with SA compared with the seedlings without SA treatment. Moreover, the nitroblue tetrazolium staining of roots showed that ROS accumulation was decreased by SA treatments. This study suggested that SA could alleviate cell damage caused by H+ and Al3+ toxicities on acid soils by both activating antioxidant defense responses and reducing the contents of carbonylated proteins caused by ROS in barley seedlings.

Results showed for both runs, the feeding ratio had a more significant effect on the removal of phosphorus and nitrogen than on COD in the operating cycle. As compared to RUN I, the removal of nitrogen and phosphorus was enhanced in RUN II. In addition, the optimal feeding ratio greater than 1: 1 for SBR with dual anoxic feedings can be determined with reference to the decreasing range of ORP following the primary feeding, and the denitrification-associated ORP bending point in the second non-aeration phase.

The aim of this study was to investigate the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) in changing the permeability of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during acetaminophen (APAP)-induced ALF. Materials and methods ALF animal models were generated by administering APAP. Anti-TNF alpha-IgG was intravenously injected (100 mu g/mouse) 2 h after administration of APAP. We investigated BBB permeability with Evans blue staining, and structure with electron microscopy. Results BBB permeability increased in APAP-induced ALF mice and correlated with elevated serum TNF alpha levels. Electron microscopy of mouse brain tissues revealed tight junction (TJ) disruptions and endothelial cell shrinkage, as well as increased vesicles and vacuoles. In addition, the expression of the TJ-associated protein, occludin, was significantly decreased in APAP-induced ALF mice. Changes in BBB permeability and occludin expression could be prevented by administering anti-TNF alpha-IgG 2 h after APAP challenge. Conclusion TNF alpha plays a critical role in the development of brain edema in APAP-induced ALF. Increased BBB permeability may be due to the loss of the TJ-associated protein occludin.

They provide real-time depth estimates in conditions where passive stereo does not work well, such as on white walls. In contrast, these sensors are noisy and often perform poorly on the textured scenes where stereo excels. We explore their complementary characteristics and introduce a method for combining the results from both methods that achieve better accuracy than either alone. In our fusion framework, the depth probability distribution functions from each of these sensor modalities are formulated and optimized. Robust and adaptive fusion is built on a pixel-wise reliability weighting function calculated for each method. In addition, since time-of-flight devices have primarily been used as individual sensors, they are typically poorly calibrated. We introduce a method that substantially improves upon the manufacturer's calibration. We demonstrate that our proposed techniques lead to improved accuracy and robustness on an extensive set of experimental results.

For both 1 and 2', the Delta G double dagger value for the insertion into a Si-H bond of SiH4 is close to and only ca. 1.5 kcal mol(-1) lower than that into the Si-Cl bond of H3SiCl. Effects of in-plane substituents on the Delta G double dagger values for both Si-H and Si-CI insertion reactions are mainly electronic and electron-withdrawing substituents lower the Delta G double dagger values. Sensitivity of the Si-H insertion to the substituent effects is similar to that of the Si-Cl insertion Effects of out-of-plane substitutents are largely steric, and their sensitivity for the Si-H insertion is close to that for the Si-Cl insertion The Delta G double dagger values for the insertion reactions of sterically bulky 2 are significantly larger than those of 1. The puzzling prior observation that a bulky isolable silylene inserts into the Si-Cl bond of H(2)Sicl(2) and the Si-H bond of Me2SiHCl is explained on the basis of the substitutent effects on the insertion reactions.

(1)H NMR and ESI-MS analysis. Then PADT is employed as the curing agent for the epoxy resin of diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA) and the isothermal reaction of DGEBA/PADT is systematically investigated with differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) according to the model-fitting approach and model-free advanced isoconversional method developed by Vyazovkin. The result shows that PADT possesses the high reactivity and the reaction is autocatalytic in nature. The further reaction kinetic analysis indicates that the Kamal model can well fit the reaction rate at the reaction-controlled stage, whereas the extended Kamal model with a diffusion term can provide an excellent match throughout the isothermal reaction. On the other hand, the model-free kinetic analysis reveals a strong dependence of effective activation energy, E(alpha), on fractional conversion, alpha, which could mirror the drastic change of the reaction mechanisms, in particular, the rapid drop in E(alpha) observed in the deep-conversion regime due to the diffusion-controlled reaction kinetics. Then, a dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) of the cured DGEBA/PADT network discloses three relaxations from the low- to high-temperature range: beta(T(beta) = -34.4 degrees C), alpha' (T(alpha)' = 68.0 degrees C) and alpha (T(g) = 144.3 degrees C). Moreover, compared to linear propanediamine, PADT can much increase the crosslink density and glass temperature of the cured epoxy resin. Finally, the thermogravimetric (TG) analysis reveals PADT, like propanediamine, can impart the cured epoxy resin with the excellent thermal stability with the initial decomposition temperature as high as similar to 300 degrees C. On the basis of these experimental data, we can conclude that PADT exhibits a great potential to partially replace conventional high-volatile aliphatic-amine curing agents of low molecular weights.

Materials and methods: We screened ethanol extracts of 28 commonly used TCMs for their capability to induce cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) via PXR signalling pathway using a cell-based reporter gene assay combined with RT-PCR analysis. In addition, 34 bioactive components from these TCMs were examined for their potential to activate PXR. Results: Our observations showed that 22 ethanol extracts and 8 compounds could activate human PXR and induce CYP3A4 reporter construct in HepG2 cells. Among them, Ginkgo biloba, Ligusticum chuanxiong, Chinese angelica, prepared Rehmannia root, Epimedium brevicornum, Atractylodes macrocephala, Schisandra chinensis, Paeonia lactiflora, Ophiopogon japonicus, Polygonum multiflorum, Coptis chinensis, Artemisia scoparia, Trichosanthes kirilowii, Silybum marianum, Gardenia fruit and Lycium chinense could strongly trans-activate PXR. Moreover, ligustilide, schisantherin A, berberine hydrochloride and trans-resveratrol were identified for the first time as efficacious PXR agonists. Conclusions: Twenty-two TCM ethanol extracts and eight bioactive compounds could activate PXR signalling pathway and induce CYP3A4 reporter gene. Therefore, caution should be taken when these PXR activators are used in combination with prescribed drugs metabolized by CYP3A4. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Uniaxial tensile strain and exciton-phonon coupling in bent ZnO nanowires	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							EMISSION; GROWTH	We investigate the optical property of bent ZnO nanowires (NWs) obtained by low energy argon ion milling. At room temperature, the bent NWs demonstrates an enhanced near band edge ultraviolet emission, while the deep level green emission is totally suppressed. Temperature dependent photoluminescence measurements were carried out between 10 and 300 K for both the as-grown and the bent ZnO NWs. It is found that the emission peak energy of the bent NWs systematically shifts to lower energy compared to the as-grown NWs in the whole measured temperature range. Our results indicate that the redshift in the emission peak is related to the uniaxial tensile strain and the enhanced exciton-phonon coupling strength in the bent ZnO NWs.

The morphology development and crystal organization of the blends during heat treatment under strain were investigated using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). Equatorial scattering maxima in the SAXS patterns for samples annealed at 75 degrees C were observed before the appearance of crystal reflections. Further annealing of the samples at higher temperature induced two further discrete meridian scattering maxima. The observations indicated that homogenous oriented PLLA/PVAc film undergoes micro-phase separation first, followed by crystallization of PLLA in the PLLA-rich phase. The micro-phase separated PVAc nanodomains are aligned parallel to the stretching direction, whereas the crystallized PLLA lamellae are oriented perpendicular to the stretching direction (crystal c-axis along the stretching direction). Microphase separation was not observed when films were annealed at 120 degrees C, at which temperature the high crystallization rate of PLLA overwhelmed the micro-phase separation process.

J	Yang, CP				Yang, Chui-Ping			A proposal for implementing an n-qubit controlled-rotation gate with three-level superconducting qubit systems in cavity QED	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							QUANTUM STATES	We present a method for implementing an n-qubit controlled-rotation gate with three-level superconducting qubit systems in cavity quantum electrodynamics. The two logical states of a qubit are represented by the two lowest levels of each system while a higher energy level is used for the gate implementation. The method operates essentially by preparing a W state conditioned on the states of the control qubits, creating a single photon in the cavity mode, and then performing an arbitrary rotation on the states of the target qubit with the assistance of the cavity photon. It is interesting to note that the basic operational steps for implementing the proposed gate do not increase with the number of qubits n, and the gate operation time decreases as the number of qubits increases. This proposal is quite general, and can be applied to various types of superconducting devices in a cavity or coupled to a resonator.

Falsifying that assumption, our experimental studies show that even early stage turtle embryos move within the egg to exploit small-scale spatial thermal heterogeneity. Behavioral thermoregulation is not restricted to posthatching life and instead may be an important tactic in every life-history stage.

J	Schrade, A; Cao, ZH; Landfester, K; Ziener, U				Schrade, Anika; Cao, Zhihai; Landfester, Katharina; Ziener, Ulrich			Preparation of Raspberry-like Nanocapsules by the Combination of Pickering Emulsification and Solvent Displacement Technique	LANGMUIR			English	Article							SILICA COLLOIDAL NANOCOMPOSITES; MINIEMULSION POLYMERIZATION; SUSPENSION POLYMERIZATION; EMULSION POLYMERIZATION; SUPRACOLLOIDAL STRUCTURES; HYBRID NANOCAPSULES; NANOPARTICLES; PARTICLES; MICROSPHERES; DROPLETS	Well-defined raspberry-like nanocapsules were prepared by the combination of Pickering emulsification and solvent displacement technique by using silica particles as stabilizer and hexadecane (HD) as soft template. The formation of the capsule morphology is caused by the phase separation of poly(styrene-co-4-vinyl pyridine) (poly(St-co-4-VP)) in the droplets due to the diffusion of good solvent for the (co)polymer to the aqueous continuous phase. The size of capsules was successfully reduced from tens of micrometers in the dispersion by simply stirring to the nanorange by the employment of sonication and Ostwald ripening. The formation of silica-particles-armored nanocapsules was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS), and zeta potential measurement. The colloidal stability and particle properties, including size and morphology, depend on the amount of HD, and copolymers, the sonication time, the dispersion pH value, the type of solvent, and the copolymer composition.

J	Yang, CP				Yang, Chui-Ping			Preparation of n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger entangled states in cavity QED: An approach with tolerance to nonidentical qubit-cavity coupling constants	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							QUANTUM INFORMATION; GENERATION; CIRCUITS; SECRET; ATOMS; DOT	We propose a way for generating n-qubit Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled states with a three-level qubit system and (n - 1) four-level qubit systems in a cavity. This proposal does not require identical qubit-cavity coupling constants and thus is tolerant to qubit-system parameter nonuniformity and nonexact placement of qubits in a cavity. The proposal does not require adjustment of the qubit-system level spacings during the entire operation. Moreover, it is shown that entanglement can be deterministically generated using this method and the operation time is independent of the number of qubits. The present proposal is quite general, which can be applied to physical systems such as various types of superconducting devices coupled to a resonator or atoms trapped in a cavity.

Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane library clinical trials registry, ISI Science Citation Index, ISI Web of Knowledge and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) were searched, supplemented with manual-screening for relevant publications. Quantitative meta-analyses were performed to assess differences between abciximab groups and controls with respect to post-PCI risk of major cardiac events (MACEs), angiographic restenosis and bleeding complications. Results: 9 trials were identified, involving 2,607 diabetic patients receiving PCI for coronary artery diseases. Among those patients who underwent elective PCI or primary PCI, pooling results showed that abciximab did not significantly reduce risks of MACEs (for elective-PCI patients: RR1-month: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.60-1.44; RR1-year: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.81-1.11; for primary-PCI patients: RR1-month: 1.05, 95% CI: 0.70-1.57; RR1-year: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.80-1.21), nor all-cause mortality, re-infarction and angiographic restenosis in either group. The only beneficial effect by abciximab appeared to be a decrease 1-year TLR (target lesion revascularization) risk in elective-PCI patients (RR1-year: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.70-0.99). Moreover, occurrence of minor bleeding complications increased in elective-PCI patients treated with abciximab (RR: 2.94, 95% CI: 1.68-5.13, P<0.001), whereas major bleedings rate was similar (RR: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.27-2.57). Conclusions: Concomitant dosing of abciximab and thienopyridines provides no additional benefit among diabetic patients who underwent PCI; this conclusion, though, needs further confirmation in larger studies.

The deposited Ag atoms diffuse and aggregate on the oil surface and then Ag islands with the width of the order of 10(2)-nm form. After the samples are removed from the vacuum chamber, the immediate measurement shows that the apparent Ag coverage of the total area decays with the magnitude up to (23.0 +/- 3.8)% in few minutes. In the following two hours, the samples are kept in the ambient atmosphere and several unexpected results are detected: 1) as the topological structure of the islands evolves, the total area of each island decreases gradually and the maximum decrement measured is around 20%; 2) if an island breaks and becomes two small pieces, the total area decreases obviously; 3) however, if two small islands meet and stick together, a sudden increment of the total area is observed. These phenomena, mirroring the evolution process of the island microstructure, are resulted from both the diffusion of the atoms and the combination of the defects inside the islands.

We measured venom yield and total protein content, and examined the correlations between venom yield and hatchling size [snoutvent length (SVL) and body mass]. We also analyzed the electrophoretic profiles and enzymatic activities of venoms from hatchlings. Lyophilized venom mass was not correlated with SVL, nor with body mass. Liquid venom mass and total protein content were not correlated with body mass, but were positively correlated with SVL Venom composition, as shown in SDS-PAGE chromatograms did vary among individuals but there were biochemical differences in activity which had to be due to subtle venom composition differences between the sexes. Female hatchlings showed higher esterolytic and fibrino-genolytic activities but lower proteolytic, collagenolytic, phosphomonoesterase and fibrinolytic activities than male hatchlings. We did not find sexual differences in 5' nucleotidase, phospholipase A(2) and hyaluronidase activities, and L-amino acid oxidase activities in either female or male hatchlings. Within-clutch variation in venoms from D. acutus hatchlings should be attributed to the individual-based differences in presence or absence, and the relative amount of the protein components, and might have a genetic basis.

When compared with conventional Pickering miniemulsions and Pickering suspensions, the colloidal stability of the current systems is much more sensitive to the variation of reaction parameters such as pH, size, amount of silica particles, and content of 4-VP. The systems without coagulum were only obtained in a narrow pH range at around 9.5 and by using 12 nm silica particles as emulsifier. The formation of well-defined raspberry-like capsules was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM). The stable attachment of silica particles on the surface of hybrid particles was verified by centrifugation and subsequent characterizations, such as Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, TEM, and HRSEM. The influence of pH and weight content of HD, DVB, and 4-VP on the particle morphology was extensively investigated. Interestingly, the particle morphology strongly depends on the particle size. When compared with the organic surface-active surfactant, the formation of capsule morphology could be promoted by the application of silica particles taking advantage of their surface inactivity. The formation mechanisms of capsules/solid particles are discussed. (C) 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Phase-fluctuating superconductivity in overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4	NATURE PHYSICS			English	Article							T-C SUPERCONDUCTORS; DOPING DEPENDENCE; UNDERDOPED BI2SR2CACU2O8+DELTA; CUPRATE SUPERCONDUCTORS; NORMAL-STATE; DENSITY; TL2BA2CUO6+DELTA; EXCITATIONS; COHERENCE; FIELD	In underdoped cuprate superconductors, phase stiffness is low and long-range superconducting order is destroyed readily by thermally generated vortices (and anti-vortices), giving rise to a broad temperature regime above the zero-resistive state in which the superconducting phase is incoherent(1-4). It has often been suggested that these vortex-like excitations are related to the normal-state pseudogap or some interaction between the pseudogap state and the superconducting state(5-10). However, to elucidate the precise relationship between the pseudogap and superconductivity, it is important to establish whether this broad phase-fluctuation regime vanishes, along with the pseudogap(11), in the slightly overdoped region of the phase diagram where the superfluid pair density and correlation energy are both maximal(12). Here we show, by tracking the restoration of the normal-state magnetoresistance in overdoped La2-xSrxCuO4, that the phase-fluctuation regime remains broad across the entire superconducting composition range. The universal low phase stiffness is shown to be correlated with a low superfluid density(1), a characteristic of both underdoped and overdoped cuprates(12-14). The formation of the pseudogap, by inference, is therefore both independent of and distinct from superconductivity.	[Rourke, Patrick M.

SexHSP70, SexHSP74 and SexHSP83 cDNAs encoding the protein of 667, 685 and 717 amino acids, with the pI of 5.52, 5.75 and 5.02, respectively. Northern blotting revealed that all three SexHSP mRNAs are expressed in the fat body, mid-gut, spermary and tracheae. SexHSP70, SexHSP74and SexHSP83 mRNAs were expressed in the fat body and whole body at different levels during different developmental stages. The three SexHSP transcripts were highly expressed in the fat body on the first day of fifth instar larvae, on the fourth and seventh days of the pupa stage, and in the whole body on the initial stages of larvae. Under heat and cold shock conditions, SexHSP70 and SexHSP83 mainly functioned during heat shock and cooling and SexHSP83 also had a function in the recovery stage. SexHSP74 had important functions in short-term heat shock and recovery, as well as long-term cooling. The results revealed that long-term shocking can affect SexHSP74 and SexHSP83 expression and long-term cooling can influence SexHSP83 expression during the recovery stage. Published by Elsevier Inc.

Local polynomial Fourier transform: A review on recent developments and applications	SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Review						Local polynomial Fourier transform; Polynomial time frequency transform; SNR analysis; Reassignment method	NONSTATIONARY INTERFERENCE EXCISION; TIME-FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTIONS; QUANTITATIVE SNR ANALYSIS; INSTANTANEOUS FREQUENCY; FAST ALGORITHMS; SIGNAL; APPROXIMATION; ORDER; PERFORMANCE; SPECTROGRAM	The local polynomial Fourier transform (LPFT), as a high-order generalization of the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), has been developed and used for many different applications in recent years. This paper attempts to review previous research work on the following issues of the LPFT. Firstly, the definition, the properties of the LPFT and its relationships with other transforms are reviewed. The LPFT for multicomponent signal is then presented. The polynomial time frequency transform (PTFT), which is the maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the parameters in the LPFT, as well as its properties and fast algorithms are discussed. By comparing with the Fourier transform (FT), the STFT and the Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD), the LPFT has its superiority in obtaining improved SNRs, which can be supported by theoretical analysis and computer simulations. Furthermore, the reassignment method is combined with the LPFT and the robust LPFT to improve the concentration of the signal representation in the time-frequency domain.

Theoretical comparison is made on the 3 dB signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), achieved by the pseudo-Wigner-Ville distribution (PWVD) and the LPP, to show that the latter is important to achieve significant increase of noise margins in the Hough transform domain. The results of computer simulations are presented for the detection of mono- and multi-component ISM signals corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise and impulsive noise. It is also found that by using the time-frequency filtering, the computational complexity of the detection can be substantially reduced. Both the theoretical analysis and the simulation results show that the proposed method achieves significant performance improvement on detecting the ISM signals in very low signal-to-noise ratio environments.

The nonisothermal reactions, dynamic mechanical properties and thermal stabilities of their cured epoxy resin are comparatively investigated with DSC, DMA and TGA, respectively. The model-fitting kinetic study demonstrates that Sestak-Berggren model can generally well simulate the reaction rates, and the isoconversional kinetic analysis with the Vyazovkin method indicates the curing agents, particularly their setric hindrance and the number of the -OH groups attached, greatly affect reaction kinetic schemes. Increasing the number of the BGE substituents attached to PPIs decreases the reactivity, glass- and beta-relaxation temperatures and thermal stability of the resulting epoxy systems, yet the intensity and width of the glass relaxation increase. This work offers a unique way of preparing modified-aliphatic-polyamine curing agents, and provides an opportunity to better learn about the amine-adduct curing agents which are widely used in room-temperature-cure epoxy coatings and adhesives from these good model compounds.

Lanthanum Schiff-base complexes La(HSalen(1-4))(3) have been synthesized by metathesis reaction of anhydrous LaCl3 with Schiff-base sodium salts NaSalen. The complex La (HSalen(2))(3) with the formula of [3, 5-tBu(2)-2-(O) C6H2CH = NC6H5](3)La(THF) was characterized by X-ray diffraction, and the structure around Lanthanum center could be described as a pentagonal bipyramid. The polymerization of alkyl isocyanates was successfully carried out by using these complexes as single component catalysts, and the [OC6H2CH = NC6H5](3)La(THF) complex (La(HSalen(1))(3)) shows the highest catalytic activity to the polymerization of isocyanates. The influences of polymerization temperature, polymerization time, the concentration of catalyst and monomer, and the polymerization solvent on the polymerization of hexyl isocyanate (HIC) catalyzed by La (HSalen(1))(3) were investigated. It was found that under the polymerization conditions examined, PHIC can be prepared under -40 degrees C similar to 20 degrees C with complex La (HSalen(1))(3) as catalyst. Due to the depolymerization, higher reaction temperature leads to low polymer yield and molecular weight of PHIC obtained. Confirmed by GPC analysis, prolonging polymerization time is also in favor of depolymerization, the GPC profile of PHIC prepared after 12 h polymerization indicates the exist of dimmers and trimers. PHIC could be prepared with yield of 75.5%, number-average molecular weight (M-n) of 6.00 x 10(4) and MWD of 3.86 under the following optimum conditions: [HIC] = 3.43 mol/L, [La (HSalen(1))(3)] = 8.58 x 10(-3) mol/L, polymerization at -40 degrees C for 12 h in toluene.

We find that for the case of x = 0.5 with a Fe vacancy ordered orthorhombic superstructure, the ground state exhibits a stripelike antiferromagnetic ordering and opens a sizable band gap if the short-ranged Coulomb interaction of Fe-3d electrons is moderately strong, manifesting a possible Mott insulating state. While increasing Fe vacancies from the x = 0 side, where the band structure is similar to that of a heavily electron-doped FeSe system, the Mott localization can be driven by kinetic energy reduction, as evidenced by the band narrowing effect. Implications of this scenario in the recent experiments on TlFe2-xSe2 are discussed.

The model can also be defined on a bipartite lattice with each building block consisting of a minimal square. The noninteracting model is exactly solved and a midband gap opens at the Fermi energy in the weak interblock hopping regime. Increasing the Coulomb interaction will develop the Neel antiferromagnetic order with varying block spin moments. The metal-insulator transition with U(MI), which is smaller than the one without vacancies, occurs above themagnetic instability U(M). The emergent intermediate magnetic metal phase develops substantially in the moderate interblock hopping regime. Drastic increases in the ordered moment and the gap magnitude are observed on the verge of a tight-binding band insulator with increasing U. The implications of these results for the recently discovered (A, T1)(y)Fe(2-x)Se(2) compounds are discussed.

We find the lattice parameters and stabilities of the MX2 sheets are mainly determined by the chalcogen atoms, while the electronic properties depend on the metal atoms. The NbS2 and TaS2 sheets have comparable energetic stabilities to the synthesized MoS2 and WS2 ones. The molybdenum and tungsten dichalcogenide (MoX2 and WX2) sheets have similar lattice parameters, vibrational modes, and electronic structures. These analogies also exist between the niobium and tantalum dichalcogenide (NbX2 and TaX2) sheets. However, the NbX2 and TaX2 sheets are metals, while the MoX2 and WX2 ones are semiconductors with direct-band gaps. When the Nb and Ta atoms are doped into the MoS2 and WS2 sheets, a semiconductor-to-metal transition occurs. Comparing to the bulk compounds, these monolayer sheets have similar structural parameters and properties, but their vibrational and electronic properties are varied and have special characteristics. Our results suggest that the graphene-like MX2 sheets have potential applications in nano-electronics and nano-devices. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The photoreceptors involved in the perception of light and entrainment of the circadian clock have been well characterized in plants(3). However, how light signals are transduced from the photoreceptors to the central circadian oscillator, and how the rhythmic expression pattern of a clock gene is generated and maintained by diurnal light signals remain unclear. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, FHY3, FAR1 and HY5, three positive regulators of the phytochrome A signalling pathway, directly bind to the promoter of ELF4, a proposed component of the central oscillator, and activate its expression during the day, whereas the circadian-controlled CCA1 and LHY proteins directly suppress ELF4 expression periodically at dawn through physical interactions with these transcription-promoting factors. Our findings provide evidence that a set of light- and circadian-regulated transcription factors act directly and coordinately at the ELF4 promoter to regulate its cyclic expression, and establish a potential molecular link connecting the environmental light dark cycle to the central oscillator.

J	Lu, JB; Jiang, L; Yu, L; Sun, Q				Lu, Jianbo; Jiang, Lin; Yu, Lin; Sun, Que			Local Factors Determine Plant Community Structure on Closely Neighbored Islands	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK; METACOMMUNITY STRUCTURE; INTERCONNECTED PONDS; SPATIAL PROCESSES; SPECIES RICHNESS; BETA-DIVERSITY; MODEL SYSTEMS; ECOLOGY; DISPERSAL; MATRICES	Despite the recent popularity of the metacommunity concept, ecologists have not evaluated the applicability of different metacommunity frameworks to insular organisms. We surveyed 50 closely spaced islands in the Thousand-Island Lake of China to examine the role of local (environmental) and regional (dispersal) factors in structuring woody plant assemblages (tree and shrub species) on these islands. By partitioning the variation in plant community structure into local and regional causes, we showed that local environmental conditions, specifically island morphometric characteristics, accounted for the majority of the variation in plant community structure among the studied islands. Spatial variables, representing the potential importance of species dispersal, explained little variation. We conclude that one metacommunity framework-species sorting-best characterizes these plant communities. This result reinforces the idea that the traditional approach of emphasizing the local perspective when studying ecological communities continues to hold its value.

In the present study, we hypothesized that protein-energy malnutrition may be present in hospitalized chronic stroke patients complicated with pulmonary infection. The results revealed that body protein and fat stores were significantly depleted in stroke patients with pulmonary infection. Protein-energy malnutrition was present in 12 of 27 patients with pulmonary infection. In comparison, only eight of 42 stroke patients without pulmonary infection exhibited protein-energy malnutrition. A significantly higher prevalence of protein-energy malnutrition was found in the pulmonary infection group, suggesting that protein-energy malnutrition is more likely to be present in hospitalized chronic stroke patients with pulmonary infection.

The oil-based nanofluids were prepared with the lipophilic Cu nanoparticles. The transport properties, viscosity, and thermal conductivity of the nanofluids have been measured. The viscosities and thermal conductivities of the nanofluids with the surface-modified nanoparticles have higher values than the base fluids do. The composition has more significant effects on the thermal conductivity than on the viscosity. It is valuable to prepare an appropriate oil-based nanofluid for enhancing the heat-transfer capacity of a hydrophobic system. The effects of adding Cu nanoparticles on the thermal oxidation stability of the fluids were investigated by measuring the hydroperoxide concentration in the Cu/kerosene nanofluids. The hydroperoxide concentrations are observed to be clearly lower in the Cu nanofluids than in their base fluids. Appropriate amounts of metal nanoparticles added in a hydrocarbon fuel can enhance the thermal oxidation stability.

Unexpectedly, the biosynthetic gene cluster of the aminocoumarin antibiotic rubradirin was found to contain three genes for putative acyladenylate-forming enzymes of aminocoumarin biosynthesis and conjugation. We expressed, purified, and investigated these three proteins. Orf4 (55 kDa) was shown to be an active aminocoumarin acyl ligase. RubF6 (56 kDa) was inactive, but could be converted into an active enzyme by site-directed mutagenesis. RubC1 (138 kDa) was shown to be a unique bifunctional enzyme, comprising an aminocoumarin acyl ligase, and tyrosine-adenylation and peptidyl-carrier domains. This natural hybrid enzyme is unique among known proteins. A hypothesis is proposed as to how such an enzyme could offer a particularly effective machinery for aminocoumarin antibiotic biosynthesis.

Crystal structures and theoretical calculations showed that the new silole molecules had higher conjugation than 2,5-diarylsiloles. They possessed low HOMO and LUMO energy levels due to the electron-withdrawing effect of the triphenylsilylethynyl groups. Cyclic voltammetry analysis revealed low electron affinities, which same conditions. All of the silole molecules possessed high thermal stability. Although, their solutions were weakly emissive, their nanoparticle suspensions and thin films emitted intense blue-green light upon photoexcitation, demonstrating a novel feature of aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Polarized emissions were observed in the silole crystals. The addition of solvents, which did not dissolve the silole molecules, into silole-containing solutions caused self-assembly of the molecules, which produced macroscopic fibrils with strong light emissions.

PEO-b-PS provided the nanocomposite lamellar structure with a slightly increased long period. Lamellar layers of the nanocomposite block copolymer were oriented parallel to the film plane. Fully exfoliated clay platelets were localized mostly in the aligned PEO layers, and all platelets were found to be parallel to the interface between PEO and PS layers. PEO crystals in the nanocomposite were oriented with the c-axis perpendicular to the phase-separated layers. The orientation function degree of the PEO crystals within the nanocomposite was lower than that of the crystals within the neat block copolymer.

J	Cao, C; Dai, JH				Cao Chao; Dai Jian-Hui			Electronic Structure of KFe2Se2 from First-Principles Calculations	CHINESE PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY	Electronic structures and magnetic properties for iron-selenide KFe2Se2 are studied by first-principles calculations. The ground state is collinear antiferromagnetic with calculated 2.26 mu(B) magnetic moment on Fe atoms; and the J(1) and J(2) coupling strengths are calculated to be 0.038 eV and 0.029 eV. The states around E-F are dominated by the Fe 3d orbitals which hybridize noticeably to the Se 4p orbitals. While the band structure of KFe2Se2 is similar to a heavily electron-doped BaFe2As2 or FeSe system, the Fermi surface of KFe2Se2 is much closer to the FeSe system since the electron sheets around M are symmetric with respect to x-y exchange. These features, as well as the absence of Fermi surface nesting, suggest that the parent KFe2Se2 could be regarded as an electron doped FeSe system with possible local moment magnetism.

However, so far little has been known about genetic diversity and conservation genetics of this species. Understanding of the genetic variation and relationships in cultivars of C. ensifolium is a prerequisite for development of future germplasm conservation and cultivar improvement. Here we report assessment of genetic variations in C. ensifolium cultivars using the DNA fingerprinting technique of inter-simple sequence repeats (ISSR). A total of 239 ISSR loci were identified and used for evaluation of genetic variation with a selection of 19 ISSR primers. Among these ISSR loci, 99.16% were polymorphic with wide genetic variation as shown by Nei's gene diversity (H = 0.2431) among 85 tested cultivars. ISSR fingerprinting profiles showed that each cultivar had its characteristic DNA pattern, indicating unequivocal cultivar identification at molecular level. Eighteen cultivar-specific ISSR markers were identified in seven cultivars. The cultivar Sijiwenhan was confirmed as hybrid by four ISSR primers. Several cultivars with same name but different geographical origins were distinguished based on their ISSR profiles. A dendrogram generated with ISSR markers could group 73 of 85 cultivars into four major clusters. Further analysis of ISSR variation revealed that about 69% of total genetic variation in this species is due to genetic divergence inside geographical groups. Our results suggest that both germplasm collection and in situ conservation are important for future planning of C. ensifolium species conservation.

J	Zhou, XL; Wu, Y				Zhou, Xiaolin; Wu, Yan			Sharing losses and sharing gains: Increased demand for fairness under adversity	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						The ultimatum game; Fairness; Loss sharing; Gain sharing; Implicit association test; IAT	IMPLICIT ASSOCIATION TEST; ULTIMATUM; COMPETITION; PUNISHMENT; GAMES	There is ample experimental evidence showing that people have a strong preference for equity in wealth allocation and social interaction. Although the behavior of gain sharing and responses to (un)fairness in allocation of wealth has been extensively investigated in studies employing economic exchange games, few studies have focused on how people respond to an unfair division of loss between individuals. In this study we developed a new variant of the ultimatum game and examined the participants' reactions to (un)fairness in both gain and loss sharing. Results from three experiments showed that the rejection rates to unfair offers were generally higher in the loss than in the gain domain. Moreover, participants were inclined to associate loss with "unfair" and gain with "fair", with stronger associations leading to higher rejection rates in the ultimatum game. Furthermore, in subjective rating, unfair offers were perceived as being more unfair in the loss than in the gain domain. These results demonstrate an increased demand for fairness under adversity and the importance of justice in liability sharing. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

However, the source of elicitor-triggered NO generation in plant cells remains largely unknown. To investigate the origin of elicitor-triggered NO, we examined nitrate reductase (NR) activities and the expression levels of NIA1 and NIA2 genes of Camptotheca acuminata cells treated with PB90, a protein elicitor from Phytophthora boehmeriae. The data show that PB90 treatment stimulates NR activity and induces upregulation of NIA1 but does not affect NIA2 expression in the cells. Pretreatment of the cells with NR inhibitors tungstate and Gln abolishes not only the fungal elicitor-triggered NR activities but also the PB90-induced NO generation. Treatment of PB90 enhances camptothecin contents of the cells, suggesting that the fungal elicitor might stimulate camptothecin biosynthesis. Furthermore, application of tungstate and Gln suppresses the fungal elicitor-induced camptothecin accumulation of the cells and the suppression of NR inhibitors on PB90-induced camptothecin production can be reversed by NO via its donor sodium nitroprusside. Together, the results suggest that NIA1 is sensitive to PB90 and the fungal elicitor-induced upregulation of NIA1 may lead to higher NR activity. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that NR is involved in the fungal elicitor-triggered NO generation and the fungal elicitor induces camptothecin production of C. acuminata cells dependently on NR-mediated NO generation.

A series of Cinchona alkaloid-derived organocatalysts with different functional groups were prepared and used in the aza-Michael and retro-aza-Michael reaction. There was an interesting finding that a complete reversal of stereoselectivity when a benzoyl group was introduced to the cinchonine and cinchonidine. The chirality amplification vs. time proceeds in the quinine-derived organocatalyst containing silicon-based bulky group, QN-TBS, -catalyzed aza-Michael reaction under solvent-free conditions. In addition, we have demonstrated for the first time that racemization was occurred in suitable solvents under mild conditions due to retro-aza-Michael reaction of the Michael adduct of aniline with chalcone. These indicate the equilibrium of retro-aza-Michael reaction and aza-Michael reaction produce the happening of chirality amplification in aza-Michael reaction and racemization via retro-aza-Michael reaction under different conditions, which would be beneficial to the development of novel chiral catalysts for the aza-Michael reactions.

Dichotomy in the T-linear resistivity in hole-doped cuprates	PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY A-MATHEMATICAL PHYSICAL AND ENGINEERING SCIENCES			English	Article						superconductors; cuprates; phase diagram; electrical resistivity	NORMAL-STATE; FERMI-SURFACE; TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; DOPING DEPENDENCE; TRANSPORT; SCATTERING; PSEUDOGAP; TL2BA2CUO6+DELTA	From analysis of the in-plane resistivity rho(ab)(T) of La2-xSrxCuO4, we show that normal state transport in overdoped cuprates can be delineated into two regimes in which the electrical resistivity varies approximately linearly with temperature. In the low-temperature limit, the T-linear resistivity extends over a very wide doping range, in marked contrast to expectations from conventional quantum critical scenarios. The coefficient of this T-linear resistivity scales with the superconducting transition temperature T-c, implying that the interaction causing this anomalous scattering is also associated with the superconducting pairing mechanism. At high temperatures, the coefficient of the T-linear resistivity is essentially doping independent beyond a critical doping p(crit) = 0.19 at which the ratio of the two coefficients is maximal. Taking our cue from earlier thermodynamic and photoemission measurements, we conclude that the opening of the normal-state pseudogap at p(crit) is driven by the loss of coherence of anti-nodal quasi-particles at low temperatures.

In this study, two missense mutations (T221C and A448G) were detected in porcine UCP3 gene. Genotype frequencies were analyzed using polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) in eight pig breeds (n = 384). The results revealed that Chinese native breeds had fixed genotype CC at T221C polymorphic loci. Allele G at the A448G loci has higher frequency than allele A in all pure breeds, except for Pietrain. Association analysis between variants and fatness traits was carried out in a PietrainxJinhua F2 population (n = 274). The results showed that two single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) were significantly associated with intramuscular fat content (p = 0.023 and p = 0.000, respectively). These results indicated that single nucleotide polymorphism of UCP3 gene is potentially associated with fatness traits in pig.

We find that both the n-type and p-type substitutions can cause the semiconductor-to-metal transitions in graphane sheets. The substitutional B and Al atoms induce magnetic moments of nearby carbon atoms. Moreover, the B-substituted graphane sheets have the concentration-dependent magnetic properties, while the Al-substituted ones exhibit robust half-metallic behaviors. Our studies demonstrate that the substituted graphane sheets have potential applications in nanoelectronics and spintronics. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

Poly-beta-cyclodextrin (Poly-beta-CD) was used as an additive in the running buffer to improve the separation of three analytes. The conditions for CE separation, ECL detection and effect of Poly-beta-CD were investigated in detail. The three beta-blockers with very similar structures were well separated and detected under the optimum conditions. The linear ranges of the standard solution for atenolol and esmolol were 2.5-125 mu mol/L with a detection limit (S/N=3) of 0.5 mu mol/L, and for metoprolol was 0.5-25 mu mol/L with a detection limit of 0.1 mu mol/L. For three beta-blockers from spiked aqueous and urine samples, the accuracy and precision including intraday and interday experiments were performed by calculating the recovery, the relative standard deviations of the ECL intensity and the migration time, respectively. The developed method was applied to the determination of metoprolol content in commercial pharmaceutical, and the analytical results are in good agreement with the nominal value with recoveries in the range of 98.7-105%. The proposed method was also applied to the monitoring of pharmacokinetics for metoprolol in human body. Crown Copyright (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) images show that the trialdehyde derivative forms lamellar structures. By the addition of active reactant, 5-aminoisophthalic acid, it is found that the structure of the adlayer can be transformed from lamellar to hexagonal structure as was expected. The structural formation of molecular networks is attributed to the condensation reaction between aldehyde and amine. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the observation of structural transformation at the solid/liquid interface due to the more stable adsorption of the triimine product than that of the trialdehyde derivative.

The reducing ability of dysprosium metal is solvent-dependent. Dysprosium metal, which requires neither any additive nor pretreatment, can promote the cross-coupling of acyl chlorides in DMF or DEF to give amides in good yields. When the reaction was performed in N,N-dimethylacetamide, the reductive self-coupling reaction of aroyl chloride took place smoothly and afforded the diaryl-substituted acetylenes in moderate to good yield.

All the porous C, BN, and BC2N sheets with one-hydrogen passivation exhibit direct-band-gap semiconducting behaviors. The porous BN sheet has a larger band gap than the porous C one, whereas the porous BC2N sheets have variable band gaps depending on the atomic arrangements of B, C, and N atoms. The stablest conformation of porous BC2N sheets is composed of C and BN hexagons, whereas with two-hydrogen passivation, it becomes the structure containing continuous BN and interrupted C zigzag lines. Furthermore, due to the sp(3) hybridization of the edge atoms, the two-hydrogen passivation induces the changes of band gaps as well as direct-to-indirect band-gap transitions in all the porous sheets. We also find that it is more Possible to form the porous C and BC2N structures in experiments than the porous BN ones. Our studies demonstrate that the porous C, BN, and BC2N sheets band engineering by different hydrogen passivations.

However, it has been suggested that exposure to nanoparticles may be a risk for the development of vascular diseases due to injury and dysfunction of the vascular endothelium. Therefore, in the present study, the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of multi-wall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were evaluated. Optical and transmission electronic microscopy (TEM) study showed that MWCNTs were able to enter cells rapidly, distribute in the cytoplasm and intracellular vesicles and induce morphological changes. Exposure to MWCNTs reduced the viability of HUVECs, and induced apoptosis in HUVECs. Furthermore. MWCNTs could cause DNA damage as indicated by the formation of gamma H2AX foci. MWCNTs also affected cellular redox status, e.g., increasing intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, as well as altering superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) levels. On the other hand, the free radical scavenger N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) preincubation can inhibit the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of MWCNTs. Taken together, these results demonstrated that MWCNTs could induce cytotoxic and genotoxic effects in HUVECs, probably through oxidative damage pathways. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we propose a formal analyzing approach to context-specific behavioral equivalence for Web services. We first formalize the behavior of a Web service by pi-calculus. Based on the formalization, we introduce a notion of behavioral equivalence for Web services by considering the context of a service, rather than the behavioral derivation of a service itself following the classical notion of strong and weak simulation. Furthermore, we propose a derivative approach to analyzing the behavioral equivalence for Web services according to the given notion. The illustrating example shows that the proposed analysis of behavioral equivalence for Web services provides a firm ground for enhanced behavior-aware discovery and substitution.

We collected eggs from Zhejiang (northern) and Hainan (southern) populations, and incubated them at constant temperatures of 26 degrees C and 30 degrees C. Hatchling body mass and early growth were determined in a common garden experiment to identify the intrinsic between-population difference in these life-history traits. Relative to egg size, hatchling body mass was larger in the Zhejiang population than in the Hainan population. Hatchlings from the Hainan population grew faster than their counterparts from the Zhejiang population. Growth rates differed between the sexes in the Hainan population (females > males), but not in the Zhejiang population. These results suggest that I) eggs from the Zhejiang population might contain more energy and thus produce larger hatchings than eggs of the same size from the Hainan population, and 2) the intrinsic fast growth rate of hatchlings could be the reason for the larger adult size observed in the Hainan population.

FLAG LEAF; YIELD TRAITS; QTL ANALYSIS; GENE ACTIONS; POPULATION; SINK	Validation and dissection of a QTL region for leaf traits in rice which has been reported in a number of independent studies were conducted. Three sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) were originated from a residual heterozygous line derived the indica cross Zhenshan 97B/Milyang 46. They were overlapping and totally covered a 4.2-Mb heterogenous region extending from RM4923 to RM402 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6. Each NIL set consisted of 10 maternal lines and 10 paternal lines. They were measured for the length, width, perimeter and area of the top three leaves and the number of spikelets per panicle, number of grains per panicle and grain weight per panicle. In NIL sets 6-4 and 6-7, differing in intervals RM4923-RM225 and RM19410-RM6119, respectively, significant variations with the enhancing alleles from the female parent ZS97 were shown for the length, perimeter and area except for the area of the third leaf from top in 6-4, but the effects were lower in 6-4 than in 6-7. No significant effects were detected for the three traits in the remaining NIL set. It was shown that flag leaf length (FLL) is the primary target of the QTLs detected. Two QTLs for FLL linked in repulsion phase were resolved, of which qFLL6.2 located in the 1.19-Mb interval RM3414-RM6917 had a major effect with the enhancing allele from Zhenshan 97B, and qFLL6.1 located in the 946.8-kb interval RM19350-RM19410 had a smaller effect with the enhancing allele from Milyang 46. The two QTLs also exerted pleiotropic effects on the yield traits.

Sleep-related predictors of quality of life in the elderly versus younger heart failure patients: A questionnaire survey	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF NURSING STUDIES			English	Article						Daily excess sleepiness; Elderly; Heart failure; Night sleep quality; Quality of life	CARDIOVASCULAR-DISEASE; DAYTIME SLEEPINESS; GENERAL-POPULATION; CHINESE VERSION; INSOMNIA; MORTALITY; SYMPTOMS; SCALE; INDEX	Background: Research has indicated that sleep disorders reduce the quality of life of heart failure patients. Objectives: To investigate quality of sleep, and the impact of poor sleep on quality of life among elderly versus younger heart failure patients. Design: A two-group, cross-sectional study. Setting: A community teaching hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. Participants: Voluntarily self-enrolled heart failure patients who did not have sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome. Methods: There were126 elderly and 67 young participants filled out five questionnaires (1) demographic information and current health status; (2) the Chinese Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; (3) the Chinese Epworth Sleepiness Scale, and (4) the short form (SF)-36 Taiwanese version. The major statistical procedures applied in this study were t-test, analysis of variance, Pearson's correlation, and a stepwise multiple linear regression. A p-value of <0.05 was adopted as significant. Results: The prevalence of insomnia was 44.4% for the elderly group and 31.4% for the younger group. The top three prevalence sleep-disturbing events were: nocturia, long sleep latency, and early wake-up. In the elderly group, nocturnal dyspnea and long sleep latency were significant determinants of the mental (R-2 = 0.23) and physical components (R-2 = 0.21) of quality of life. In the young group, nocturnal dyspnea was a significant determinant of the mental component of quality of life (R-2 = 0.15), and early wake-up was a significant determinant of the physical component of quality of life (R-2 = 0.15). Conclusion: The sleep disorder of heart failure patients is disease-specific rather than a matter of age. The prevalence of insomnia of young heart failure patients was higher than that of the healthy elderly. The major determinants of poor night sleep quality in the elderly group were dyspnea and long sleep latency, and in the younger group, these were dyspnea and early wake-up. Those also were significant determinants of quality of life of the heart failure patients. Implications for nursing practice: Since the sleep-related predictors of quality of life were different in the elderly versus younger heart failure patients, to identify the insomnia factors individually and to provide guidance of appropriate usage of sleep medications and other methods to promote sleep should be considered.

To develop a simple and efficient system for the preparation of small DNA fragments, a novel PCR amplification pattern was designed and tested, of which targeted small DNA fragments were amplified in groups as a unit with a specific synthetic vector as template DNA. The amplified units can be different dependent on the identities of the employed primers and give out variable combinations of small DNA fragments through complete or partial restrictive digestion with EcoRI. The novel pattern made the PCR amplification of small DNA fragments not only more efficient but also more economic than ever before. The tandem PCR pattern, as the most efficient and high throughput method for small DNA fragment preparation, has wide application for the production of various DNA markers and a good complementation to the larger DNA fragment preparation by complex synthetic vector fermentation.

In this paper, the toxicities of the chiral herbicide dichlorprop (DCPP) and its complexes with chitosan molecules (DCPP-CS) and chitosan nanoparticles (DCPP-NP) to two different green algae were determined and compared. The inhibition rates of DCPP, DCPP-CS and DCPP-NP were determined at 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, 168 h, and the results show that (S)-DCPP was more toxic to Chlorella vulgaris than (R)-DCPP, while the (R)-DCPP was more toxic to Scenedesmus obliquus than (S)-DCPP. The study also found that the chiral selectivity of DCPP to Chlorella vulgaris and Scenedesmus obliquus could be changed when DCPP was complexed with chitosan molecules (CS) or chitosan nanoparticles (NP). For Chlorella vulgaris, the order of inhibition was (R)-DCPP-CS > (S)-DCPP-CS and (R)-DCPP-NP > (S)-DCPP-NP; for Scenedesmus obliquus, the order was (S)-DCPP-CS > (R)-DCPP-CS and (S)DCPP-NP > (R)-DCPP-NP. This phenomenon suggests that the enantioselective behaviors of chiral compounds might shift when interactions with other chiral receptors coexist in different biological environments. Additionally, chitosan molecules and chitosan nanoparticles also showed different toxicities, which could be ascribed to the difference in the physicochemical properties between CS and NP or the differences in the cell walls of the two fresh water green algae.

Effects of cross-linking time and cross-linker content on the activity, thermal stability and characteristics of enzyme aggregates were examined carefully. It was observed that when the content of p-benzoquinone was 5 mM and amount of BSA was 125% of that of lipase (w/w), the specific activity of cross-linked co-aggregates of lipase and BSA was 79.8 U mg(-1), 2.44-fold of that of cross-linked enzyme aggregates of lipase without BSA. Moreover, after heat treatment for 96 h at 50 degrees C, the CLEAs prepared with this facile routine kept 75.18% of their initial activity, 5.01-fold more than that of the just CLEAs using glutaraldehyde. Furthermore, BSA macromolecules in lipase CLEAs enhanced the catalytic efficiency of free and just lipase CLEAs without BSA by 1.45 and 2.83 times, respectively. The proposed cross-linking technique would rank among the potential strategies for efficiently preparing robust and thermo-stable enzyme aggregates.

This study was conducted to elucidate the action mechanisms of pymetrozine on the feeding behaviour of the planthopper. RESULTS: The activity test showed that pymetrozine primarily functioned as an antifeedant that caused starvation and death in N. lugens, rather than having neurotoxicity. Pymetrozine-treated insects died at a significantly slower speed than insects treated with starvation. Electrical penetration graph (EPG) data indicated that pymetrozine significantly increased the duration of non-probing periods and had a strong inhibition to phloem ingestion. The inhibition was strongly dose dependent, resulting in a complete suppression of the activity in the phloem region when the pymetrozine concentration was increased to 400 mg L-1. Starvation caused by inhibition of phloem ingestion might be a major toxicity mechanism of pymetrozine. EPG data also showed that pymetrozine had no significant effect on stylet movement and duration of xylem sap ingestion. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that pymetrozine disturbed the feeding behaviour of N. lugens mainly by increasing the non-probe period and inhibiting phloem ingestion. The inhibition resulted in a slow death similar to starvation.

Fe-based superconductivity with T-c=31 K bordering an antiferromagnetic insulator in (Tl,K) FexSe2	EPL			English	Article							IRON; MOSSBAUER	(Tl,K)FexSe2 single crystals were first successfully synthesized with the Bridgeman method. The physical properties are characterized by electrical resistivity, magnetic susceptibility and Hall coefficient. We found that the (Tl,K)FexSe2 (1.30 <= x <= 1.65) compounds show an antiferromagetic (AFM) insulator behavior, which may be associated with the Fe-vacancy ordering in the crystals. While in the 1.70 <= x < 1.78 crystals, superconductivity (SC) coexists with an insulating phase. As Fe content further increases, the bulk SC with T-c = 31K (and a T-c(onset) as high as 40 K) appears in the 1.78 <= x <= 1.88 crystals. Our discovery represents the first Fe-based high-temperature superconductivity (HTSC) at the verge of an AFM insulator.

Here, we report that treatment of PB90 stimulates hypericin production and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation in Hypericum perforatum L. cells and demonstrate that H2O2 is essential for PB90-induced hypericin production. To further study the source of PB90-triggered H2O2, we have investigated activities of plasma membrane NADPH oxidase in Hypericum perforatum L. cells subjected to PB90 treatment. It is revealed that treatment of the cells with PB90 significantly increases NADPH oxidase activity. NADPH oxidase inhibitors suppress not only the PB90-stimulated NADPH oxidase activity but also the PB90-triggered H2O2 generation and PB90-induced hypericin production, showing that NADPH oxidase is involved in PB90-triggered H2O2 generation and hypericin production. Moreover, the suppression of NADPH oxidase inhibitors on PB90-induced hypericin production can be reversed by H2O2, although H2O2 per se has no effects on hypericin production of the cells. Together, the data demonstrate that PB90 may induce hypericin production of H. perforatum cells through the NADPH oxidase-mediated H2O2 signaling pathway.

CV and UV-Vis spectra showed that an intramoleular interaction existed between the electron-rich moiety TTF and electron-deficient moiety polyethynylcarbazole of the polymers. A strong fluorescence quench (ca. 99%) could be observed, compared to the polyethynylene-carbazole without TTF units, which could be ascribed to the photo-induced electron transfer (PET) interaction from TTF moiety to the polyethynylene-carbazole backbone. The observed onset decomposition temperatures (T-d) for P1-P3 varied from 256 to 298 degrees C. The polymers mentioned above exhibited good thermal properties and higher conductivity (neutral conductivity similar to 7-11 x 10(-7) S cm(-1); doped conductivity similar to 6-11 x 10(-4) S cm(-1)).

There are potential interactive effects between PBDEs and PCBs, as these compounds share similar structures. The developmental neurotoxicity of 2, 2', 4, 4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (PBDE-47) and the interaction of PBDE-47 with 2, 2', 4, 4', 5, 5'-hexachlorobipheny (PCB153) were investigated herein, as the dominant congener forms of PBDEs and PCBs, respectively. SD rats were exposed to a single oral dose of PBDE-47 (1, 5, and 10 mu g/g) and/or PCB153 (5 mu g/g) on post-natal day (PND) 10. Concentrations of PBDE-47, triiodothyronine (T-3), thyroxine (T-4), and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in serum; organ-to-body weight ratios; as well as long-term learning and memory were measured in 2-month-old rats. The present study found that some doses of PBDE-47 decreased the organ-to-body weight ratios of the thyroid and uterus, decreased the concentration of T4 in serum, and increased the organ-to-body weight ratio of the ovaries (p < 0.05). PCB153 could increase the action of PBDE-47 during combined exposure, but this interaction was not found between PBDE-47 and PCB153. In a Morris water maze experiment, the latency periods were significantly prolonged and time ratios were obviously depressed in all PBDE-47-treated groups compared to the control (p < 0.05); furthermore, significant interactions between PBDE-47 and PCB153 were observed (p < 0.05). In conclusion, PBDE-47 may depress thyroid development as well as the long-term learning and memory capabilities in adult rats exposed to PBDE-47 on PND 10. PCB153 can interact with PBDE-47, resulting in an increase in developmental neurotoxicity.

The elongation-at-break and water vapor transmission rate of curdlan/chitosan blended membranes were substantially improved when the temperature was high (90 degrees C) due to curdlan gel formation and the interaction between the hydroxyl groups of curdlan and the amino groups of chitosan. This was confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The membranes were further investigated for their miscibility between the two components using differential scanning calorimetric measurements, dynamic mechanical analysis, optical microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. High reaction temperatures (90 degrees C) and low curdlan contents caused better interactions between components, and allowed membranes to be prepared with higher storage moduli and lower water absorption rates. The 4 bacteria strains were chosen as target bacteria using the optical density method to prove the antibacterial activity of the membranes obtained. The resulting curdlan/chitosan membranes exhibited outstanding antibacterial activity. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We solve the exact master equation to find the exact quantum state of the device, from which the changes of the electron coherence through the magnetic flux in the nonequilibrium transport processes is obtained explicitly. We find that the relative phase between the two charge states of the degenerate double dot localizes to pi/2 or -pi/2 for all different magnetic fluxes, due to decoherence. This nontrivial decoherence process can be manifested in the measurable occupation numbers.

Methods: Four miRNAs (miR-221, miR-222, miR-21 and miR-224) related to HCC were selected in the present study. Serum miRNA expression was investigated in 46 HCC patients and 20 healthy normal controls by using real-time PCR technique, and then correlations between miR-221 expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC patients were evaluated. Results: The four miRNAs were found to be differentially overexpressed in HCC serum samples, and high level of miR-221 expression was correlated with tumor size (P < 0.001), cirrhosis (P = 0.003) and tumor stage (P = 0.016). In addition, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the overall survival rate of the high miR-221 expression group (27.6%) was significantly lower than that of the low miR-221 expression group (62.3%, P < 0.05). Conclusions: Serum miR-221, upregulated in HCC, can provide predictive significance for prognosis of HCC patients. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We propose an extensible framework containing a series of criteria for the behavioral equivalence of services and explore the implications of relations among them. The proposed criteria can be adapted to different requirements in various scenarios. When one formalizes services with pi-calculus, the behavioral equivalence for Web services can be analyzed automatically in a derivative way according to the proposed notions.

J	Shao, ZH				Shao, Zuhua			Enhanced Certificate-Based Encryption from pairings	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article							GENERIC CONSTRUCTION; SIGNATURE; SECURITY	In Certificate-Based Encryption, introduced by Gentry, a certificate, -or, more generally, a signature-acts not only as a certificate but also as a decryption key. However, the security model of Gentry's scheme relies on an unrealistic assumption, where the adversary must reveal its partial private key to the challenger in attack games. In this paper, we propose an enhanced Certificate-Based Encryption scheme from pairings in the chosen-key model. We show that this scheme is semantically secure against adaptive chosen ciphertext attacks in the random oracle model under the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption. The new scheme not only solves the key escrow problem and the secure channel problem to be inherent in Identity-Based Encryption schemes, but also eliminates the unrealistic assumption of Gentry scheme. Moreover, the proposed scheme is more efficient and secure than the existing related works. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

First, we study the modulational instability (MI) of the SB system. As a result, the general dispersion relation be tween the frequency and the wave number of the modulating perturbations is derived, and thus a number of possible MI regions are identified. Then two classes of exact travelling wave solutions are obtained expressed in the general forms. Several explicit examples are presented.

Effects of various factors on enzyme activity were investigated, such as glutaraldehyde concentration, cross-linking time, enzyme amount, pH, and immobilized time. The immobilized conditions were optimized by orthogonal experiments. Characterizations of immobilized nuclease p1 were also evaluated. Through orthogonal optimization, optimal immobilization conditions were as follows: glutaraldehyde mass fraction w = 0.20 %, enzyme amount 6.0 mL (enzyme activity 2160 U), immobilized time 4.0 h and pH 5.8. Optimal pH of immobilized enzyme was 5.8. Optimal temperature of immobilized enzyme was 80 degrees C. Thermal, operational and storage stabilities of the enzyme were improved after it was immobilized on chitosan micro-spheres. Michaelis constant K-m of immobilized enzyme was 96.58 mg mL(-1) by Lineweaver-Burk plot at 70 degrees C.	[Yi, Y.; Chen, J. S.; Xiong, W. Y.; Ying, G.

The morphology, oral infraciliature, and morphogenesis of the species were studied using living and protargol-impregnated specimens. Zooids of E. chlorelligerum are 160-230 x 50-60 mu m in vivo, and characterized by green-colored endoplasm containing symbiotic algae. The oral infraciliature presents a well-developed filamentous reticulum linked to the circular fiber of the cytostome; the outer two rows of P3 extend adstomally over P1 and usually enfold it. During binary fission, one daughter cell inherits most part of the old buccal apparatus and the reorganized haplokinety and germinal kinety (Hk' and G'), and new buccal apparatus of the other daughter cell is mostly developed from the original germinal kinety (G) and haplokinety (Hk): new peniculi 2, 3 (2P2, 2P3), new haplokinety (2Hk), and new germinal kinety (2G) are formed from G, while the new peniculus 1 (2P1) and its peristomial extention (2Pk) originate from Hk. The epistomial membrane can be observed until the two sets of buccal apparatus begin to separate from each other.

The latter is found to be more suitable for the effect of an electrode's bandwidth on quantum transport and noise spectrum for weak system-reservoir coupling, as calibrated with the exact results in the absence of a Coulomb interaction. We further analyze the effect of the Coulomb interaction on the noise spectrum of the transport current through quantum dot systems, and show that the realistic finite Coulomb interaction and finite bandwidth are manifested only with the non-Markovian treatment. We demonstrate a number of non-Markovian characteristics of the shot noise spectrum, including that which is due to finite bandwidth and that which is sensitive to and enhanced by the magnitude of the Coulomb interaction.

J	Zhao, Q; Liu, HX; Luo, LG; Ji, XA				Zhao, Qun; Liu, Hong-Xia; Luo, Lai-Gao; Ji, Xiang			Comparative population genetics and phylogeography of two lacertid lizards (Eremias argus and E. brenchleyi) from China	MOLECULAR PHYLOGENETICS AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Eremias lizards; Mitochondrial DNA; Cytochrome b; Phylogeography; Vicariance; Population genetics	CLIMATIC OSCILLATIONS; FAMILY LACERTIDAE; DNA; DISPERSAL; SEQUENCES; REFUGIA; FRAGMENTATION; CONSEQUENCES; PHYLOGENY; GROWTH	Eremias argus and Eremias brenchleyi are lacertid lizards that are sympatric throughout the distribution of E. brenchleyi. We sequenced partial mitochondrial DNA from cytochrome (cyt) b gene for 106 individuals of E. argus from nine localities, and for 45 individuals of E. brenchleyi from five localities, in central and northern parts of North China. We determined 53 cyt b haplotypes from the E. argus samples, and 27 cyt b haplotypes from the E. brenchleyi samples. Only E. brenchleyi had followed a stepping-stone model of dispersal. Partitioned Bayesian phylogenetic analysis reveals that E. argus and E. brenchleyi are reciprocally monophyletic, and the divergence time between the two species was dated to about 4.1 +/- 1.2 million years ago. Geographical structuring of haplotypes is more significant in E. brenchleyi than in E. argus. Haplotypes of E. brenchleyi could be divided into four groups by the Yellow River and Taihang Mountains. Within-population genetic diversity indices are correlated neither with latitude nor with longitude. We calculated significant among-population structure for both species (E. argus: Phi(ST) = 0.608, P < 0.001; E. brenchleyi: Phi(ST) = 0.925, P < 0.001). Eremias brenchleyi has four independent management units, while E. argus has a more homogeneous genetic structure across its range. Our data show that: (1) the pattern seen in North American and European species that southern populations have higher genetic diversity as consequence of post-glaciation dispersal is absent in the two Chinese lizards; (2) the Yellow River and Taihang Mountains may have acted as important barriers to gene flow only in E. brenchleyi; and (3) genetic structure differs between the two lizards that differ in habitat preference and dispersal ability.

Amino acid analyses of GSP revealed high levels of glutamic/glutamine, glycine and aspartic/asparagines. SDS-PAGE analysis demonstrated that globulin was the major protein component in GSP, whose subunit molecular weights were mainly varied from 25.5 to 40.0 kDa. The isoelectric pH of GSP was found to be at the acidic pH of around 3.8. At all the pHs tested except pH 2.0, no significant changes of GSP secondary structure were observed. GSP exhibited beneficial functional properties such as preferable solubility and emulsifying activity, while the foaming properties and water holding capacity were relatively poor compared to SPI. It could then be employed to soup, sauce, beverage or meat product for improving nutritional and sensory quality of these foods at appropriate pHs.

To explore the potential function of the PCS1 gene in generating reproductive sterility, we placed the PCS1 gene under the control of an 1,869-bp nucleotide sequence from the 3' end of the second intron (AG-I) of Arabidopsis AGAMOUS and CaMV 35S (-60) minimal promoter [AG-I-35S (-60)::PCS1], and introduced it into tobacco. RT-PCR results demonstrated that the PCS1 gene driven by AG-I-35S (-60) chimeric promoter was expressed only in anthers and carpels in the reproductive tissues of transgenic tobacco. Compared to wild-type plants, all AG-I-35S (-60) and AG-I-35S (-60)::PCS1 transgenic lines showed a normal phenotype throughout the vegetative growth phase. However, during the reproductive stage, most AG-I-35S (-60)::PCS1 transgenic plant anthers displayed delayed dehiscence, failed dehiscence, petalody and hypoplasia, and the pollen grains had different shapes and sizes with a distorted, shrunken, or collapsed morphology. Moreover, three transgenic lines, PCS1-1, PCS1-3 and PCS1-4, showed higher sterility than wild-type and AG-I-35S (-60) transgenic plants, respectively. These results showed that the construct of AG-I-35S (-60)::PCS1 was partially effective at preventing seed set and provided a novel sterility strategy.

For the non-well-poised series F-2(1) (a, b; c; -1), Vidunas has considered its evaluations in the case when c - a + b is an integer. In this paper, we deal first with one-parameter general nonterminating F-2(1)(-1) of evaluations. With Whipple's transformation and Dixon, Watson, Whipple formula, we get the sixteen summation formulas in this type series, among which one formula was essentially known to Vidunas in 2000's and the four formulas were essentially known to Maier in 2006's. Then by means of these nonterminating formulas, the eleven terminating F-2(1)(-1) summation formulas are established by using the limit truncation methods, included two formulas due to EKHAD through computer programs.

Without effective management of the symptomatic SSEH, irreversible severe spinal injury would be possible. We aimed to investigate the diagnosis and surgical management of symptomatic SSEH. Five cases of symptomatic SSEH with favorable neurological recovery after emergent microsurgery were prospectively analysed. The main clinical presentations were root pain and palsy. The main manifestations of MRI were long-segment epidural lesions of high intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images without enhancement. Laminectomy via posterior approach and hematoma removal were undergone for all patients. All patients achieved full neurological recovery without complications. MRI manifestation assisted with the main clinical symptoms may aid the preoperative diagnosis of SSEH, and the delay in obtaining preoperative Digital subtraction angiography is worthwhile, especially for those with progressive neurological deterioration.

In China, the Oujiang color common carp, Cyprinus carpio var. color, is a very important fish, from an economic point of view, and is well used for fish culture in paddy fields. The purpose of this study was to show the low concentrations of cadmium-induced oxidative stress response and DNA damage in the livers of Cyprinus carpio var. color. Superoxide dismutase (SOD), malondialdehyde (MDA), and glutathione (GSH) in liver were measured after exposure to Cd levels (0.41, 0.52, 0.69, 1.03 and 2.06 mg/L, respectively) for 7 days and compared with the control groups. DNA damage, including indicators of damage percentage, DNA tail length (TL) and DNA tail moment (TM) were also analyzed by comet assays. Results showed that MDA and GSH levels in all treatment groups increased significantly relative to the controls (P < 0.01). Treatment with Cd at concentration of 0.41 mg/L increased SOD activity, while treatment with Cd at concentrations > 0.41 mg/L inhibited SOD activities. DNA damage percentage, TL and TM also significantly increased when the Cd level was > 0.41 mg/L. Positive correlations were also found between DNA damage levels and MDA levels (r = 0.74 for DNA damage percentage, r = 0.83 for TL, r = 0.84 for TM; P < 0.01 for all) as well as between GSH and MDA levels (r = 0.77, P < 0.01). These results strongly suggested that Cd-induced DNA damage in the livers of Cyprinus carpio var. color was due to lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress.

The present study investigated the spatiotemporal expression of nuclear factor IL-3 (NFIL3), a transcriptional regulator of the basic leucine zipper transcription factor superfamily, and its potential role in the ovary during the periovulatory period. Immature female rats were injected with pregnant mare's serum gonadotropin, treated with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), and ovaries or granulosa cells were collected at various times after hCG. Nfil3 mRNA was highly induced both in intact ovaries and granulosa cells after hCG treatment. In situ hybridization demonstrated that Nfil3 mRNA was highly induced in theca-interstitial cells at 4-8 h after hCG, localized to granulosa cells at 12 h, and decreased at 24 h. Overexpression of NFIL3 in granulosa cells inhibited the induction of prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase 2 (Ptgs2), progesterone receptor (Pgr), epiregulin (Ereg), and amphiregulin (Areg) and down-regulated levels of prostaglandin E2. The inhibitory effect on Ptgs2 induction was reversed by NFIL3 small interfering RNA treatment. In theca-interstitial cells the expression of hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase 15( nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) (Hpgd) was also inhibited by NFIL3 overexpression. Data from luciferase assays demonstrated that NFIL3 overexpression decreased the induction of the Ptgs2 and Areg promoter activity. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses indicated that NFIL3 binds to the promoter region containing the DNA-binding sites of cAMP response element binding protein and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta. In summary, hCG induction of NFIL3 expression may modulate the process of ovulation and theca-interstitial and granulosa cell differentiation by regulating expression of PTGS2, PGR, AREG, EREG, and HPGD, potentially through interactions with cAMP response element binding protein and CCAAT enhancer binding protein-beta on their target gene promoters.

Using a high-resolution scanning electron microscopy (HRSEM) technique, we acquire distinguishably clear images of the WS2 surface. A large number of small nanorods are found to be evenly distributed among the nanowire arrays, supporting their ordered mesostructures. Based on these observations, tunnel-like connecting pores are proposed to have a similar distribution in the mother mesoporous silica SBA-15 template. Interestingly, we observe the atomic crystal lattices of the layered WS2 on the HRSEM image. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that atomic crystal lattices have been directly observed using a SEM technique. In addition, both materials show good adsorption-desorption capabilities with hydrogen, and the maximum amount of hydrogen that can be taken up is 0.34 wt% for mesoporous WS2 and 0.52 wt% for mesoporous MoS2 at a pressure of 10 bar, indicating that both are potential hydrogen storage materials.

PPL showed excellent catalytic activity and have a good adaptability to different substrates in the reaction. All the reactions go smoothly and provide spirooxindole derivatives with high yield under the mild conditions. This lipase-catalyzed multistep conversion method has provided a new strategy to synthesize spirooxindole derivatives and expanded the application of biocatalysts.

However, conventional technologies used to extract some of these antioxidants may have some limitations. Therefore, there is a need for emerging efficient technologies that are environmentally friendly and that are cost-effective. Supercritical CO2 extraction, which has already reached commercial application for some products, is one of the most widely studied techniques. This technology is simple and fast and allows selective extraction at moderate pressures and low temperatures. This paper reviewed recent findings about the antioxidants including phenolics, terpenoids, carotenoids, sterols, VE and alkaloids. The impact of important parameters related to sample preparation and extraction process on the efficiency of extraction and on the characteristics of the extracted products is evaluated based on an extensive review of recent literatures. The future of extraction of antioxidants is certainly bright with the use of combined other technologies, such as microwave extraction, pulsed electric field, high-pressure processing, ultrasonic extraction, and ohmic heating, that will allow high-quality antioxidants to be produced.

J	Zhao, JA				Zhao, Jian			Effect of Post Production Processing on Dispersion of Carbon Nanofibers in Water	INDUSTRIAL & ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY RESEARCH			English	Article							SMALL-ANGLE SCATTERING; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; NANOTUBES; GRAPHITIZATION; COMPOSITES; EVOLUTION; FIBERS	Dispersion of carbon nanofibers subjected to post production processing, heat treatment (HT) and pyrolytical stripping (PS), is investigated in aqueous suspension using small-angle light scattering. Both samples exhibit a hierarchical morphology consisting of small-scale aggregates and large-scale fractal agglomerates that precipitate rapidly. Although small-scale objects are formed by side-by-side aggregation of the nanofibers in both cases, the determination of the size distribution by assuming a tube model indicates that the PS sample is much less aggregated because of the presence of chemical vapor deposition layer. For HT fibers, the size of large agglomerates remains nearly unchanged during the precipitation process. For PS fibers, large agglomerates precipitate with time, leaving small entities in suspension, which never agglomerate. The HT nanofibers show greater degree of aggregation and agglomeration due to their highly ordered graphite nature. The carbon nanofiber structure significantly influences the dispersion of carbon nanofibers. These findings have significant implications for potential applications of carbon nanofibers in the fields of nanocomposites and biomedical nanostructures.

Environmental cues (e.g., temperature) likely play important roles in these seasonal variations but their exact contributions remain unclear. We conducted a two-factor experiment to elucidate the effects of thermal environments and food availability on growth in body mass, testosterone (T) levels and testes morphology in male Chinese skinks [Plestiodon (Eumeces) chinensis]. Skinks in the thermal environment mimicking spring (April) conditions grew slowly but had higher plasma T levels and larger testes with more viable sperms than those in the thermal environment mimicking summer (July) conditions. Skinks exposed to high food treatment grew faster and had higher plasma T levels and more viable sperms than those exposed to low food treatment. Male growth was negatively correlated with reproductive activity as indicated by T levels and testes size. Therefore, both temperature and food availability are important environmental factors that can affect the reproductive cycle of male lizards, and the mechanisms underlying the trade-off between growth and reproduction could involve the regulation of T levels.

The chirality transfer process shows a broad substrate scope in terms of the aromatic ether substituent, which allows access to a broad of range of chiral 1,1'-binaphthalene-2-alpha-arylmethanol-2'-ols with excellent enantioselectivities (> 99% enantiomeric excess) and yields (84-96%). This should be considered as an available and attractive chiral source to design and prepare privileged ligands or catalysts.

The procedure of MSPD is simple and not time-consuming. C(18)-bonded silica and anhydrous alumina were, respectively, used as dispersion sorbent and purificant, and dichloromethane as extraction reagent. Under the optimum conditions, seven kinds of herbicides were separated completely within 30 min, response was a linear function of concentration over the range 2.5-500 mu g L(-1) with good correlation coefficients (> 0.99) and lower detection limits (0.25 and 0.5 mu g L(-1)). Intra-day and inter-day precision of the peak areas for seven PUHs were less than 3.7 and 5.3%. The new method was used to detect seven PUHs in four kinds of solid foodstuffs with average recoveries range from 73.1 to 101%.

The physical properties are characterized by electrical resistivity, magnetization and Hall resistivity. Tl0.58Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2 undergoes a superconducting transition at T-c(onset) = 32K and T-c(zero) = 31.4K. Extrapolation of the upper critical field H-c2 at T-c to zero temperature gives a large value of H-c2(0) (H-c2(0) = 221T for H parallel to ab and H-c2(0) = 44.2T for H parallel to c). The Hall coefficient changes sign upon cooling down, indicating a possible multi-band behavior. The normal-state magnetic susceptibility decreases with decreasing temperature, suggesting strong antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin fluctuations, which might be related to the superconductivity (SC).

These FTIR spectra obtained from the above-mentioned meningoima tissues were analyzed and compared. Significant differences were found in the spectral features of different kinds of meningoima tissues for example fibrous type meningoima and endothelioid meningoima; and for the same type of meningoima tissues the significant differences in the spectram features can be also observed with the increase of grade malignancy. The malignant tumor can be distinguished primarily from benign tumor by the changes of position, shape and intensity of infrared absorption bands, particularly in the ranges of 1 000 similar to 1 500 cm(-1). The results show that the peak position of the bands (such as 1 160 cm(-1)) can be used to distinguish the characteristic of meningoima which are in agreement with the pathological results. The accuracy is larger than 85%. These results demonstrate that FT-mid-IR spectroscopy exhibits prospect to develop a novel, non-invasive and rapid method for the diagnosis the brain tumors.

Recent breakthroughs in nanotechnology have shown the great advantages of nanoparticles (NPs) in protein encapsulation and controlled release. alpha-Galactosidase and chitosan (CS) were chosen as models for food enzymes and coating materials, respectively. A series of alpha-galactosidase-loaded CS NPs were prepared. The burst release of alpha-galactosidase from NPs and thermal stability of alpha-galactosidase after coating were tested. alpha-Galactosidase-loaded NPs were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS), and zeta potential analysis. The results were as follows: (1) alpha-Galactosidase was successfully encapsulated in CS NPs. (2) alpha-Galactosidase-loaded CS NPs had high encapsulation efficiency. (3) The thermal stability of alpha-galactosidase was significantly increased after loading with CS NPs. (4) The burst release efficiency of CS NPs loaded with alpha-galactosidase was higher than 90% at pH 3.0 and 10.0. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Periodate mediate oxidation was employed to give rise to chitosan with flanking aldehyde groups, onto which oligoamines were conjugated. The polymer structure was confirmed by FT-IR and H-1 NMR spectra. These newly synthesized chitosan derivatives displayed high water-solubility. In vitro cell culture experiments using both normal and tumor cell lines indicated that some polymers synthesized herein possess extremely low cytotoxicity even at concentrations as high as 5.0 mg/mL. Depending on amine type, the IC50 values of newly synthesized chitosan derivatives for both cell lines are 3-4 order of magnitude larger than those of branched polyethyleneimine (25 kDa). Concentration/structure-dependent toxicity was observed for both cell lines as well. In vitro hemolysis test using ethylenediamine-conjugated chitosan suggested that this polymer did not elicit any hemolysis at concentrations up to 200 mu g/mL. In vivo local inflammation evaluation also revealed the compatibility of this polymer post-intramuscular injection. These functionalized chitosan derivatives are candidate materials to construct particulate or hydrogel formulations for biomedical applications. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This raises a question of whether clutch frequency has a key role in influencing the offspring size-number trade-off in lizards. Methodology/Principal Findings: To test the hypothesis that females reproducing more frequently are less likely to tradeoff offspring size against offspring number, we applied the follicle ablation technique to female Eremias argus (Lacertidae) from Handan (HD) and Gonghe (GH), the two populations that differ in clutch frequency. Follicle ablation resulted in enlargement of egg size in GH females, but not in HD females. GH females switched from producing a larger number of smaller eggs in the first clutch to a smaller number of larger eggs in the second clutch; HD females showed a similar pattern of seasonal shifts in egg size, but kept clutch size constant between the first two clutches. Thus, the egg size-number trade-off was evident in GH females, but not in HD females. Conclusions/Significance: As HD females (mean = 3.1 clutches per year) reproduce more frequently than do GH females (mean = 1.6 clutches per year), our data therefore validate the hypothesis tested. Our data also provide an inference that maximization of maternal fitness could be achieved in females by diverting a large enough, rather than a higher-than-usual, fraction of the available energy to individual offspring in a given reproductive episode.

The modified chitosan showed a more ordered structure and a higher hydrophilic character without significantly change of functional group on surface, comparing with the untreated chitosan. By the analysis of the hydrophilic character, zeta potential and XPS of untreated and pretreated chitosan, it can be inferred that the enhancement of interaction between the dye and chitosan was attributed to the increase of free hydroxyl and amine groups on the chitosan surface due to the partial removal of amorphous components induced by H2O2. Thus, the H2O2-induced modification of chitosan should make it easily for amine groups on pretreated chitosan surface to get protonated in weak acidic solution and resulted in simultaneous enhancement of electrostatic interaction between the dye and chitosan molecule. The adsorption results indicated that the dye removal efficiency improved about 60% after the chitosan pretreated with 200 mM hydrogen peroxide for 2 h. In addition, the adsorption of other dyes and the regeneration studies demonstrated that the pretreated chitosan could be recovered and reused effectively for the adsorption of anionic dyes.

Flow cytometry was used to monitor the changes of mitochondrial membrane potential (Delta psi(m)), cell size and apoptosis rate. Treatments of Vero cell cultures with both PCB 126 and PCB 153 resulted in loss of cell viability in our experimental conditions. In ortho-substituted PCB 153 treated cells, loss of cell viability was accompanied by decreased Delta psi(m) and cell shrinkage. The coplanar congener. PCB 126, had no significant effects on Delta psi(m) or cell size in this time period of exposure. These studies showed that PCB 153 is more toxic than coplanar PCB 126 to Vero cells within 24 h exposure. The cytotoxicity mechanism caused by coplanar or non-coplanar PCB congener was different, and apoptosis might be the main cell death pathway in PCB 153 treated cells. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In order to address this issue, the present study examined the life history of a medium-size species, Macrothrix rosea (Cladocera, Macrothricidae), in laboratory conditions. Neonates produced by previously acclimatized parthenogenetic females were cultured at 25 +/- 1 degrees C to investigate their growth rate, fecundity, and development. Our results show that individuals of M. rosea underwent three juvenile instar stages and 10 adult instars at 25 degrees C, with an average lift span 33 +/- 6.33 days. The average total number of eggs produced per individual was 121.04, with a maximum of 151. Individuals in the seventh instar stage (fourth adult instar) produced the largest number of offspring. The growth of body length showed a logarithmic pattern, whereas the cumulative fecundity and population growth appeared to be logistic. Furthermore, we compared the growth and mean fecundity from the birth to the first adult ins-tar at three different temperatures (i.e., 15, 20, and 25 degrees C). The growth rate of body length was slower at lower temperatures than at higher temperatures, while the mean fecundity was higher and the time needed for developing to adult was longer at lower temperatures. In conjunction with previous studies, our data suggest several shared lift history characteristics among cladocerans.

The objective of this study was to on-farm investigate the behavior of nitrate leaching affected by N fertilization rates, rainfall, and temperature in a rainfed winter wheat field in Taihu watershed. The experiment had five urea-N rates (0-360 kg N ha(-1) in 90-kg increments), and nitrate-N in leachate was daily collected by wedge-shaped fiberglass wick lysimeters during four stages (seeding stage, SS; tillering stage. TS; booting stage, BS; harvesting stage, HS). Results showed that: (1) higher potential of leachate would be engendered when the rainfall intensity was over 5.9 mm d(-1); (2) variations of nitrate concentrations in leachate were well responsed to three split fertilizations, which increased with the increase of urea-N applied rates. A similar variation pattern of nitrate concentrations was observed in -0.3 m and -0.6 m soil leachate. Besides, the nitrate concentrations in leachate could be raised with the sharply increase of air temperature, especially in the SS and TS stages; (3) the fluxes of nitrate leaching were significantly affected by N rates (P < 0.05) with the loss ratio varied from 4.0% to 8.5% for five treatments, and the fluxes in four wheat growing stages followed the order of TS > HS > BS > SS. The N application rate of 180 kg N ha(-1) optimized wheat production, but N application over that rate greatly increased nitrate leaching potential. Therefore, options other than lowering the N application rate need to be considered to reduce environmental impacts while maintain winter wheat production. (c) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

IMPEDANCE-MISMATCHED HYPERLENS WITH INCREASING LAYER THICKNESSES	PROGRESS IN ELECTROMAGNETICS RESEARCH-PIER			English	Article							MULTILAYERED STRUCTURES; SUBWAVELENGTH RESOLUTION; OPTICAL HYPERLENS; PERMITTIVITY	Structure with non-negative effective permittivities in the radial and tangential directions can also perform far-field imaging beyond the diffraction limit since the dispersion curves can be long and flat enough and utilized to transfer the subwavelength information. Thus we propose an impedance-mismatched hyperlens with such a dispersion curve and increasing thicknesses (from the innermost layer to the outermost) to reduce reflection losses due to the impedance difference between the nearby layer pairs. Compared with the hyperlens with same thickness for each period, the resolution ability of the hyperlens with varying thicknesses can be improved dramatically, while the image intensity is weaker. Furthermore, the influence of the layer number on the imaging is also analyzed to improve the performance of the system and an improved hyperlens with repeated thickness setting is also utilized to increase the intensity of the magnified image.

The results showed that when the PP-g-MA loading level was 10 wt%, the bending strength, tensile strength, Izod notched impact strength, and elongation at break of PP-wood composites were enhanced by 85% (66.3 MPa), 93% (33.7 MPa), 5.8% (2.01 kJ/m(2)), and 64% (23%), respectively, relative to the uncompatibilized composites. The introduction of pristine CNTs only improved slightly the overall mechanical properties of the compatibilized composites due to poor interfacial compatibility. Unlike CNTs, incorporating hydroxylated CNTs (CNT-OH) could significantly improve all of the mechanical properties; for instance, at 0.5 wt% CNT-OH loading, the flexural strength and tensile strength reached 68.5 MPa, and 40.4 MPa about 6.6% higher than that for the composites with the same CNT loading. Furthermore, CNT-OH also remarkably enhanced the storage modulus. Contact angle and morphology observations indicated that the increases in mechanical properties could be attributed to the improvements of interfacial interactions and adhesions of CNTs with the matrix and fillers.

Thus, reacting 1a, b with 1-arylethanones 2a-2c gave 1-aryl-3-(2-aryl-1,2,3-triazol4- yl)-2-propen-1-ones 3a-3f. The reaction of the latter with thiosemicarbazide afforded 3-aryl-5-(2-aryl-1,2,3-triazol-4-yl)-1-thiocarbamoyl-pyrazolines 4a-4f, which condensed with 2-bromo-1-arylethanones 5a-5c to afford the target compounds 6a-6r.

This is because the differentiation of males is of significant importance for distinguishing closely related species. Simocephalus himalayensis himalayensis Chiang & Chen, 1974 (Cladocera, Simocephalus) is an endemic cladoceran species in the Tibetan plateau, China. To date, no information has been available regarding the morphology and biology of its males. In this study, we provide the morphological and biological data of the males that were produced in laboratory populations. The male individuals are about 1.01-1.20 mm long; the margin of antennulae possess two sensory papilla; dorsal valve margin smooth. Two vas deferens are located between the supra-anal angle and the proximal anal teeth. Sperm is round with a diameter of two micrometers. An updated morphological description and reproductive data of the females of this species are also provided.

Development of a sensitive diagnostic assay to detect Cymbidium mosaic virus and Odontoglossum ringspot virus in members of the Orchidaceae	JOURNAL OF HORTICULTURAL SCIENCE & BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article							COMPLETE NUCLEOTIDE-SEQUENCE; RNA; PCR	The Orchidaceae is a family of flowering plants native to China, members of which possess high ornamental and pharmacological value. Many members of the family Orchidaceae are susceptible to infection by both Odontoglossum ringspot tobamovirus (ORSV) and Cymbidium mosaic potexvirus (CymMV). Symptoms of viral infection include ringspots, mosaics, mottles, chlorotic streaks, and stripes on the leaves, and viral infections cause significant losses in the commercial value of these plants. However, there are no effective measures to control ORSV and CymMV. Therefore, it is vital to identify viral epidemics through the rapid and efficient detection of these two viruses, in order to limit their economic damage. We have developed an assay for detecting co-infection of members of the Orchidaceae by ORSV and CymMV. The coat protein (CP) genes from ORSV and CymMV were cloned and the CPs were expressed in vitro and used to generate two virus-specific polyclonal antisera that were validated by western blotting. Polyclonal anti-ORSV-CP and anti-CymMV-CP antisera were used simultaneously to develop a bi-immunocapture reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (BIC RT-PCR) assay. We demonstrated that the BIC RT-PCR assay was sensitive and specific, and provided a valuable tool for the early detection of ORSV and CymMV in leaf sap extracts from plants of the Orchidaceae.

We prove in this article that a ring R is uniquely clean if and only if R is an exchange ring with all idempotents central, and that for all maximal ideals M of R, R/M congruent to Z(2). It is shown that every uniquely clean ring of which every prime ideal of R is maximal is uniquely nil clean.

J	Xiang, TH; Xu, JM; Wang, L; Lin, L				Xiang Tai-He; Xu Ji-Ming; Wang Lin; Lin Lei			Cloning and Analysis of Two Promoters of Chalcone Synthase Gene A (chsA) in Petunia hybrida	PROGRESS IN BIOCHEMISTRY AND BIOPHYSICS			English	Article						Petunia hybrida; chalcone synthase gene; promoter; cloning	FLAVONOID BIOSYNTHESIS; MULTIGENE FAMILY; EXPRESSION; ANTHERS	Chalcone synthase (CHS), coded by the elm gene super-family, is a key enzyme in flavonoid biosynthesis. Two independent promoters was isolated for chsA, named PchsA-L (550 bp) and PchsA-S (354 bp) (GenBank accession number EF199747 and EF199748 respectively), from the genomic DNA of Petunia hybrida. PchsA-L differs with PchsA-S mainly in that PchsA-L has a 182 bp fragment from 38 similar to 269 bp, and the sequence 103 similar to 201 bp has the characteristics of a typical intron. Both promoter sequences contain conserved sequences of TATA box, CCAAT box, cap site (CCATAA), and the flower-specific promoter sequences TACPyAT box, anther box (TAGAAGTGACAGAAAT), G-box (CACGTG), box 1 element (ATGTCACGTGCCATC) and box2 element (TGTGTTGAAGGTTTGCTA). The petunia plant used for promoter cloning was a diploid with 14 chromosomes. Southern blotting showed that both promoters had multiple copies in the genome. The two promoters segregated in the offspring but the segregation did not meet the ratio of 1 : 2 : 1. qRT-PCR analysis showed no significant difference in chsA gene expression in non-UV-treated and UV-treated floral organ of plants with one or both promoters. The expression of chsA in the UV-treated seedling leaves was increased compared with UV-treated floral organ, and PchsA-L-driven chsA expression in the UV-treated seedling leaves was very significantly increased than that driven by PchsA-S while there was no chsA gene expression in non-UV-treated seedling leaves. The results show the presence of two independent promoters PchsA-L and PchsA-S for chsA in the petunia genome; the 182 bp intron-like sequence in PchsA-L promoter could significantly increased chsA gene expression in UV-treated seedling leaves.

Combining Smart Amplification Process (SMAP) with competition probe, an assay specifically designed to detect point mutation at codon 204 of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) polymerase gene was developed. This assay was sensitive to detect 20 copies of mutant/reaction and recognize as little as 1% of minor mutants in the viral population. The comparison of direct sequencing and SMAP method on 35 clinical specimens showed the concordance in 88% of the cases. This method provides an efficient alternative for rapid identification of HBV mutation associated with lamivudine resistance.

When the output power in the microwave system was set to 30W, after 3 min, 88.4% of the enzyme protein was coupled to the wall of the support pores and the specific activity of the immobilized enzyme was 2.24 U mg(-1), 149.2% higher than that of the free enzyme and 157.0% higher than that of the non-microwave-assisted immobilized enzyme. In catalysis, microwave-assisted immobilized DERA tolerated a wider range of both pH and temperature than other DERA preparations. The thermal and storage stabilities were also significantly improved. This focused: microwave-assisted immobilization technique has proven to be simple, stable and highly efficient. This technique could also be applied to other enzyme immobilizations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Lid. All rights reserved.

Lots of achievements have been made on their synthesis and structural characterization, especially in the last five years. In this critical review, the ordered mesoporous non-oxide materials are categorized by compositions, including non-oxide ceramics, metal chalcogenides, metal nitrides, carbides and fluorides, and systematically summarized on the basis of their synthesis approaches and mechanisms, as well as properties. Two synthesis routes such as hard-templating (nanocasting) and soft-templating (surfactant assembly) routes are demonstrated. The principal issues in the nanocasting synthesis including the template composition and mesostructure, pore surface chemistry, precursor selection, processing and template removal are emphatically described. A great number of successful cases from the soft-templating method are focused on the surfactant liquid-crystal mesophases to synthesize mesostructured metal chalcogenide composites and the inorganic-block-organic copolymer self-assembly to obtain non-oxide ceramics (296 references).

Mean values for selected body temperature (Tsel) and critical thermal maximum (CTMax) were greater in P. versicolor, whereas mean values for critical thermal minimum (CTMin) did not differ between the two species. The two lizards differed in food intake, but not in food passage time, apparent digestive coefficient (ADC) and assimilation efficiency (AE), across the experimental temperatures. Four general conclusions can be drawn from published data. Firstly, thermal preference and thermal tolerance differ among lizards differing in distribution, temporal activity pattern and habitat use. Lizards in thermally more variable regions are better able to tolerate low and high temperatures. Diurnal lizards generally select higher body temperatures than nocturnal lizards, and lizards using habitats with direct sun exposure generally selected higher body temperatures and are better able to tolerate high temperatures. Secondly, CTMax is positively correlated with Tsel. Lizards more likely exposed to extremely high temperatures while active select higher body temperatures than those using shaded habitats. Thirdly, the effects of body temperature on food intake, food passage time, ADC and AE differ among lizards, but it seems to be common among lizards that ADC and AE are less thermally sensitive than food intake and food passage time. Lastly, ADC is dependent on the type of food ingested, with insectivorous lizards digesting food more efficiently than herbivorous lizards [Current Zoology 57 (6): 684- 700, 2011].

In addition, we have demonstrated through a plausible mechanism that the role of silicon in the diarylprolinol silyl ethers (Jorgensen-Hayashi organocatalyst) not only serves as a bulky group to induce steric repulsion but also serves as a Lewis acidic promoter to accelerate the reaction between the secondary amine and the substrate (alpha,beta-unsaturated aldehyde).

Additionally, such advances are argued to be relevant in pathological states, such as disorders of consciousness (DOC), i.e., coma, vegetative and minimally conscious states. Recent studies on resting state activity in DOC, measured with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques, show that functional connectivity is disrupted in the task-negative or the default mode network. However, the two main approaches employed in the analysis of resting state functional connectivity data (i.e., hypothesis-driven seed-voxel and data-driven independent component analysis) present multiple methodological difficulties, especially in non-collaborative DOC patients. Improvements in motion artifact removal and spatial normalization are needed before fMRI resting state data can be used as proper biomarkers in severe brain injury. However, we anticipate that such developments will boost clinical resting state fMRI studies, allowing for easy and fast acquisitions and ultimately improve the diagnosis and prognosis in the absence of DOC patients' active collaboration in data acquisition.

Methods: Immediate psychological consequences were evaluated with the 20-item Self-Report Questionnaire (SRQ-20) and the Impact of Event Scale Revised (IES-R) among 419 undergraduate students (176 being quarantined and 243 being nonquarantined). Results: No significant difference was found between the quarantined group and the nonquarantined group for IES-R screening-positive rate or SRQ-20 screening-positive rate. Multinomial logistic regression analyses indicated that dissatisfaction with control measures was the significant predictor of both SRQ-20 positive screening (OR=2.22) and IES-R positive screening (OR=2.22). Conclusion: These results are consistent with the conclusion that quarantine does not have negative psychological effects under these circumstances. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Herein its genotype and allele frequencies were analyzed using PCR-SSCP in eight pig breeds (N = 416). Two kinds of polymorphisms of the PPAR gamma 2 gene were detected, including a previously reported shift SNP A177G (Met59Val) in exon 1 and a novel silent mutation G876A in exon 5. The results revealed that European pig breeds carry a higher allele A frequency at the A177G locus and a fixed GG genotype at the G876A locus. Allele A at the G876A locus was only found in Jinhua pigs. The association between haplotype (A177G/G876A) and carcass and meat quality traits was analyzed in a Pietrain x Jinhua F2 population (N = 248). The PPAR gamma 2 gene was found to be significantly associated with backfat thickness at the shoulder (p < 0.05), 6-7(th) ribs (p < 0.01), last rib (p < 0.01), gluteus medius (p < 0.05) and ham weight (p < 0.01). Significant effects of different haplotypes on ham weight and backfat thickness at the 6-7(th) ribs, last rib, and gluteus medius were also observed.

In this study we generated CYP2E1 transgenic plants of Petunia using Agrobacterium rhizogenes K599. PCR analysis confirmed that the regenerated plants contained the CYP2E1 transgene and the rolB gene of the Ri plasmid. Southern blotting revealed the presence of multiple copies of CYP2E1 in the genome of transgenic plants. Fluorescent quantitative PCR revealed exogenous CYP2E1 gene expression in CYP2E1 transgenic plants at various levels, whereas no like expression was detected in either GUS transgenic plants or wild-types. The absorption of benzene and toluene by transgenic plants was analyzed through quantitative gas chromatography. Transgenic plants with high CYP2E1 expression showed a significant increase in absorption capacity of environmental benzene and toluene, compared to control GUS transgenic and wild type plants. Furthermore, these plants also presented obvious improved resistance to formaldehyde. This study, besides being the first to reveal that the CYP2E1 gene enhances plant resistance to formaldehyde, also furnishes a new method for reducing pollutants, such as benzene, toluene and formaldehyde, by using transgenic flowering horticultural plants.

Association of TIRAP (MAL) gene polymorhisms with susceptibility to tuberculosis in a Chinese population	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Innate immunity; Single-nucleotide polymorphisms; Toll-interleukin 1 receptor domain containing adaptor protein; Disease susceptibility; Tuberculosis	TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; PULMONARY TUBERCULOSIS; IMMUNE-RESPONSES; POLYMORPHISMS; TLR2; DISEASE; RESISTANCE	Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR) domain containing adaptor protein (TIRAP; also known as MAL) is an essential adaptor molecule in Toll-like receptor signaling, involved in activating the innate immune response during infection. Genetic variations in the TIRAP gene may influence human susceptibility to infectious disease. To date, in the Chinese population, a possible predisposition of TIRAP gene variants to tuberculosis has not been reported. We investigated whether TIRAP gene polymorphisms are associated with the development of tuberculosis in a Chinese population. We investigated all the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the TIRAP exon 5 in a case-control study of 212 patients with tuberculosis and 215 controls in a Chinese population. Genotyping was performed to identify the polymorphisms of TIRAP gene by PCR-DNA sequencing method. Haplotypes for the TIRAP gene variants were constructed using Haploview version 4.2. Six polymorphisms of the SNPs listed in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database were detected in these Chinese tuberculosis patients. It was found that both the frequency of the 286A allele (odds ratio (OR) = 13.37; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75-238.3; P < 0.01) and the frequency of 286AG genotype (OR = 13.57; 95% CI = 0.76-242.5; P < 0.01) were significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls. However, two other SNPs, C539T and C558T, reported to be associated with tuberculosis in other populations, were found not to be associated with tuberculosis in this Chinese population. We conclude that TIRAP G286A (D96N) polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis and may be a new risk factor for the development of tuberculosis in China.	[Zhang, Y.

J	Teng, GD; Zheng, KG; Yu, G				Teng, Guodong; Zheng, Kougen; Yu, Ge			A Mobile-Beacon-Assisted Sensor Network Localization Based on RSS and Connectivity Observations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								Determining the physical positions of sensors has been a fundamental and crucial problem in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the inherent characteristics of WSNs, extremely limited resources available at each low- cost and tiny sensor node, connectivity- based range- free solutions could be a better choice to feature a low overall system cost. However, localization by means of mere connectivity may underutilize the proximity information available from neighborhood sensing. Although received signal strength (RSS) values are irregular and highly dynamic, it might provide heuristic information about which neighboring nodes are closer and which are further. We propose a distributed Mobile- beacon- assisted localization scheme based on RSS and Connectivity observations (MRC) with a specific trajectory in static WSNs. To ensure that MRC performs as true to reality as possible, we propose two improved approaches based on MRC to consider irregular radio scenario in the noisy environment. Comparing the performance with three typical range- free localization methods in static WSNs, our lightweight MRC algorithm with limited computation and storage overhead is more suitable for very low- computing power sensor nodes that can efficiently outperform better with only basic arithmetic operations in the simulation and physical environments.

J	Teng, GD; Zheng, KG; Dong, W				Teng, Guodong; Zheng, Kougen; Dong, Wei			MA-MCL: Mobile-Assisted Monte Carlo Localization for Wireless Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article								As many Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) applications require sensor position information, localization has been an important problem inWSNs. To reduce the number of seeds, a number ofmobile-assisted approaches have been proposed. Current proposed mobile-assisted approaches for localization require special hardware or face route selection problem, however. In this paper, we propose a Mobile-Assisted Monte Carlo Localization (MA-MCL) for WSNs. Our approach relies on direct arriver and leaver information from a single mobile-assisted seed. It does not require any specially designed hardware due to the range-free technique, and the single mobile-assisted seed in our approach can move uncontrollably to avoid route selection problem based on Monte Carlo method. Evaluation results show that the accuracy of MA-MCL outperforms MSL*, MSL, and ADO when all of them use only a mobile seed for localization in the static sensor networks.

Methods: A retrospective study was performed. Patients were followed up for 54 to 114 months (median, 82.8 months). All risk factors that may have affected the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) were assessed. Results: From January 2000 to December 2005, 476 eligible patients were followed up. The 5-year DFS rates of the NACT + RS, RS, and CCRT groups were 85.00%, 77.44%, and 52.94%, respectively (P < 0.0001), whereas the 5-year OS rates were 88.67%, 80.21% and 64.37%, respectively (P < 0.0001). The NACT + RS group had significantly higher survival rates than both the RS (DFS: hazard ratio = 1.870, P = 0.0031; OS: hazard ratio = 1.813, P = 0.0175) and CCRT (DFS: hazard ratio = 3.535, P G 0.0001; OS: hazard ratio = 3.157, P < 0.0001) groups, while adjusting for the pathological type, clinical stage, tumor size (initial), and age. The 5-year DFS rate for patients receiving TP (paclitaxel and cisplatin) was 90.55%, and 71.70% for patients receiving PVB (cisplatin, vincristine, and bleomycin); the 5-year OS rates were 96.75% for TP and 70.09% for PVB, respectively. Patients receiving TP had a statistically significant improvement in both 5-year DFS and OS rates (P < 0.001). Conclusions: Neoadjuvant NACT + RS improves the long-term DFS and OS of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer stage IB2-IIB compared with RS alone and especially compared with CCRT. In the NACT + RS group, NACT with TP improves the long-term DFS and OS of patients compared with patients who had PVB chemotherapy regimen. These results may provide some useful information for clinicians to treat patients with locally advanced cervical carcinoma.

The three methoxyl-substituted isomers were easily differentiated according to the different abundance of the characteristic ion at m/z 136, resulting from the varying reactivity of the (NSC)SCH3 elimination. This fragmentation is triggered by the positive charge upon protonation on the imine N2. Relative to the meta isomer, the positive charge on N2 in the para isomer is dispersed due to the electron donating resonance of the methoxyl group, which leads to higher energy barrier in the dissociation reaction and the less abundant product ion (m/z 136) in the MS/MS. (NSC)SCH3 elimination of the ortho- isomer is further suppressed due to both the resonance effect and the "ortho effect" (an intramolecular hydrogen bond), with much higher energy barrier and extremely lower abundance of the fragment ion (m/z 136, 0.4%). The chloro substituted isomers, however, are short of the above positional effects due to the weak electronic effect of the substituent, and share the similar tandem mass spectrum.

N-butyric acid (n-BA) is one of the key odor compounds selected to represent volatile fatty acids (VFAs) found in piggery facilities. In this study, two biofilters (BFs) packed with compost (BFC) or sludge (BFS) and two biotrickling filters (BTFs) packed with pall rings (BTFP) or multidimensional hollow balls (BTFM), respectively, were compared with regard to their performances in the removal of n-BA. The non-biological removal capacities of packing material of the bioreactors on a per unit volume basis were BFSBFCBTFMBTFP. Maximum biological removal capacities per unit volume of packing material of the bioreactors all exceeded 9.1 kg/m3 center dot d and in the order of BFCBTFMBFSBTFP. Kinetic analysis as well as overall evaluation by radar graphs showed that the BTFs achieved superior removal rates to the BFs in the order of BTFMBTFPBFCBFS. The biotrickling filter packed with multidimensional hollow balls could be an effective technology for VFAs removal. Results from this research provide economical and effective alternatives for odor control in piggery facilities.

Removal efficiency was higher for the syntactic adsorbent when the amount of bamboo charcoal was increased. The optimum dose ratio of bamboo charcoal to chitosan was 6:4, and the optimum amount was 15 mg/L; equilibrium time was 6 hr. The adsorption isotherm was non-linear and could be simulated by the Freundlich model (R-2 = 0.9337). Adsorption efficiency was strongly affected by pH and natural organic matter (NOM). Removal efficiency was 16% higher at pH 3 than at pH 9. Efficiency rate was reduced by 15% with 25 mg/L NOM (UV254 = 0.089 cm(-1)) in drinking water. This study demonstrated that the bamboo charcoal modified with chitosan can effectively remove microcystin-LR from drinking water.

In general, enhanced neutrophil infiltration in tissue is due to cell influx; however, neutrophil apoptosis also plays an important role. We have assessed the effects of TLR4 in the regulation of neutrophil apoptosis in response to administration of LMM hyaluronan. We found that apoptosis of inflammatory neutrophils is impaired in TLR4(-/-) mice, an effect that depends upon the IFN-beta-mediated TRAIL/TRAILR system. IFN-beta levels were decreased in LMM hyaluronan-treated TLR4-deficient neutrophils. The treatment of inflammatory neutrophils with IFN-beta enhanced the levels of TRAIL and TRAILR 2. LMM hyaluronan-induced inflammatory neutrophil apoptosis was substantially prevented by anti-TRAIL neutralizing mAb. We conclude that decreased IFN-beta levels decrease the activity of the TRAIL/TRAILR system in TLR4-deficient neutrophils, leading to impaired apoptosis of neutrophils and resulting in abnormal accumulation of neutrophils in the lungs of LMM hyaluronan-treated mice. Thus, TLR4 plays a novel homeostatic role in noninfectious lung inflammation by accelerating the elimination of inflammatory neutrophils. The Journal of Immunology, 2011, 186: 556-562.

Whereas they are weakly emissive in solution they become strong emitters when aggregated in the condensed phase. In contrast to the general observation that excimer formation quenches the light emission of fluorophores, TPPyE and DPDPyE exhibit efficient excimer emissions in the solid state with high fluorescence quantum yields up to 100%. The pi-pi intermolecular interactions between the pyrene rings, coupled with multiple C-H center dot center dot center dot pi hydrogen bonds, efficiently restrict intramolecular rotations, which block the nonradiative energy decay channel, and hence make the dye molecules highly emissive in the solid state. Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes using TPPyE and DPDPyE as emitters are fabricated, which give green light at low turn-on voltages (down to 3.2 V) with maximum luminance and power, current, and external quantum efficiencies of 49830 cd m(-2), 9.2 lm W-1, 10.2 cd A(-1) and 3.3%, respectively.

BPyBCF, BAnBCF and BTPABCF emit intense blue light with high fluorescence quantum yields (Phi(F) = 75-94%) in solution. However, they exhibit much lower Phi(F) values (30-61%) in the film state, revealing that aggregate formation has quenched their light emission. On the contrary, BTPEBCF is weakly emissive in solution (Phi(F) = 0.3%) but becomes a strong emitter (Phi(F) = 100%) when fabricated into solid film, demonstrating a phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission (AIE). Restriction of intramolecular rotation and suppression of intermolecular interactions due to the propeller-like tetraphenylethene unit are responsible for the AIE phenomenon. All the luminogens are thermally and morphologically stable, showing high glass-transition (T-g = 109-147 degrees C) and thermal-degradation temperatures (T-d = 396-478 degrees C). Non-doped OLEDs using BPyBCF, BAnBCF, and BTPABCF as light-emitting layers are constructed, which give blue electroluminescence with maximum current (eta(C,max)) and external quantum (eta(ext,max)) efficiencies of 4.8 cd A(-1) and 2.3%. With the same device configuration, BTPEBCF shows higher eta(C,max) and eta(ext,max) values of 7.9 cd A(-1) and 2.9%, respectively, thanks to its AIE feature.

Her study also reveals that the lexically encoded person and/or number features of plural pronouns appear to be incompatible with the interpretation they achieve in context. Based on her study, Borthen claims that there is an asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns. In this paper, we first discuss the special use of the third person plural pronoun they in English, the so-called singular they, and then the special use of the third person singular pronoun ta 'he/she/it' in Chinese, providing supportive evidence for Borthen's findings that pronouns are referentially less well-behaved, but counter-evidence against her claim about the asymmetry between plural and singular pronouns.

The present study not only provides an identical and clinically compliant MSC source derived from hESCs (hESC-MSCs), but also describes the immunomodulative effects of hESC-MSCs in vitro and in vivo for a carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)-induced liver inflammation model. Undifferentiated hESCs were treated with Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor and induced to fibroblast-looking cells. These cells were tested for their surface markers and multilineage differentiation capability. Further more, we analyzed their immune characteristics by mixed lymphocyte reactions (MLRs) and animal experiments. hESC-MSCs show a homogenous fibroblastic morphology that resembles bone marrow-derived MSCs (BM-MSCs). The cell markers and differentiation potential of hESC-MSCs are also similar to those of BM-MSCs. Unlike their original cells, hESC-MSCs possess poor immunogenicity and can survive and be engrafted into a xenogenic immunocompetent environment. The hESC-MSCs demonstrate strong inhibitory effects on lymphocyte proliferation in vitro and anti-inflammatory infiltration properties in vivo. This study offers information essential to the applications of hESC-MSC-based therapies and evidence for the therapeutic mechanisms of action.

Transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and N-2 sorption analyses confirmed that the obtained nanostructures have uniform accessible mesopores (similar to 2.2 nm), high surface area (similar to 430 m(2) g(-1)), and large pore volume (similar to 0.22 cm(3) g(-1)). Investigations of drug release and bio-imaging showed that this material has a slow release effect of ibuprofen and good biocompatibility. This work provides an economical approach to fabricate LDH@mSiO(2) core-shell nanostructures, which may have great potential in broad drug delivery and hyperthermia therapy applications.

The magnetism originates from the non-bonding p(z) orbitals of carbon atoms, which cause the flat bands to satisfy the Stoner criterion. On the other hand, boron atoms weaken the magnetic moments of nearby carbon atoms and act as holes doped in the sheets. It induces the down shift of the Fermi level and the half-metallicity in semi-hydrogenated sheets. Our studies demonstrate that the semi-hydrogenation is an effective route to achieve half-metallicity in the boron-carbon systems.

A field experiment	OIKOS			English	Article							PRENATAL STRESS; POPULATION-CYCLES; IMMUNE PARAMETERS; SMALL MAMMALS; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; IMMUNOCOMPETENCE; REPRODUCTION; HYPOTHESIS; PHYSIOLOGY	Maternal stress can have long-term adverse consequences on immunocompetence and disease risk of offspring, and winter survival is a crucial demographic parameter in the life-history of an individual that can substantially affect northern rodent population dynamics. An understanding of the effects of maternal stress on winter survival of offspring may help identify mechanisms driving population fluctuations of northern small mammals. Thus, we assessed the effects of maternal stress, resulting from high population densities, on winter survival of first generation (F-1) and second generation (F-2) in root voles Microtus oeconomus. Replicate high- and low-density enclosed parental populations were established, from which we obtained F-1 generation that were used to establish new enclosed, equal-density populations. The adults of the high-density parental populations had higher corticosterone levels, an indication of physiological stress, than did those of the low-density parental populations. Over-winter survival of the F-1 generation voles from the low-density parental populations was greater than that of those from the high-density parental populations. Over-winter survival of F-2 generation voles did not differ between the two treatments. Our results suggest that maternal stress affected over-winter survival of first generations but not second generations. Reduced immunocompetence, resulting from high population density stresses, transferred to offspring may be a factor in annual (winter) population declines. Because the effect is transitory, i.e. immunocompetence of F-2 voles is not affected, reduced immunocompetence resulting from high density stresses would not contribute to lengthy periods of low population densities that are characteristic of multi-annual population fluctuations.

TD-DFT calculations showed that the delocalization of the sigma-electrons of the silicon destabilized the HOMO energy level of 1, thus red shifting both its absorption and emission spectrum. The addition of F- removed the trimethylsilyl substituents and resulted in a blue shift of both the absorption and fluorescent spectra of 1, which could be monitored by the color change with the naked-eye. Moreover, an easy to prepare test paper, which was obtained by immersing a filter paper into a THF solution of 1, could be utilized to detect and estimate the concentration of fluoride anions in water.

The supercomplex was resolved into a core complex (CPI), LHCII trimers, LHCI dimers and LHCII monomers using green gel electrophoresis. We then investigate changes in the fluorescence and absorption spectra of PSI-LHCI-LHCII under high light. In addition, we compared light-induced denaturation of the core protein subunits in both PSI-LHCI and PSI-LHCI-LHCII. Differences in denaturation and photochemical activity indicated that binding of LHCII increased the photosensitivity of the PSI core. Increased energy delivered to the PSI core during illumination accelerated damage to the core complex.

However, its association with Chinese adult asthmatics has not been studied. Objective: To examine whether vitamin D status is associated with lung function and total serum IgE in Chinese adults with newly diagnosed asthma. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study including 435 Chinese patients aged >18 years with newly diagnosed asthma. Vitamin D status was assessed by measuring serum 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations. The primary outcomes included airflow limitation, as measured by the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), FEV1 % predicted, and FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC), and serum total IgE concentration. Results: Vitamin D deficiency was prevalent in Chinese adults with asthma, with 88.9% of the subjects having 25OHD <50 nmol/l. Serum 25OHD concentration was positively correlated with FEV1 % predicted (p = 0.02, r = 0.12). After adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, smoking, month of blood collection, and symptom duration, we found significant positive associations between 25OHD concentrations and FEV1 (in liters), FEV1 % predicted, and FEV1/FVC (p for trend < 0.05 for all). The adjusted odds ratios for the highest versus the lowest 25OHD quartile were 0.50 (0.26-0.96) for FEV1 <75% predicted and 0.44 (0.20-0.95) for FEV1/FVC% <0.75. There was no significant association between 25OHD concentrations and total IgE. Conclusions: Vitamin D deficiency was highly prevalent in Chinese asthma patients, and vitamin D status was associated with lung function. Copyright (C) 2010 S.

However, the use of this technique has been hindered by the scarcity of family genes with the required level of sequence identity in the genome database. We describe here a strategy for collecting metagenomic homologous genes for DNA shuffling from environmental samples by truncated metagenomic gene-specific PCR (TMGS-PCR). Using identified metagenomic gene-specific primers, twenty-three 921-bp truncated lipase gene fragments, which shared 64-99% identity with each other and formed a distinct subfamily of lipases, were retrieved from 60 metagenomic samples. These lipase genes were shuffled, and selected active clones were characterized. The chimeric clones show extensive functional and genetic diversity, as demonstrated by functional characterization and sequence analysis. Our results indicate that homologous sequences of genes captured by TMGS-PCR can be used as suitable genetic material for DNA family shuffling with broad applications in enzyme engineering.

J	Yang, CP; Zheng, SB; Nori, F				Yang, Chui-Ping; Zheng, Shi-Biao; Nori, Franco			Multiqubit tunable phase gate of one qubit simultaneously controlling n qubits in a cavity	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							PROCESS TOMOGRAPHY; EFFICIENT SCHEME; QUANTUM; ENTANGLEMENT; STATES; ALGORITHMS	We propose how to realize a multiqubit tunable phase gate of one qubit simultaneously controlling n qubits with four-level quantum systems in a cavity or coupled to a resonator. Each of the n two-qubit controlled-phase (CP) gates involved in this multiqubit phase gate has a shared control qubit but a different target qubit. In this proposal, the two lowest levels of each system represent the two logical states of a qubit while the two higher-energy intermediate levels are used for the gate implementation. The method presented here operates essentially by creating a single photon through the control qubit, which then induces a phase shift to the state of each target qubit. The phase shifts on each target qubit can be adjusted by changing the Rabi frequencies of the pulses applied to the target qubit systems. The operation time for the gate implementation is independent of the number of qubits, and neither adjustment of the qubit level spacings nor adjustment of the cavity mode frequency during the gate operation is required by this proposal. It is also noted that this approach can be applied to implement certain types of significant multiqubit phase gates (e. g., the multiqubit phase gate consisting of n two-qubit CP gates which are key elements in quantum Fourier transforms). A possible physical implementation of our approach is presented. Our proposal is quite general and can be applied to physical systems such as various types of superconducting devices coupled to a resonator and trapped atoms in a cavity.

In this Michael reaction of 4-hydrocoumarin, the cooperative catalyst system (LiClO4/DPEN) resulted in higher levels of stereoselectivity (up to 94%ee). Additionally, the mechanism of the enantioselectivity enhancement in the cooperative catalytic Michael reaction has been investigated by using of ESI-MS and the study of nonlinear effect.

The electronic effect of the substituent on the phenyl group at para-position also affects the reaction by varying the calculated energy barrier.

Recent advances in non-invasive measurement of embryonic heart rates allow us to answer a long-standing puzzle in reptilian developmental biology: Do the metabolic and developmental rates of embryos acclimate to local incubation regimes, as occurs for metabolic acclimation by post-hatching reptiles? Based on a strong correlation between embryonic heart rate and oxygen consumption, we used heart rates as a measure of metabolic rate. We demonstrate acclimation of heart rates relative to temperature in embryos of one turtle, one snake and one lizard species that oviposit in relatively deep nests, but found no acclimation in another lizard species that uses shallow (and hence, highly thermally variable) nests. Embryonic thermal acclimation thus is widespread, but not ubiquitous, within reptiles.

We find that the spatial decoherence of the two atoms depends strongly on their relative position. Taking into account the spatial degrees of freedom, we investigate the entanglement dynamics of the internal states of the two atoms. It is shown that the entanglement decays to almost zero in a finite time, and the disentanglement time depends on the width of the wave packets describing the atomic spatial distribution.

We found that it is unique from the profiles of human parvovirus B19 and simian parvovirus, the members in the genus Erythrovirus so far characterized, in that the small RNA transcripts were not processed for encoding small non-structural proteins. However, like the large non-structural protein NS1 of the human parvovirus B19, the ChpPV NS1 is a potent inducer of apoptosis. Further phylogenetic analysis of ChpPV with other parvoviruses in the subfamily Parvovirinae indicates that ChpPV is distinct from the members in genus Erythrovirus. Thus, we conclude that ChpPV may represent a new genus in the family Parvoviridae.

The gene responsible for the mutation was previously determined to be phospholipase C, delta 1 (Plcd1; mutant allele symbol Plcd1(snthr1Bao)). To map the modifiers of Plcd1, an intercross (DBA/2J-snthr(1Bao)/snthr(1Bao) x C57BL/6J+/+) was conducted. The F2 mutant progeny exhibited a variety of alopecia phenotypes; all F2 mutants (n=507) were classified into 3 groups (mild, moderate, and severe alopecia) and genotyped based on 96 microsatellites. A major QTL was identified on mouse chromosome (mChr) 15 at 12 cM with an LOD score greater than 7 (P < 0.0001). Three minor QTLs were detected on mChr 2, 5, and 7 at 40, 84 and 48 cM, respectively. The QTLs on mChr 7 and 15 were associated with minor alopecia while the QTLs on mChr 2 and 5 were associated with moderate to severe alopecia. No antagonistic or synergistic effects among or between the 4 QTLs were found. Integrating the functions of the 4 potential regulatory QTLs and mutant Plcd1(snthr1Bao), we found that these QTLs might contribute to variations of scant hair severity by altering the Ca2+ signal pathways in mouse skin.

The samples were characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and fluorescence spectroscopy (FS). The incorporating of Eu3+ ions into NaYF4 crystal lattice influenced the symmetry types of NaYF4 crystals, resulting in phase transformation of NaYF4 crystals between and phase. The pure hexagonal phase of branched NaYF4:Eu3+ was obtained as the Eu3+ concentration reached 15 mol.%.

The PLGA sponge lost its weight steadily in vitro, but degraded much faster in the construct of PLGA/fibrin gel/BMSCs implanted in the full-thickness cartilage defects. The in vivo degradation of the fibrin gel inside the construct was prolonged to 12 wk too. The CM-DiI labeled allogenic BMSCs were detectable after transplantation (implantation) into the defects for 12 wk by small animal in vivo fluorescence imaging and confocal laser scanning microscopy. In vivo repair experiments were firstly performed by implantation of the PLGA/fibrin gel/BMSCs and PLGA/BMSCs constructs into full-thickness cartilage defects (3 mm in diameter and 4 mm in depth) of New Zealand white rabbits for 12 wk. The defects implanted with the PLGA/fibrin gel/BMSCs constructs were filled with cartilage-like tissue containing collagen type II and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), while those by the PLGA/BMSCs constructs were filled with fibrous-like tissues. To repair the defects of larger size (4 mm in diameter), addition of growth factors was mandatory as exemplified here by further loading of TGF-beta 1. Implantation of the PLGA/fibrin gel/BMSCs/TGF-beta 1 constructs into the full-thickness cartilage defects for 12 wk resulted in full restoration of the osteochondral tissue. The neo-cartilage integrated well with its surrounding cartilage and subchondral bone. Immunohistochemical and GAGs staining confirmed the similar distribution of collagen type II and GAGs in the regenerated cartilage as that of hyaline cartilage. The quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed that the cartilage special genes were significantly up-regulated compared with those of the TGF-beta 1 absent constructs.

The objective of this paper was to characterize the T (shao) , a specific T-box mutation, in mice. T (shao) , a short-tailed mutant mouse strain in a B6 background, was obtained by ethylnitrosourea mutagenesis. Microsatellite genomic scans mapped the location of the mutation. RT-PCR was used to amplify the identified region and the product was sequenced. DNA of the region was sequenced and scanned for mutations. Tails of T (shao) mice were mostly curly with tail length ranging from less than 1 cm (tail bud) to half of the normal length. T (shao) presented single dominance gene inheritance, and homozygous mutant mice died approximately at E10. Scans of the F2 generation mapped the mutant gene to chromosome 17, near D17Mit143. The Brachyury (T) gene was identified as a potential candidate gene in this location. To confirm this, RT-PCR was performed on RNA from intercrossed 8.5-day embryos, and products were sequenced. A 67-nucleotide deletion in exon 2 of the mutant T gene was identified. Further sequencing of the genomic DNA from this region identified a T to A transversion at the 67th nucleotide of exon 2. The T (shao) mutation is a result of a deletion in exon 2 causing the early termination and loss of function of protein encoded by the T gene, manifesting as a short tail phenotype.

This has hampered studies into the ecology and natural history of turtles in their natural habitats because many species have become so rare that they are simply unavailable for study. One way to re-establish or supplement these turtle populations is through translocation (either of wild-caught individuals or those raised in farms). However, successful translocation is partly dependent upon released individuals maintaining site fidelity. We translocated 16 big-headed turtles, Platysternon megacephalum, in southern China to study their movements and microhabitat use in the wild and use this information to evaluate the feasibility of translocation as a conservation technique for this species. Translocated turtles generally moved short distances (daily range: 0-89.6 m), with males moving further than females and both sexes moving further at night than during the day. Additionally, big-headed turtles rarely used terrestrial habitats (the maximum distance an individual was located from the stream was 5.8 m) and remained hidden in refugia most of the time. Some sex differences in microhabitat use were also apparent; females were visible less often, spent more time on land (which coincided with the nesting season), remained closer to the stream bank, used shallower water, and used different types of refugia than males. The very short distances that bigheaded turtles moved, combined with their consistent fidelity to the stream and cryptic behavior, all suggest that this species would be a good candidate for larger-scale translocation experiments. To our knowledge, this is the first published study of movement patterns and habitat use of translocated semiaquatic or aquatic turtles outside of Europe and the first published radiotelemetry study of turtles from mainland China.

Heterozygotes had morphological characteristics including albinism of the abdomen, extremities, and tail, whereas the homozygotes had albinism of the body, black eyes, and infertility. The homozygous mutants showed small, structurally abnormal gonads, and lacked germ cells. Heterozygous male mice lacked germ cells in some contorted seminiferous tubules. This mutation has been mapped at 43.8 cM from the centromere in chromosome 5 by linkage analysis and Kit has been identified as the candidate gene. After Kit full-length mRNA amplification, it was found that a G to T conversion at position 1228 in the ORF changed the 410th amino acid from V to F. This amino acid change could affect the protein's secondary structure. Heterozygous mutant mice were intercrossed and homozygous mutant mice were bred and genotyped. We found that no primordial germ cells (PGCs) appeared in the urogenital ridge area at fetus day 11.5 in the homozygotes. The number of PGCs also significantly decreased in heterozygotes. At fetus day 15.5, the differentiation of the testis tubule structure was unclear; as well, they contained no spermatogonia. Female homozygotes contained no primordial follicles in the ovary. The numbers of PGCs and primordial follicles were significantly decreased in heterozygous mice. W(-2Bao) is the only mutated site in the extracellular 4th Ig-like domain and this mutant mouse model provides new material for the study of the mechanism of reproductive system development.

Matching NLO parton shower matrix element with exact phase space: case of W -> l nu(gamma) and gamma (au)->pi (+) pi (-)(gamma)	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							QED RADIATIVE-CORRECTIONS; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; QUARK PAIR PRODUCTION; PHOTOS; BREMSSTRAHLUNG; SCATTERING; E(+)E(-); SINGULARITIES; PREDICTIONS; EMISSION	Monte Carlo is often used for simulation of QED effects in decay of intermediate particles and resonances. Momenta are generated in such a way that samples of events cover the whole bremsstrahlung phase space. With the help of selection cuts, experimental acceptance can then be taken into account. The program is based on an exact multi-photon phase space. A crude matrix element is obtained by iteration of a universal multidimensional kernel. It ensures exact distribution in the soft photon region. The algorithm is compatible with exclusive exponentiation. To evaluate the program's precision, it is necessary to control the kernel with the help of perturbative results. If available, the kernel is constructed from the exact first order matrix element. This ensures that all terms necessary for non-leading logarithms are taken into account. In the present paper we will focus on the W -> l nu and gamma (au)->pi (+) pi (-) decays. The Born level cross sections for both processes approach zero in some points of the phase space. A process dependent compensating weight is constructed to incorporate the exact matrix element, but is recommended for use in tests only. In the hard photon region, where scalar QED is not expected to be reliable, the compensating weight for gamma (au) decay can be large. With respect to the total rate, the effect remains at the permille level. It is nonetheless of interest. The terms leading to the effect are analogous to some terms appearing in QCD. The present paper can be understood either as a contribution to discussion on how to match two collinear emission chains resulting from charged sources in a way compatible with the exact and complete phase space, exclusive exponentiation and the first order matrix element of QED (scalar QED), or as the practical study of predictions for accelerator experiments.

Allusion, as a refined and unique rhetoric of language, is one of the important artifices of parody in the poem, the skillful employment of which not only adds color to the language and enhances the satire, but also deepens the poem' s theme and widens the readers' imaginative spaces, resulting in some association of ideas in relation to the moral problems.

Experiment design: We first conducted two fMRI experiments in healthy subjects to identify brain regions specifically associated with self-perception through the use of different auditory stimuli that had different grades of self-relatedness. We then applied these regions as functional localizers to examine the relationship between neural activity changes during self-relatedness and consciousness level in the patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC). Principal observations: We demonstrated recruitment of various anterior medial cortical regions including the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) in healthy subjects during auditory perception of self-related stimuli. We further showed that patients with DOC showed signal changes in the ACC during auditory perception of self-related stimuli. Finally, it was shown that these signal changes correlate with the level of consciousness in the patients with DOC. Conclusion: The degree of consciousness in patients with DOC was correlated with neural activity in the ACC induced by self-related stimuli. Our results not only shed light on the pathophysiology of DOC, but may also suggest a useful neural, and thus diagnostic, marker of the dysfunction of consciousness in vegetative patients.

We performed MTS assays to determine the non-cytotoxic concentration of honokiol for HRMCs. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays were performed to analyze the expressions of the proteins interleukin (IL)-1 beta, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta 1, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1 alpha, RANTES, and prostaglandin (PG) E2. The total nitric oxide (NO) concentration was determined using the Griess reaction. Treatment with 50 mmol/L glucose markedly increased the level of IL-1 beta, IL-18, TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO, TGF-beta 1, MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and RANTES. Honokiol (similar to 20 mu mol/L) treatment inhibited the HG-induced expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 beta, IL-18, TNF-alpha, PGE2, NO, and TGF-beta 1 in a dose-dependent manner. Moreover, it markedly inhibited the expression of chemokines such as MCP-1, MIP-1 alpha, and RANTES, which are upregulated under HG conditions. Honokiol inhibits the HG-induced expression of inflammatory factors in HRMCs. Honokiol may be considered a promising drug with potent anti-inflammatory activities in addition to its strong anti-cancer, anti-angiogenesis, and anti-neurodegenerative effects.

Its Eu(III) complex with 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone (HTTA) was prepared and characterized by elemental analysis, IR and H-1 NMR spectra. The photophysical properties of the complex were studied in detail by using UV, luminescence spectra, luminescence lifetime and quantum yield. The complex exhibited nearly monochromatic red emission at 612 nm, a remarkable luminescence quantum yield at room temperature (36.0%) upon ligand excitation and a long D-5(0) lifetime (458 mu s), which indicated that the ligand phenNO(2) could sensitize the luminescence of Eu(III) ion efficiently.

Finally, the protonated amine groups in the resultant organic-inorganic hybrid mesoporous silicas were neutralized by treating with potassium bicarbonate, leading to the immobilized basic amino-containing task-specific ionic liquids (TSILs). Using Knoevenagel condensation as test reaction, the immobilized basic TSILs showed higher efficiency (particularly reusability) than that of similar pure basic TSIL of N-(3-aminopropyl), N(3)-(methyl)-imidazolium tetrafluoroborate or amino-functionalized mesoporous silicas in aqueous media. Much higher catalytic performance of the immobilized basic TSILs, as compared with the pure basic TSIL, could be due to the depressed reaction between amine groups and the hydrogen at C2 of imidazolium derivative cations in the immobilized basic TSILs and to the acid-base cooperativity between the silanols on the pore surface of the siliceous supports and amine groups. On the other hand, that amine groups nucleophilically attack the Si-O-Si bonds on the pore surface was suppressed due to steric hindrance resulted from the existence of dihydroimidazolium cations in the organic structure of the immobilized basic TSILs, leading to low leaching level of the active species in the immobilized TSILs during the reuse process. As such, the immobilized basic TSILs showed much better reusability in comparison with the amino-functionalized mesoporous silicas. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The majority of these cells are produced in mitotic regions called meristems. For primary or tip growth of the roots and shoots, the meristems are located in the apices. These apical meristems have been shown to function as developmentally regulated and environmentally responsive stem cell niches. The principle requirements to maintain a functioning meristem in a dynamic system are a balance of cell division and differentiation and the regulation of the planes of cell division and expansion. Woody plants also have secondary indeterminate mitotic regions towards the exterior of roots, stems and branches that produce the cells for continued growth in girth. The chief secondary meristem is the vascular cambium (VC). As its name implies, cells produced in the VC contribute to the growth in girth via the production of secondary vascular elements. Although we know a considerable amount about the cellular and molecular basis of the apical meristems, our knowledge of the cellular basis and molecular functioning of the VC has been rudimentary. This is now changing as a growing body of research shows that the primary and secondary meristems share some common fundamental regulatory mechanisms. In this review, we outline recent research that is leading to a better understanding of the molecular forces that shape the cellular structure and function of the VC.

J	Yang, CP				Yang, Chui-Ping			Quantum information transfer with superconducting flux qubits coupled to a resonator	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article								We propose a way for implementing quantum information transfer with two superconducting flux qubits by coupling them to a resonator. This proposal does not require adjustment of the level spacings or uniformity in the device parameters. Moreover, neither adiabatic passage nor a second-order detuning is needed by this proposal, thus the operation can be performed much faster when compared with the previous proposals.

The ligand-receptor complex 20E-EcR/USP directly activates a small set of early-response genes and a much larger set of late-response genes. However, ecdysone-responsive genes have not been previously characterized in the context of insect chitin biosynthesis. Principal Findings: Here, we show that injection-based RNA interference (RNAi) directed towards a common region of the two isoforms of SeEcR in a lepidopteron insect Spodoptera exigua was effective, with phenotypes including a high mortality prior to pupation and developmental defects. After gene specific RNAi, chitin contents in the cuticle of an abnormal larva significantly decreased. The expression levels of five genes in the chitin biosynthesis pathway, SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP, SeCHSA and SeCHSB, were significantly reduced, while there was no difference in the expression of SeTre-2 prior to 72 hr after injection of EcR dsRNA. Meanwhile, injection of 20E in vivo induced the expression of the five genes mentioned above. Moreover, the SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB genes showed late responses to the hormone and the induction of SeTre1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB genes by 20E were able to be inhibited by the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide in vitro indicating these genes are 20E late-response genes. Conclusions: We conclude that SeTre-1, SeG6PI, SeUAP and SeCHSB in the chitin biosynthesis pathway are 20E late-response genes and 20E and its specific receptors plays a key role in the regulation of chitin biosynthesis via inducing their expression.

The structural characterizations were performed by means of X-ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. It is demonstrated that oBN is a direct band gap semiconductor (E-g similar to 3.43 eV). Excited by ultraviolet laser (wavelength at 325 nm), the oBN films emit strong white light, which can be seen by the naked eyes in the dark. In the photoluminescence spectrum, besides the ultraviolet near-band-edge radiative recombination emission, there are three visible emission bands (centered at 400, 538, and 700 nm) arising from the defect-related deep-level centers of oBN, which are mixed to form the white light emission. The hardness and elastic modulus of oBN films are 11.5 and 94 GPa, respectively, examined by nanoindentation measurements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Sun, Z; Lu, XM; Song, LJ				Sun, Zhe; Lu, Xiao-Ming; Song, Lijun			Quantum discord induced by a spin chain with quantum phase transition	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article								We study quantum discord induced by a quantum-critical environment. Two spin halves are independently coupled to the common environment which is modelled by the Ising spin chain in a transverse field. During the time evolution, non-zero discord is induced whereas entanglement cannot be induced due to the special initial state chosen by us. For some cases we analytically obtain quantum discord and its geometric measure. From the numerical results, one can observe that induced quantum discord increases quickly from zero to a steady value when the environment approaches the critical point. Moreover, induced discord may reach its maximum close to the critical point. The special phenomena of induced discord can be used to indicate quantum criticality. We also consider another environment modelled by the spin-1/2 XX chain with three-spin interaction, which also displays second-order quantum phase transition.

In this work, the effect of a feeding strategy on the production of a thermophilic DERA was investigated in fed-batch cultures of recombinant Escherichia coli BL21 (pET303-DERA008). The predetermined specific growth rate (A mu (set)) was evaluated at 0.20, 0.15, and 0.10 h(-1), respectively. The DERA concentration and volumetric productivity were associated with A mu (set). The cells synthesized the enzyme most efficiently at A mu (set) = 0.15 h(-1). The maximum enzyme concentration (5.12 g/L) and total volumetric productivity (0.256 g L(-1) h(-1)) obtained were over 10 and five times higher than that from traditional batch cultures. Furthermore, the acetate concentration remained at a relatively low level, less than 0.4 g/L, under this condition which would not inhibit cell growth and target protein expression. Thus, a specific growth rate control strategy has been successfully applied to induce fed-batch cultures for the maximal production of the thermophilic 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate aldolase.

PLANTS; CONSTRUCTED WETLANDS; NITROGEN FORM; AMMONIUM NUTRITION; SUPPLIED NITROGEN; NITRATE; MACROPHYTES; ALLOCATION; SEEDLINGS	Sweet flag (Acorus calamus L) and yellow flag (Iris pseudacorus L) have been used increasingly in constructed wetlands (CWs) for treatment of eutrophic wastewater. In order to properly match plant species with the type of wastewater being treated, it is important to know the performance of plant species under different NO3-/NH4+ ratios. We investigated dry matter (DW) production and N content of A. calamus and I. pseudacorus under five NO3-/NH4+. ratios (100/0, 75/25, 50/50. 25/75, and 0/100) in a hydroponic system. Results showed that the two species exhibited different preferences for NO3- and NH4+. Total DW, shoot DW, and N content were greater with NO3-/NH4+ ratios of 50/50 and 75/25 than otherwise for A. calamus, but these parameters were only higher under the sole NO3- treatment in I. pseudacorus. We conclude that A. calamus could be best used for treating wastewater in constructed wetlands with NO3-/NH4+ ratios between 50/50 and 75/25, while I. pseudacorus for treating wastewater with NO3- only to achieve the highest biomass production and efficiency in the removal of N.

J	Du, WG; Shine, R				Du, Wei-Guo; Shine, Richard			Why do the eggs of lizards (Bassiana duperreyi: Scincidae) hatch sooner if incubated at fluctuating rather than constant temperatures?	BIOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						developmental plasticity; egg incubation; embryonic metabolism; heart rate; reptile	PHENOTYPIC VARIATION; HEART-RATE; EMBRYOS; EVOLUTION; TURTLE; VIVIPARITY; ENERGETICS; DURATION; REPTILES; GROWTH	Reptilian eggs hatch sooner if incubated at higher temperatures, but why should increased diel thermal fluctuation (independent of mean temperature) also modify the duration of incubation? In the montane scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi, eggs incubated at 22 +/- 7 degrees C hatched > 10% sooner than did sibling eggs kept at a constant 22 degrees C (55 versus 62 days). We non-invasively measured embryonic heart rates, which are highly correlated with rates of embryonic oxygen consumption, as well as with rates of embryogenesis, to test three explanations (exponential relationships between temperature and developmental rate; thermal acclimation of developmental rate; and facultative shifts in the degree of embryogenesis completed before hatching) aiming to explain why fluctuating-temperature incubation reduces the incubation period. Heart rates did not acclimate to incubation temperature regimes. Hatchling body sizes did not differ among the two treatments. We found an exponential relationship between temperature and heart rate, which means that embryonic cardiac output was increased more by a diel increase in temperature than it was decreased by a diel fall in temperature, leading to 7% more daily heartbeats at 22 +/- 7 degrees C than at 22 degrees C. This nonlinear thermal sensitivity of developmental rate is the reason why diel thermal fluctuations accelerate embryogenesis, and thus hasten hatching, in B. duperreyi. The generality of this relationship implies that, in cool-climate squamate reptiles, mothers might be able to hasten the hatching dates (and thus viability) of their offspring by selecting nest sites that provide high diel thermal variation as well as high mean temperatures.

Ignoring this fatigue can contribute to worsening overall health of patients and a slowed recovery process. Objective: We investigated the effectiveness of a warm-water footbath on relieving fatigue and insomnia problems in patients undergoing chemotherapy. Methods: This was a 2-group, longitudinal study design. Adults diagnosed with gynecologic cancer and receiving a 4-series platinum chemotherapy regimen were recruited and then followed up for 6 months. They completed fatigue and insomnia items on the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 7th, and 14th days after each scheduled chemotherapy. Participants in the experimental group soaked their feet in 41 degrees C to 42 degrees C warm water for 20 minutes every evening, starting from the eve of receiving the first chemotherapy, whereas participants in the comparison group did not do so. Results: There were 25 and 18 participants in the comparison and experimental groups, respectively, who completed the study. Participants in the experimental group reported a significant reduction in fatigue and improvement in sleep quality from the second session of chemotherapy and continued to improve during the study period. Conclusions: A warm-water footbath intervention resulted in reduced fatigue and insomnia symptoms for gynecologic cancer patients during chemotherapy. Implications for Practice: A warm-water footbath is local moist heat application. It is noninvasive and easy to apply at home. The findings provide empirical support that a warm-water footbath relieves fatigue and insomnia problems of patients undergoing chemotherapy. It can be a nonpharmaceutical method to help patients overcome fatigue and sleep problems during chemotherapy.

Based on the generalized diffraction integrals, a general propagating formula of anomalous hollow beam is derived. Based on the derived formula, the propagation properties of anomalous hollow beam through the misaligned optical system are numerically illustrated. From the numerical results we can get that when an anomalous hollow beam propagates through a misaligned optical system, the shape of the output beam changes as the propagation distance increases, and the center of the output beam is deviated from the optical axis. The position of the output beam is effected by the misaligned parameters, and can be controlled by adjusting them. This method provides a convenient tool for studying the propagation and transformation of an anomalous hollow beam through the misaligned optical system.

We show that the GMQD of a two-qubit state can be alternatively obtained through the singular values of a 3 x 4 matrix whose elements are the expectation values of Pauli matrices of the two qubits. By using Heisenberg picture, the analytic results of the GMQD is obtained for three typical kinds of the quantum decoherence channels. We compare the dynamics of the GMQD with that of the quantum discord and of entanglement. We show that a sudden change in the decay rate of the GMQD does not always imply that of the quantum discord, and vice versa. We also give a general analysis on the sudden change in behavior and find that at least for the Bell diagonal states, the sudden changes in decay rates of the GMQD and that of the quantum discord occur simultaneously.

In the last decades, significant achievements have been made in the field of catalytic enantioselective reactions involving the use of alpha-amido sulfones as in situ equivalents of activated imines. These, in combination with diverse nucleophiles, are used to prepare optically pure amines or N-protected amides. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthetic applications of alpha-amido sulfones as reactive precursors of imines in the asymmetric addition of organometallic reagents, Mannich, aza-Henry, Strecker, and other asymmetric nucleophilic addition reactions.

Synthesis and Application of the Cationic Lignin Amine Flocculant	TENSIDE SURFACTANTS DETERGENTS			English	Article						Kraft lignin; cationic flocculants; reactive brilliant blue KN-R; linear alkylbenzene sulphonate		Cationic lignin amine flocculants were obtained by the Mannich reaction of Kraft lignin with formaldehyde and polyamines. The cationic reaction products were tested as a flocculating agent by flocculation of reactive brilliant blue KN-R and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates in an aqueous system. The effects of flocculant dosage and pH on the flocculation performance are discussed in detail. The results indicate that under optimum conditions, the rate of eliminating reactive brilliant blue KN-R and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates from the water exceed 99% and 96% respectively, which illustrated that the cationic reaction products are extremely effective as flocculants for reactive brilliant blue KN-R and linear alkylbenzene sulphonates.

The aim of this study is to investigate the plasma levels of interleukin-18 (IL-18), macrophage-inflammatory protein-1 alpha (MIP-1 alpha), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1), stromal cell derived factor-1 (SDF-1), and regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) in patients with MDD before and after eight week treatment of fluoxetine hydrochloride in comparison with normal controls. All subjects were assessed before and after treatment with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). Our results showed that the symptoms of forty healthy controls and thirty-four patients with MDD were correlated with their plasma levels of IL-18, MIP-1 alpha, MCP-1, SDF-1 alpha, and RANTES. The levels of all five cytokine of patients with MDD were significantly decreased after treatment. However, the levels remained significantly higher than those of the healthy controls (p<0.001). In the seven depressed subjects whose HDRS score fell to below seven after antidepressant therapy comparing with those subjects whose HDRS score larger than seven, the mean levels of IL-18 (p=0.01) and SDF-1 alpha(p<0.05) were significantly lower. Conversely, higher levels of cytokines correlated with a persistently increased severity of symptoms, as measured by the HDRS scores. In conclusion, these findings suggest that MDD is associated with activation of the immune system, and the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine may be mediated in part through its anti-inflammatory effects.

Elucidation of a Novel Extracellular Calcium-binding Site on Metabotropic Glutamate Receptor 1 alpha (mGluR1 alpha) That Controls Receptor Activation	JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article							CA2+-BINDING SITES; CA2+-SENSING RECEPTORS; SENSING RECEPTOR; STRUCTURAL BASIS; PROTEINS; CA2+; AFFINITY; DOMAIN; CELLS; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR-1-ALPHA	Metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 alpha (mGluR1 alpha) exerts important effects on numerous neurological processes. Although mGluR1 alpha is known to respond to extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](o)) and the crystal structures of the extracellular domains (ECDs) of several mGluRs have been determined, the calcium-binding site(s) and structural determinants of Ca2+-modulated signaling in the Glu receptor family remain elusive. Here, we identify a novel Ca2+-binding site in the mGluR1 alpha ECD using a recently developed computational algorithm. This predicted site (comprising Asp-318, Glu-325, and Asp-322 and the carboxylate side chain of the receptor agonist, Glu) is situated in the hinge region in the ECD of mGluR1 alpha adjacent to the reported Glu-binding site, with Asp-318 involved in both Glu and calcium binding. Mutagenesis studies indicated that binding of Glu and Ca2+ to their distinct but partially overlapping binding sites synergistically modulated mGluR1 alpha activation of intracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+](i)) signaling. Mutating the Glu-binding site completely abolished Glu signaling while leaving its Ca2+-sensing capability largely intact. Mutating the predicted Ca2+-binding residues abolished or significantly reduced the sensitivity of mGluR1 alpha not only to [Ca2+](o) and [Gd3+](o) but also, in some cases, to Glu. The dual activation of mGluR1 alpha by [Ca2+](o) and Glu has important implications for the activation of other mGluR subtypes and related receptors. It also opens up new avenues for developing allosteric modulators of mGluR function that target specific human diseases.

J	Zheng, SB; Yang, CP; Nori, F				Zheng, Shi-Biao; Yang, Chui-Ping; Nori, Franco			Arbitrary control of coherent dynamics for distant qubits in a quantum network	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							ENTANGLEMENT	We show that the coherent coupling of atomic qubits at distant nodes of a quantum network, composed of several cavities linked by optical fibers, can be arbitrarily controlled via the selective pairing of Raman transitions. The adiabatic elimination of the atomic excited states and photonic states leads to selective qubit-qubit interactions, which would have important applications in quantum-information processing. Quantum gates between any pair of distant qubits and parallel two-qubit operations on selected qubit pairs can be implemented through suitable choices of the parameters of the external fields. Selective pairing of Raman transitions also allows the generation of spin chains and cluster states without the requirement that the cavity-fiber coupling be smaller than the detunings of the Raman transitions.

Identifying genetic markers is a useful step toward understanding the genetic basis of high myopia, particularly in the Chinese population, where it is highly prevalent. This study was conducted to provide evidence of linkage for autosomal dominant high myopia to a locus on chromosome 5p13.3-p15.1 in a large Chinese family. Methods: After clinical evaluation, genomic DNA from 29 members of this family was genotyped. A genome-wide screen was then performed using 382 markers with an average inter-marker distance of 10cM, and two-point linkage was analyzed using the MLINK program. Mutation analysis of the candidate genes was performed using direct sequencing. Results: Linkage to the known autosomal dominant high myopia loci was excluded. The genome-wide screening identified a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.71 theta=0.00 with the microsatellite marker D5S502. Fine mapping and haplotype analysis defined a critical region of 11.69 cM between D5S2096 and D5S1986 on chromosome 5p13.3-p15.1. Sequence analysis of the candidate genes inside the linked region did not identify any causative mutations. Conclusions: A genetic locus was mapped to chromosome 5p13.3-p15.1 in a large Chinese family with autosomal dominant high myopia.

The input parameters required for the correlation are temperature, the solute molar mass, the solute density near ambient temperature, the solvent critical temperature, the solvent critical density, and the solvent reduced density. The total average absolute deviation (AAD%) of the prediction is 6.55% for 153 binary systems and 1968 data points over the solvent reduced temperature range of 1.00-1.78, the solvent reduced density range of 0.21-2.34, the solute molar mass range of 58.08-885.40 g/mol, and the solute ambient-temperature density range of 0.63-2.04 g/cm(3). Introduction of solute density into this new correlation makes it possible to predict with reasonable accuracy the diffusivities in supercritical fluids over a wide solute density range.

They have many beneficial health effects, such as antimicrobial, antiviral, antitumor, neuroactive and immunoactive activity. Several technologies for their production are now available such as chemical synthesis, biosynthesis and chemo-enzymatic peptide synthesis. For combining the advantages of chemical and enzymatic synthesis methods, chemo-enzymatic peptide synthesis has been attracting the interest of researchers in the peptide synthesis. In this paper, new progress in this method was reported. Enzymes, solvent systems and possible mechanisms were presented. The main strategies of chemo-enzymatic synthesis of peptides and modification of enzymes by using different methods were also discussed.

J	Du, WG; Warner, DA; Langkilde, T; Robbins, T; Shine, R				Du, Wei-Guo; Warner, Daniel A.; Langkilde, Tracy; Robbins, Travis; Shine, Richard			The Physiological Basis of Geographic Variation in Rates of Embryonic Development within a Widespread Lizard Species	AMERICAN NATURALIST			English	Article						countergradient variation; incubation period; heart rate; heart size; metabolic rate; Sceloporus undulatus	SCELOPORUS-UNDULATUS; COUNTERGRADIENT VARIATION; INCUBATION-TEMPERATURE; SEX DETERMINATION; HEART-RATE; GROWTH; METABOLISM; CONSEQUENCES; PERFORMANCE; HATCHLINGS	The duration of embryonic development (e. g., egg incubation period) is a critical life-history variable because it affects both the amount of time that an embryo is exposed to conditions within the nest and the seasonal timing of hatching. Variation in incubation periods among oviparous reptiles might result from variation in either the amount of embryogenesis completed before laying or the subsequent developmental rates of embryos. Selection on incubation duration could change either of those traits. We examined embryonic development of fence lizards (Sceloporus undulatus) from three populations (Indiana, Mississippi, and Florida) that occur at different latitudes and therefore experience different temperatures and season lengths. These data reveal countergradient variation: at identical temperatures in the laboratory, incubation periods were shorter for lizards from cooler areas. This variation was not related to stage at oviposition; eggs of all populations were laid at similar developmental stages. Instead, embryonic development proceeded more rapidly in cooler-climate populations, compensating for the delayed development caused by lower incubation temperatures in the field. The accelerated development appears to occur via an increase in heart mass (and, thus, stroke volume) in one population and an increase in heart rate in the other. Hence, superficially similar adaptations of embryonic developmental rate to local conditions may be generated by dissimilar proximate mechanisms.

Moreover, the abiotic stresses of NaCl, PEG 6000 and mannitol, and salicylic acid (SA), abscisic acid (ABA) and jasmonic acid (JA) induced higher GUS activity in the roots of P796 transgenic tobacco. This study provides a potential inducible root-specific promoter for transgenic plants.

The macroscopic properties of the two oligomers were systemically investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized optical microscopy (POM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), which revealed that the 3D (three-dimensional) assemblies of the two oligomers exhibited obvious differences. The two-dimensional assemblies (2D) of them were identified by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) on a highly oriented poyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface. Well-ordered monolayer assembly structures were fabricated by symmetric molecules (OT2Os), while the ordered dormain of asymmetric molecule (T(2)O(2)s) could not be clearly resolved. This system, as an excellent example, may provide guidance for the design of the novel p-n heterostructure oligomer and polymer.

J	Cao, SK				Cao Shanke			Everlasting Sorrows and Hatred of Human Beings: An Eco-ethical Study of Ibsen's Ghosts	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Ghosts; Henrik Ibsen; unbalanced social eco-ethics; everlasting painful abyss		Armed with eco-ethical theories, this paper is to discuss Ghosts by Norwegian playwright Ibsen. The paper holds that A) the minds of the characters in Ghosts have been distorted and become morbid, because they live in an impetuously anxious world stirred up by the unbalanced social eco-ethical ideologies; B) the unbalanced social eco-ethical ideology in relation to Ghosts refers to the actual home and the supporting systems because both human beings and their spirits have been ruined, damaged and become desolate due to their unlimitedly increasing desires; C) the so-called unbalanced social eco-ethical ideologies shown in Ghosts at last deconstruct the traditional ethics and morals so as to result in a terribly everlasting painful abyss for human beings.

Several new sufficient conditions are obtained ensuring the existence, uniqueness, and global exponential stability of periodic solution (i.e., stationary oscillation) for the addressed models based on inequality analysis techniques. The obtained results can be checked easily by the linear matrix inequality control toolbox in MATLAB. Finally, two numerical examples are given to show the effectiveness of our results.
