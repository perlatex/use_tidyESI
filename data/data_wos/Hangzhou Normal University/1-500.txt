Dihydroflavonol-4-reductase (DFR) catalyzes the first reaction leading to anthocyanins, and it is considered a key regulatory enzyme of anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants. In this research, we isolated three new DFR genes by searching the whole-genomic sequence data of Ginkgo biloba. The genes have similar structures and are clustered in the same scaffold. Sequence analyses of GbDFR proteins revealed that these GbDFRs have a closer relationship to Arabidopsis thaliana DFRs than previously identified GbDFRs. Expression analyses revealed that GbDFR4 and GbDFR6 were preferentially expressed in leaves and fruit, respectively. Young and mature leaves shared similar gene expression patterns, while fruit harvested in May had significantly higher expression levels of GbDFRs than fruit harvested in June. Transgenic tobacco plants ectopically overexpressing GbDFR genes showed higher DFR enzymatic activity levels, higher anthocyanin contents and darker flowers than the control. Ginkgo seedlings treated with NaCl showed increased total flavonoid and anthocyanin contents, and the expression levels of GbDFR genes were also induced. In contrast, UV-B irradiation increased the total flavonoid content but decreased both the anthocyanin content and GbDFR expression levels. A salicylic acid treatment induced and inhibited the total flavonoid content with and without light, respectively. In contrast, both the GbDFR expression levels and the anthocyanin content were inhibited by the salicylic acid treatment regardless of the light conditions. This research validated the functions of GbDFRs and expands our understanding of the environmental stress-response mechanisms of ginkgo trees.

Especially, the joint interaction of the nonlocal spatial average and delay results in the occurrence of the steady-state-Hopf bifurcation, which is the source of the spatio-temporal patterns. Applying the obtained results to the Logistic growth model subject to an Allee effect, the stability region, steady state bifurcation and steady-state-Hopf bifurcation are specifically determined in the plane of the diffusion coefficient and delay. Stable spatial patterns and the spatio-temporal patterns near the steady-state-Hopf bifurcation point are numerically obtained. (c) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, there are no reports on the characterization and especially their respective functional analysis of two IRF3 genes in some species. In this study, two IRF3 genes as well as their roles in the immune response were identified and investigated in Chinese giant salamander, Andrias davidianus. The complete open reading frames of AdIRF3A and AdIRF3B were 1, 113 bp and 1, 380 bp in length, encoding 370 and 459 amino acids, respectively. Both AdIRF3A and AdIRF3B protein contain an IRF and an IRF3 domain. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that AdIRF3s clustered together with other IRF3 proteins. Tissue distribution analysis showed that AdIRF3s were expressed in all tissues tested, with highest expression levels in blood. Both AdIRF3s actively responded to Chinese giant salamander iridovirus (GSIV) and poly (I:C) challenge in A. davidianus. AdIRF3A/B silencing significantly suppressed the DNA virus and viral RNA analog-induced expression of IFN-inducible genes. Luciferase reporter assay further confirmed the regulatory role of AdIRF3s in IFN signaling. These results provide new insights into the origin or evolution of IRF3 in amphibians and even in vertebrates.

Chrysanthemum (Chrysanthemum morifolium Ramat) is a popular ornamental herb with numerous biological activities, but its miRNAs and their roles in UV-B-induced active ingredient accumulation remain unexplored. High-throughput miRNA sequencing technology was used to identify miRNAs responsive to UV-B radiation. Four libraries were constructed from Chrysanthemum 'Xiaoyangju' leaves harvested at different time points under UV-B radiation. In total, 245 miRNAs belonging to 42 classical families were identified. Under UV-B treatment, 137 miRNAs showed differential expression, including 71 known and 67 novel miRNAs,. In addition, 1,779 unique target genes involving diverse biological processes were predicted for 80 known and 85 novel miRNAs. Three key glycolysis genes, Glyceraldehyde-3-Phosphate Dehydrogenase, Pyruvate Kinase and Glucan Endo-1,3-beta-D-Glucosidase, were predicated as potential target genes of miR396f-5p, PC-5p-294053_21 and miR397a, respectively. Among identified target genes, five key genes involved in the biosynthesis of chlorogenic acids and flavonoids were predicated as potential targets genes of MIR4367-p5, PC-3p-40855_284, MIR393b-p5, and PC-3p-114893_93. The expression of identified miRNAs relating to bioactive ingredient biosynthesis was significantly affected by UV-B radiation, suggesting a strong effect of UV-B radiation on bioactive ingredient accumulation in Chrysanthemum. Interestingly, several miRNAs related to flavonoids biosynthesis such as PC-3p-114893_93 and MIR4367-p5, were inhibited by short-term UV-B radiation, suggesting that the contribution of UV-B to flavonoids accumulation depends on a low dose of UV-B radiation.

However, recent studies have reported that PM2.5 may be associated with neurodegenerative diseases. The exact mechanism by which PM2.5 mediates neurotoxicity and cognitive dysfunction is still unclear. In the current work, we collected evidence supporting the association between PM2.5 exposure and development of neurodegenerative disorders. Evidence from epidemiological investigations, animal experiments, and ex vivo cell experiments showed that PM2.5 exposure may lead to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, neuronal apoptosis, synaptic damage and ultimately neurodegenerative diseases.

Material and Methods: This is a bioinformatics-based study. Microarray datasets of GSE6344, GSE781 and GSE53000 were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus database. Using meta-analysis, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between ccRCC and normal samples, followed by Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) function analyses. Then, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and modules were investigated. Furthermore, miRNAs-target gene regulatory network was constructed. Results: Total of 511 up-regulated and 444 down-regulated DEGs were determined in the present gene expression microarray data meta-analysis. These DEGs were enriched in functions like immune system process and pathways like Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. PPI network and eight modules were further constructed. A total of 10 outstanding DEGs including TYRO protein tyrosine kinase binding protein (TYROBP), interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) and PPARG co-activator 1 alpha (PPARGC1 A) were detected in PPI network. Furthermore, the miRNAs-target gene regulation analyses showed that miR-412 and miR-199b respectively targeted IRF7 and PPARGCIA to regulate the immune response in ccRCC. Conclusion: TYROBP, IRF7 and PPARGCIA might play important roles in ccRCC via taking part in the immune system process.

In each piece of the material, WSe2 nanostripes with a uniform width of 7-8 nm were parallelly arranged with a fixed gap of 3.7 nm to form a 2D sheet-like morphology. The entire piece of one WSe2 sheet is a single crystal WSe2 with its c-axis perpendicular to the sheet plane, making all the side surface of the nanostripes fully covered with crystal edge sites. After coating with carbon, 2D WSe2/C composite material displays much better electrochemical properties than the non-porous WSe2 particles, which suggests that 2D WSe2/C nanostripe array may be a promising candidate for reversible storage of Na-ion batteries.

Herein, for the first time, osmotic distillation is applied to concentrate and recover water-soluble ILs with a series of hydrophobic membranes. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) membrane with vertically oriented pores and stainless steel mesh were hydrophobically modified and then compared with commercial membranes to demonstrate the influence of different pore structures on the osmotic distillation concentration process. With the vapor pressure difference between two sides of the membrane being the driving force, the dilute aqueous solutions of ILs can be concentrated to about 84 wt% after 24 h with a water flux of 7.8 kg m(-2) h(-1). It is also able to achieve ultra-high rejections to ILs and MgCl2 (>99.99%) by this osmotic distillation process. Although there exists a limitation for dewatering the ILs solutions with very high concentrations and thus the final ILs purity cannot reach 100%, this method is promising for practical applications benefiting from its high rejection to ions, easy operability at ambient temperature and remarkable universality in terms of hydrophobic membranes used.

However, achieving a hydrogel possessed splendid mechanical performance with well trade-off between tensile strength and toughness is highly demanded due to the mechanical weakness of conventional hydrogel. Herein, we report a novel kind of nanocomposite hydrogel developed by integrating chitosan decorated halloysite nanotubes (CS-f-HNTs) into dual cross-linked structure composed of chemical and Fe3+ induced ionically cross-linked network. Combining the nanoparticle reinforcement with physical interactions including hydrogen bonds among polymer chains and ionic coordination interaction between Fe3+ ions and functional groups on chitosan chains and the copolymer chains, the hydrogel exhibits extraordinary and balanced mechanical performance, including high strength (3.06 MPa), outstanding stretchability (>2000%) and superior toughness (47.6 MJ m(-3)) in which water content remains similar to 80 wt%. Based on microstructure observation and dynamic mechanical behavior analysis, we demonstrated that the addition of CS-f-HNTs effectively bridged polymer chains via physical interactions and strengthened dual cross-linked network, leading to significant improved mechanical properties. Moreover, the hydrogels also possessed remarkable self-recoverability (97.9% for small strain (200%) and 91.5% for large strain (1000%)) at room temperature and the related mechanism was discussed. The strategy developed herein may provide a newfound avenue in the design and development of strong and tough hydrogel for promising applications in loading-bearing structural materials.

For the system without diffusion, the existence, stability and Hopf bifurcation of the positive equilibrium are explicitly determined. It is shown that the hunting cooperation affects not only the existence of the positive equilibrium but also the stability. For the diffusive system, the stability and cross-diffusion driven Turing instability are investigated according to the relationship of the self-diffusion and the cross-diffusion coefficients. Stability and cross-diffusion instability regions are theoretically determined in the plane of the cross-diffusion coefficients. The technique of multiple time scale is employed to deduce the amplitude equation of Turing bifurcation and then pattern dynamics driven by the cross-diffusion is also investigated by the corresponding amplitude equation.

The difference between the two models lies in the inclusion or omission of the effect of involvement. Particular attention is focused on the effects due to the cell-to-cell transmission and the effect of the involvement. We investigate the local and global stability of equilibria of the two models and give a comparison. We derive the existence condition for Hopf bifurcation and prove no Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation in this system. In particular, we show that the system exhibits the recurrence phenomenon, yielding complex dynamical behavior. It is also shown that the effect of the involvement is the main cause of the periodic symptoms in HIV or malaria disease. Moreover, it is shown that the increase of cell-to-cell interaction may be the main factor causing Hopf bifurcation to disappear, and thus eliminating oscillation behavior. Finally, numerical simulations are present to demonstrate our theoretical results. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sleep duration, sleep quality, and trait self-regulation are thought to be linked to this association. The present study aimed to examine the mediating roles of sleep duration and quality and the moderating role of trait self-regulation between MPA and daily cognitive failures. A total of 1721 secondary school students were recruited to complete four self-reported questionnaires. The model results indicated that sleep quality (but not sleep duration) partially mediated the association between MPA and daily cognitive failures, and high levels of trait self-regulation could attenuate the potential impact of MPA on daily cognitive failures through sleep quality. Overall, these findings address the issue of how and when MPA is linked with cognitive performance in daily life, which can advance a better understanding of the negative consequences induced by MPA. Limitations and implications are discussed.

However, the trade-off between poor strength/toughness and high electrical resistance of the hydrogels severely hamper their practical application in diverse areas. In this work, we reported a facile and effective strategy for fabricating mechanically robust and electrically conductive nanocomposite hydrogels via incorporating chitosan in-situ grafted magnetite nanoparticles combined with multiple ionic-covalent interactions. The obtained nanocomposite hydrogel delivers a remarkable mechanical strength up to 2.33 MPa and high toughness of 18.18 MJ m(-3) at a relatively high water content (80 wt%). Based on the creep/ recovery experimental results and analysis (Burger's model and Weibull distribution function), the effect of multiple ionic-covalent interactions among the double-networks and chitosan in-situ grafted nanoparticles on the viscoelastic behavior of the hydrogel was discussed and clarified. In addition, the resultant nanocomposite hydrogel exhibits sensitive strain-induced resistance change under both compressive and tensile stress as well as outstanding stability and repeatability, which can accurately and repeatedly monitor both large mechanical deformation (e.g. tensile strain up to 600%) and human behaviors (e.g., motions of joints and facial expressions). This study offers a new scenario to design and develop a mechanically robust hydrogel with sensitive strainresponsive resistance, showing potential applications in electric skin, motion detection, wearable electronics, etc.	[Li, Shi-Neng; Li, Baoqiang; Feng, Yujie; Jia, Dechang; Zhou, Yu] Harbin Inst Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Yu, Zhi-Ran; Gong, Li-Xiu; Xia, Qiao-Qi; Tang, Long-Cheng] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Key Lab Organosilicon Chem & Mat Technol, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 311121, Peoples R China; [Li, Shi-Neng; Li, Baoqiang; Jia, Dechang; Zhou, Yu] Harbin Inst Technol, Key Lab Adv Struct Funct Integrat Mat & Green Mfg, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China; [Tang, Long-Cheng] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Key Lab Silicone Mat Technol Zhejiang Prov, Hangzhou 311121, Peoples R China	Li, BQ (reprint author), Harbin Inst Technol, Inst Adv Ceram, State Key Lab Urban Water Resource & Environm, Harbin 150001, Peoples R China.; Tang, LC (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Key Lab Organosilicon Chem & Mat Technol, Minist Educ, Hangzhou 311121, Peoples R China.	libq@hit.edu.cn; lctang@hznu.edu.cn			National Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [51972086, 51621091, 51973047]; State Key Laboratory of Urban Water Resource and Environment of Harbin Institute of Technology [2019TS01]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science FoundationNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LY15E030015, LY18E030005]; Project for the Science and Technology Program of Hangzhou [20191203B16, 20180533B01]	tThe authors thank F.Z.

SRpf acclimation significantly improved combined removal of phenol and nutrients. Moreover, the Illumina high-throughput sequencing analysis revealed that the SRpf boosted bacteria diversity, which enhanced the stability of the system under phenol stress. Addition of SRpf increased the abundances of Actinobacteria and Proteobacteria phylawhich are involved in nutrient and phenol removal. Specifically, SRpf promoted Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira which participate in nitrification, family Comamonadaceae, genera Dechloromonas and Pseudomonas involved in denitrification, and Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas and Rhodocycluswhich remove phosphorus elements. Moreover, the abundances of Bacillus and Klebsiella responsible for phenol removal as well as Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter were significantly increased after SRpf acclimation. These results show that SBR combined with SRpf acclimation provide optimal nutrient and phenol removal. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, an extremely simple water-based coating approach is proposed to prepare mechanically flexible, super-hydrophobic and flame-retardant polyurethane (PU) foam nanocomposites with high-efficiency fire warning response. The hybrid ammonium polyphosphate (APP)/graphene oxide (GO) is decorated onto the PU foam surface via electrostatic interactions followed by surface silane functionalization. Interestingly, the silane and APP molecules present selective distributions on the GO and thus form micro-/nano- rough surface with low water affinity to achieve super-hydrophobicity (e.g. water contact angle of similar to 158.4 degrees). Meanwhile, such hybrid APP/GO/silane coatings produce synergistic flame resistance for the PU foam materials, which is attributed to the formation of compact and uniform P-Si elements co-covered rGO layer on the foam surface. Further, the hybrid coatings can provide high-efficiency fire warning response under complicated conditions, e.g. flame detection response time of only similar to 2.0 s and excellent fire early warning time in pre-combustion (e.g. 11.2 s at 300 degrees C). Therefore, this work provides new perspectives to design and develop multi-functional coatings for fire safety and prevention applications.

By using the method of characteristics, we show that the smooth solutions for the spherically symmetric variational wave equation break down in finite time, even for an arbitrarily small initial energy. The key point is the energy equation derived from the variational wave equation, which is also used to establish the existence of energy-conservative weak solutions in a finite period.

The nitrogen loading rates (NLR) of two anammox reactors were increased to 60.19 g N L-1 d(-1) (R-1) and 24.32 g N L-1 d(-1) (R-2), through reducing hydraulic retention time (HRT) and increasing ammonium concentration. Afterwards, the reactors were operated in series at variable temperatures (6.15-34.13 degrees C) for 240 days to treat the synthetic high-ammonium containing wastewater, with the effluent of R-1 pumping into R-2 as influent. Finally, the advanced treatment of the high-strength ammonium wastewater (490 mg NH4+-N L-1 and 980 mg TN L-1) was successfully achieved, and nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) maintained at 83.25 +/- 9.48%. During the whole operational period (400 days), the richness and diversity of microbial community in two reactors generally increased, and Candidatus Kuenenia was identified as the dominant anammox bacterium. In serial-operation phase, the dominant phylum changed from Planctomycetes to Proteobacteria, and the average relative abundance of Proteobacteria 39.61% in R-1 and 48.32% in R-2. Variations in bacterial abundances and distributions were closely related to the substrate concentration and temperature. Correspondingly, the expression levels of most functional genes were reduced by low temperature, and were slightly different in settling, middle and floating sludge. Nitrogen transformation pathway in each phase was also determined based on the gene expression levels, and main pathways in both reactors included anammox and first step of denitrification (NO3--> NO2-). All findings of this study provide new insights into the potential application of the two-stage anammox process to treat high-strength ammonium wastewater under variable temperature conditions.

Females exhibited a high degree of Cd uptake and root-to-shoot translocation, while males showed extensive Cd accumulation in roots, elevated antioxidative capacity, and effective cellular and bark Cd sequestration. Our study also found that Cd is largely located in epidermal and cortical tissues of male roots and leaves, while in females, more Cd was present in vascular tissues of roots and leaves, as well as in leaf mesophyll. In addition, the distributions of sulphur (S) and phosphorus (P) were very similar as that of Cd in males, but the associations were weak in females. Scanning electron microscopy and energy spectroscopy analyses suggested that the amounts of tissue Cd were positively correlated with P and S amounts in males, but not in females (a weak correlation between S and Cd). Transcriptional data suggested that Cd stress promoted the upregulation of genes related to Cd uptake and translocation in females, and that of genes related to cell wall biosynthesis, metal tolerance and secondary metabolism in males. Our results indicated that coordinated physiological, microstructural and transcriptional responses to Cd stress endowed superior Cd tolerance in males compared with females, and provided new insights into mechanisms underlying sexually differential responses to Cd stress.

Drought is a critical threat to forests, particularly to young plantation forests. Temporal changes in competition combined with the effects of drought may dramatically influence the physiological traits of plants. Cunninghamia lanceolata plants exposed to intra-specific competition and no-competition conditions were investigated under two soil water levels (well-watered and drought). Changes in plant-plant competition relationships and nitrogen uptake rates were measured at different harvest times. The effects of drought and plant competition on physiological traits, for example, leaf nitrogen allocation, delta C-1(3), and levels of abscisic acid (ABA), indole acetic acid (IAA) and jasmonic acid (JA), were also explored. Our results indicated that C. lanceolata shifted from intense neighbor competition to facilitation under well-watered conditions, whereas under drought neighbor competition became much stronger at the second harvest compared to the first harvest. Strong competition significantly decreased N uptake under drought. Leaf NH4+, NO3- and N allocation to water-soluble proteins increased under drought at the first harvest, but significantly declined under prolonged drought. Leaf, stem and root starch concentrations were enhanced by drought. However, during prolonged drought, the root starch concentrations, leaf delta C-13, leaf ABA and starch content of C. lanceolata were much lower under strong neighbor competition than in no-competition conditions, which demonstrated that the combined effects of drought and strong competition were more harmful to plant growth and survival compared to single effects. Our study demonstrated that drought combined with competition strongly affected the N uptake, N allocation and physiological traits of plants. Intense competition imposed by neighbors is a great threat to the growth and survival of young C. lanceolata plantations under prolonged drought.

However, sex-specific differences in responses to drought, phosphorus (P) shortage or their combination are less known. In our study, impacts of drought, P shortage and their combination on the performance of Populus cathayana males and females were investigated. Drought and P deficiency caused a greater negative impact on female growth than on male growth. P application ameliorated the more negative effect of drought on the shoot dry matter accumulation and P concentration in male leaves, while smaller effects were observed in females. The concentration of citrate in the rhizosphere of males was higher under drought combined with P application than under adequate water availability, and the increase was greater in males than in females. Males also showed a higher abundance of main soil microbial groups, including bacteria, actinomycetes, arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), and Gram + and Gram- bacteria in the rhizosphere, resulting in a more resistant microhabitat. In contrast, the abundance of bacteria and AMF was less in the rhizosphere of females exposed to stress conditions, while saprophytic fungi increased significantly. P enhanced drought resistance more in stress-resistant males but less in females under relatively severe drought stress. Increased drought resistance by P in males might be associated with greater plasticity in rhizosphere processes when compared with females.

Combined TI-RADS classification with the features of color Doppler ultrasound and Doppler blood flow parameters for each nodule, we tried to diagnose TN between benign and malignant nodules so as to provide clinical physicians a more appropriate method and decision-making strategy for patients with of TN by ultrasound findings. The pulse Doppler technique was used to measure the peak systolic velocity (PSV) and resistance index (RI) of the blood flow within the nodule or closely around. The final pathology results were compared with all the ultrasound test. The diagnostic coincidence rates for B&M-TN were statistically compared by single two-dimensional ultrasound or by single color Doppler flow imaging or by combined technique of both. It can be seen that the combination strategy can optimize the coincidence rate of clinical diagnosis of B&M-TN. Therefore, the differential diagnosis of TN by high-frequency ultrasound TI-RADS classification combined with color Doppler blood flow parameters deserves our attention and further study.

We also show that if T-phi is complex symmetric, then the curve phi vertical bar(T) (T) must be nowhere winding. Furthermore, the spectrum and invertibility of complex symmetric Toeplitz operators are described. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier Inc.

This work proposed and evaluated the feasibility of an anammox consortia preservation strategy, in which the anammox sludge was transformed into intermediate anoxic sulfide oxidation (ASO) functional microorganisms. Initially, the ASO process was successfully started up by inoculating anammox sludge and the overall sulfide and nitrate removal rates stabilized at 57.5 +/- 0.22 and 10.0 +/- 0.18 kgm(-3) day(-1), respectively. Then, the bioreactor function was reversely transformed into anammox, whose nitrogen removal rate reached 1.68 kgm(-3) day(-1). Granule characteristics analysis revealed that both biomass and extracellular polymeric substance content returned to their original states after the reverse start-up. Although the population of Candidatus_Kuenenia was greatly declined during ASO process, its richness was successfully recovered after the reverse start-up of the anammox process. The inferred metagenomes analysis demonstrated that the shifts in functional microorganisms were related to variation in the main metabolic pathways. The specific activities of anammox and ASO both are regarded as key indicators for the successful start-up of bioreactor. This work revealed a novel technique for the preservation of anammox consortia and might be a potential strategy for overcoming the drawback of long start-up time. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, as proof of concept, we put forward a bifunctional interface of Ni(OH)(2)/Pt cocatalyst loaded on anatase TiO2 through a selective deposition process. Ni(OH)(2)/Pt interface facilitates H2O adsorption by providing two adsorption sites: O is selectively adsorbed on Ni(OH)(2) and H adsorbed on metallic Pt. Beyond that, Ni(OH)(2)/Pt interface also extends light absorption range of TiO2 to visible light region and accelerates the separation of photo-generated electrons/holes for semiconductor TiO2. Benefiting from this interfacial engineering in semiconductor, the visible-light driven hydrogen production performance of the as-obtained Ni(OH)(2)/Pt/TiO2 sample is greatly boosted with a rate of 5875 mmol g(-1) h(-1), 2.6 times higher than that of Pt/TiO2.

BESIII Collaboration	Model-independent determination of the relative strong-phase difference between D-0 and (D)over-bar(0) -> K-S,L(0)pi(+)pi(-) and its impact on the measurement of the CKM angle gamma/phi(3)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DECAYS	Crucial inputs for a variety of CP-violation studies can be determined through the analysis of pairs of quantum-entangled neutral D mesons, which are produced in the decay of the psi(3770) resonance. The relative strong-phase parameters between D-0 and (D) over bar (0) in the decays D-0 -> K-S,L(0)pi(+)pi(-) are studied using 2.93 fb(-1) of e(+)e(-) annihilation data delivered by the BEPCII collider and collected by the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. Results are presented in regions of the phase space of the decay. These are the most precise measurements to date of the strong-phase parameters in D-0 -> K-S,L(0)pi(+)pi(-) decays. Using these parameters, the associated uncertainty on the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle gamma/phi(3) is expected to be between 0.7 degrees and 1.2 degrees for an analysis using the decay B-+/- -> DK +/-, D -> K-S(0)pi(+)pi(-), where D represents a superposition of D-0 and (D) over bar (0) states. This is a factor of 3 smaller than that achievable with previous measurements. Furthermore, these results provide valuable input for charm-mixing studies, other measurements of CP violation, and the measurement of strong-phase parameters for other D-decay modes.

BESIII Collaboration	Determination of Strong-Phase Parameters in D -> K-S,L(0)pi(+)pi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							CP-VIOLATION; DECAYS	We report the most precise measurements to date of the strong-phase parameters between D-0 and (D) over bar (0) decays to K-S,L(0)pi(+)pi(-) using a sample of 2.93 fb(-1) of e(+) e(-) annihilation data collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. Our results provide the key inputs for a binned model-independent determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa angle gamma/phi(3) with B decays. Using our results, the decay model sensitivity to the gamma/phi(3 )measurement is expected to be between 0.7 degrees and 1.2 degrees, approximately a factor of three smaller than that achievable with previous measurements, based on the studies of the simulated data. The improved precision of this work ensures that measurements of gamma/phi(3) will not be limited by knowledge of strong phases for the next decade. Furthermore, our results provide critical input for other flavor-physics investigations, including charm mixing, other measurements of CP violation, and the measurement of strong-phase parameters for other D-decay modes.

Here, we related HA adaptive genetic variants in three gene loci (EGLN1, EPAS1, and PPARA) to interindividual variance in a set of physiological characteristics, neuropsychological tests, and topological attributes of large-scale structural and functional brain networks in 135 indigenous Tibetan highlanders. Analyses of individual HA adaptive single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) revealed that specific SNPs selectively modulated physiological characteristics (erythrocyte level, ratio between forced expiratory volume in the first second to forced vital capacity, arterial oxygen saturation, and heart rate) and structural network centrality (the left anterior orbital gyrus) with no effects on neuropsychology or functional brain networks. Further analyses of genetic adaptive scores, which summarized the overall degree of genetic adaptation to HA, revealed significant correlations only with structural brain networks with respect to local interconnectivity of the whole networks, intermodule communication between the right frontal and parietal module and the left occipital module, nodal centrality in several frontal regions, and connectivity strength of a subnetwork predominantly involving in intramodule edges in the right temporal and occipital module. Moreover, the associations were dependent on gene loci, weight types, or topological scales. Together, these findings shed new light on genotype-phenotype interactions under HA hypoxia and have important implications for developing new strategies to optimize organism and tissue responses to chronic hypoxia induced by extreme environments or diseases.

Simulation of the phase I oxidative metabolism was carried out in an electrochemical reactor equipped with a glassy carbon working electrode. The phase II reactivity of the generated oxidative products towards biomolecules (such as glutathione) was investigated by ways of covalent adduct formation experiments. The results obtained by EC/MS were compared with well-known in vitro studies by conducting rat liver microsome incubations. Structures of the electrochemically produced metabolites were identified by accurate mass measurement and previously results in vivo metabolites. It was indicated that the electrochemical oxidation was in good accordance with similar products found in vivo experiments.

It also investigates whether a gap exists between the two images. Design/methodology/approach - The best-rated boutique luxury hotel in Hong Kong is selected as the case hotel. Through the interpretation and discussion of high-frequency wordlists and semantic co-occurrence network charts, major topics in the hotel's self-presented image and customers' perceived image are identified accordingly. Findings - Five dimensions (event making, exquisite food, excellent amenities and services, special function venue and promotion) used by hotels to form their boutique luxury image are recognised. Between hotels' self-positioned image and customers' perceived images, minor similarities such as the recognition of excellent amenities and services were confirmed but considerable differences were identified, indicating the ineffective marketing by the boutique luxury hotel despite its success in terms of ranking. Managerial suggestions on how to address the image discrepancy were proposed. Originality/value - This study contributes insights into hotel image discrepancy among social media platforms in luxury hotel segments by adding the category of boutique luxury hotels. It also identifies the implications for enhancing the development of a hotel image to meet customers' needs and expectations.

Among the catalysts examined, phosphomolybdic acid (PMA) was found to greatly accelerate the reaction in NMP, at temperatures ranging from 220 to 300 degrees C. This method was found to be useful for preparing several intermediates previously reported in the literature using precious metal catalysts such as Au(I), Ag(I), and Pt(II). Additionally, substrates bearing bromo and nitro groups on the aryl portion required careful tailoring of the reaction conditions to avoid complex product profiles. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

The responses of anammox to a typical antibiotic (spiramycin, SPM) with different exposure strategies (elevating-concentration strategy in R-1 and repeated-exposure strategy in R-2) were evaluated on the aspects of general performance, microbial community and genes. Results showed that anammox bacteria could adapt to low concentrations (<= 1 mg L-1) of SPM, while high-concentration (>= 3 mg L-1) SPM showed inhibitory influences. The nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) quickly decreased from 90.21% to 76.29% when R-1 was exposed to 5 mg L-1 SPM, and then returned to a higher level within a short period. On the contrary, R-2 could not recover with the inhibition of 5 mg L-1 SPM, and the abundance of Planctomycetes declined from 18.96% to 15.41% on Day 105. Combined with the changes in key genes and functional bacteria, R-1 had a relatively stable performance and higher resistance to SPM, indicating the elevating-concentration strategy might be more effective to gain the tolerance of anammox process to high-concentration antibiotics. The present study provides a guide for the stable operation of anammox process treating antibiotic-containing wastewaters. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This study aimed to clarify the responses of bacterial communities to tourism development targeted the Xixi National Wetland Park, China. By analyzing the diversity, composition, assembly pattern, and environmental drivers of bacterial communities, we found that tourism development considerably affected the water quality, which further decreased the alpha-diversity but increased the beta-diversity in open areas for landscaping and recreation. Specifically, there was higher Simpson dissimilarity across functional wetland areas, indicating that species replacement mainly explained beta-diversity patterns of bacterial communities. RDA analysis and ecological processes quantification further suggested that TOC and TC were the major factors in the open areas driving bacterial communities in water and sediment, respectively. Also, typical anti-disturbance taxa (Gammaproteobacteria) and potential pathogens (Bacillus) were enriched in the wetlands under more anthropogenic disturbances. Findings of the present study highlighted the effects of tourism development on bacterial communities resulted in obvious spatial variation in the Xixi National Wetland Park. This study gives us useful information for ecological assessments of urban wetlands, and further can provide references in making appropriate strategies to manage wetland ecosystems.

BESIII Collaboration	First Observation of D+ -> eta mu(+)nu(mu) and Measurement of Its Decay Dynamics	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							SEMILEPTONIC-B; E(+)E(-); HEAVY	By analyzing a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb(-1) collected at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure for the first time the absolute branching fraction of the D+ -> eta mu(+) nu(mu) decay to be BD+ ->eta mu+nu mu = (10.4 +/- 1.0(stat) +/- 0.5(syst)) x 10(-4). Using the world averaged value of BD+ ->eta e+nu e, the ratio of the two branching fractions is determined to be = BD+ ->eta mu+nu mu/BD+ ->eta e+nu e =0.91 +/- 0.13((stat+syst)), which agrees with the theoretical expectation of lepton flavor universality within uncertainty. By studying the differential decay rates in five four-momentum transfer intervals, we obtain the product of the hadronic form factor f(+)(eta)(0) and the c -> d Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element vertical bar V-cd vertical bar to be f(+)(eta)(0)vertical bar V-cd vertical bar = 0.087 +/- 0.008(stat) +/- 0.002(syst). Taking the input of vertical bar V-cd vertical bar from the global fit in the standard model, we determine f(+)(eta)(0) = 0.39 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.01(syst). On the other hand, using the value of f(+)(eta)(0) calculated in theory, we find vertical bar V-cd vertical bar= 0.242 +/- 0.022(stat )+/- 0.006(syst) +/- 0.033(theory).

However, the modulatory effects of rTMS at different frequencies remain unclear. Here, we employed finger-tapping task-based fMRI to investigate alterations in activation of the sensorimotor network after the application of rTMS over the left M1 at different frequencies. Materials and Methods Forty-five right-handed healthy participants were randomly divided into three groups by rTMS frequency (HF, high-frequency, 3 Hz; LF, low-frequency, 1 Hz; and SHAM) and underwent two task-fMRI sessions (RH, finger-tapping with right index finger; LH, finger-tapping with left index finger) before and after applying rTMS over the left M1. We defined regions of interest (ROIs) in the sensorimotor network based on group-level activation maps (pre-rTMS) from RH and LH tasks and calculated the percentage signal change (PSC) for each ROI. We then assessed the differences of PSC within HF or LF groups and between groups. Results Application of rTMS at different frequencies resulted in a change in activation of several areas of the sensorimotor network. We observed the increased PSC in M1 after high-frequency stimulation, while we detected the reduced PSC in the primary sensory cortex (S1), ventral premotor cortex (PMv), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), and putamen after low-frequency stimulation. Moreover, the PSC in the SMA, dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), and putamen in the HF group was higher than in the LF group after stimulation. Conclusion Our findings suggested that activation alterations within sensorimotor network are dependent on the frequency of rTMS. Therefore, our findings contribute to understanding the effects of rTMS on brain activation in healthy individuals and ultimately may further help to suggest mechanisms of how rTMS could be employed as a therapeutic tool.

The naturalised metaphysics of structural realism has been defined in terms of unification of sciences. The unification program has been carried out nicely in fields of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. But for the structural realist metaphysics to receive a recommendation, the unification program needs to be extended to the fields of especial sciences. Our aim in the paper is twofold. On the one hand, we present a structural realist theory of the brain that is well-supported by the best theories of computational neurosciences. On the other hand, and at the same time, we provide further reason for being optimistic about the structural realism metaphysical claim which is based on the idea of unification in sciences.

This paper investigates the effects of CE strategy on firm performance at both overall and individual sub-category (investing in R&D, brand equity, organisational capital and human capital) levels with Chinese listed companies over the period 2010 to 2018. The empirical results indicate two points. (1) Adopting CE strategies has a positive effect on firm performance. When investigating the influence of the specific sub-category, only investing in R&D and human capital influences firm performance significantly, while the effects of investing in brand equity and organisational capital are insignificant. (2) The effects of CE strategy and its sub-categories on firm performance exist heterogeneity across firm ownership and industry context. Specifically, the effect of CE strategy in state-owned (manufacturing) firms is larger than that in privately-owned (service) firms; state-owned firms' performance is driven by R&D investment, while privately-owned firms' performance is driven by R&D and human capital investment; manufacturing firms' performance is driven by R&D and brand equity investment, while service firms' performance is driven by human capital investment.

However, the size range of lipoprotein particles such as high density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) overlap that of EVs, making it difficult to remove lipoproteins from EVs. Here, we propose a method for the high efficiency separation of EVs in plasma using agarose gel electrophoresis based on their differences in size and zeta potential properties. Electrophoresis track assays revealed that EVs propagate more slowly than HDL but more quickly than LDL and VLDL in 1% agarose gel with pH 7.4 Tris-Acetate-EDTA (TAE) buffer. The size and morphology of the electrophoresis-recovered products were characterized to be consistent with typical EVs. In addition, the biological function of recovered EVs was investigated with cell uptake tests. The feasibility of this method was further verified with human plasma samples. In summary, this technique has the potential to become a convenient and efficient approach for high-purity EV separation.

J	Pan, Y; Zhang, X				Pan, Yi; Zhang, Xue			Visual working memory enhances target discrimination accuracy with single-item displays	ATTENTION PERCEPTION & PSYCHOPHYSICS			English	Article; Early Access						Visual working memory; Visual perception; Target signal; Priming	ATTENTION; GUIDANCE; PERCEPTION; REVEALS; NOISE	The maintenance of information in visual working memory has been shown to bias the concurrent processing in favor of matching visual input. The present study aimed to examine whether this bias can act at an early stage of processing to enhance target feature perception in single-item displays. Participants were sequentially presented with two distinct colored stimuli as memory samples and a retro-cue indicating which of the two samples should be maintained for subsequent memory test. During the retention interval, they had to discriminate the gap orientation of a Landolt target presented through a single visual stimulus that could match one or neither of the two samples. Across two experiments, we consistently found that discrimination performance was more accurate when the Landolt target was situated within a stimulus that matched the sample being retained in visual working memory, as compared with when the target was not. This effect cannot be attributed to the mechanism of passive priming, because we failed to observe priming effects when the stimulus containing the target matched the sample that was retro-cued to be irrelevant to the working memory task, as compared to when the stimulus matched neither sample. Given the fact that target stimuli were presented in single-item displays wherein external noise was precluded, the present findings demonstrate that the working memory bias of visual attention operating in the absence of stimulus competition facilitates early perceptual processing at the attended location via signal enhancement.

The target analyses were detected by ultra high performance chromatography coupled with time-of-flight MS. Experimental conditions for MSPD microextraction were optimized by the Box-Behnken design of the response surface methodology. The optimal conditions were as follows: 20 mg adsorbent, 80% methanol-water solution for elution, 60 s grinding time, and the MOF-808 as the adsorbent. With the final optimized method, the calibration curves for five saponins showed good linearity (R-2 > 0.998) within range of 0.01-100 mu g/mL. In addition, analytical recoveries ranged from 87.04 to 103.78%, with the RSD below 5%. The limit of detection and LOQ range from 0.087 to 0.114 mu g/mL and 0.292 to 0.379 mu g/mL, respectively. Compared with the traditional extraction method and published methods, the newly MOF-assisted MSPD extract exhibited higher extraction efficiency, simpler operation, and provided a cleaner extract with low consumption of organic reagents that was applied for rapid evaluation and quality control of active compounds from plants.

In this case report, we described a case of SARS-CoV-2 infection with the clinical course for more than 2 months. This patient had recovered from pneumonia after treatment. The viral RNA of throat swabs became negative and the viral-specific antibodies were produced during the recovery period. However, the viral RNA reappeared and additionally persisted in throat swabs for more than 40 days. In addition, the viral RNA was detected in multiple types of specimens with extremely high titers in the saliva. In conclusion, these findings indicate that SARS-CoV-2 can cause a long clinical course. The coexistence of viral RNA and viral-specific antibodies may imply an immune evasion of SARS-CoV-2 from the host's immune system.

Participants were 971 young and middle-aged urban residents in six developed cities of Yangtze River Delta. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the potential factor structure of the mental composite scale. Confirmatory factor analysis was employed to evaluate the goodness of fit of the factor structure model. And logistic regression model was conducted to analyze the demographic effect. The results showed that the mental composite scale had a satisfactory reliability and validity, and the three-factor structure model had an acceptable goodness of fit. Furthermore, it indicated that annual income was the significant indicator of mental health. Participants who had earned between RMB50,000 - RMB100,000 annually were more likely to report better mental health than those with annual income less than RMB10,000. It demonstrated therefore that the mental composite scale selected from the WHOQOL-BREF was an appropriate instrument to measure the mental health of Chinese urban residents in the Yangtze River Delta region.

Although mechanistic studies have been conducted on the pathogenesis of CRC, the molecular mechanism of CRC tumorigenesis remains unclear. In the present study, the weighted gene co-expression network analysis was performed for the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) dataset GSE87211, in order to analyze the key modules involved in the pathogenesis of CRC. Next, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analyses were performed on the key module genes to analyze the functional pathways involved. The hub genes were screened using the Cytoscape platform and verified by a second GEO dataset, GSE21510. Finally, 10 hub genes were identified in 2 key modules (the green and brown modules) as the genes most significantly associated with the tumorigenesis of CRC. The 5 hub genes from the green module included collagen type I alpha 1 chain, collagen type XII alpha 1 chain, collagen triple helix repeat containing 1, inhibin subunit beta a (INHBA) and chromobox 2 (CBX2), while the 5 hub genes from the brown module included bestrophin 2 (BEST2), carbonic anhydrase 2, glucagon, solute carrier family 4 member 4 and gliomedin. The 2 key modules with the 10 hub genes identified may regulate the occurrence and development of CRC through the extracellular matrix pathway, PI3K-Akt and chemokine signaling pathways, thus providing a reference for understanding the complex mechanism of tumorigenesis in CRC. Of note, few studies have reported the pathogenesis of CRC with the 3 identified hub genes, INHBA, CBX2 and BEST2. Further investigation of the molecular mechanism of these genes in CRC is recommended.

Although its popularity has been increasing worldwide, studies on private social dining, especially its influence on tourism, are limited. The present work aims to explore tourists' experiences using private social dining as a context by constructing the dimensions for tourist experience. A qualitative research method is utilized to analyze reviews from top service providers in three popular destinations. Results confirm seven dimensions of the three types of experience existing in tourists' private social dining experiences, which affect tourist satisfaction. These results lay the foundation for future studies.

However, flake graphite has high aspect ratio and shows anisotropic thermal conductivity. In this work, spherical graphite (SG) was used to adjust the packing and orientation of FG to enhance the thermal conductivity. It was found that the addition of 5 wt% SG simultaneously enhances both in-plane and through-plane thermal conductivity of polypropylene (PP)/FG/SG composites when the total filler content is 50 wt%. Moreover, the mechanical properties of the composite at this SG loading are also in its maximum. It is considered that small amount of SG fills the vacancies of FG and induces the denser packing of the fillers in the matrix. At the same time, the addition of SG leads to the anisotropic orientation of the FG in the plane during the hot press molding.

Promoting Honesty Through Overheard Conversations	DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						children; honesty; lying; overheard conversations; evaluative statements	YOUNG-CHILDREN; STORIES; WORDS	Although there is widespread acknowledgment that children acquire social and moral values during development via socialization processes, few plausible mechanisms have been systematically evaluated. In the present research, we examine the effectiveness of 1 potential mechanism: overheard conversations about the moral behavior of others. We examine this issue with reference to the important social value of honesty. Across 3 preregistered studies, preschool-age children in China (total N = 276) were presented with a version of the temptation resistance paradigm in which they were first given an opportunity to cheat by peeking at the answer in a guessing game and were then asked whether they had cheated. Study 1 included both 3- and 5-year-olds, and Studies 2 and 3 included 5-year-olds only. In Study 1 children were more likely to truthfully confess to peeking if they had previously overheard 2 adults say that another child's confession made them happy. An increase in truthful confessions was also seen in Study 2, even though this time the adult who asked about peeking had not been present for the overheard conversation. In Study 3, children were presented with an overheard conversation that lacked any emotion-related language, and the effect was seen once again. Taken together, these findings suggest that overheard conversations can be used to promote truth telling. More broadly, the findings suggest that children realize the attitudes adults express about others can have implications for their own behavior and can identify these attitudes, even when they are not the target of the communication.

It then introduces the notion of weak sharp solution for equilibrium problems which is analogous to the linear conditioning notion. This new notion generalizes and unifies the notion of weak sharp minima for optimization problems as well as the notion of weak sharp solutions for variational inequality problems. Some sufficient conditions and characterizations of weak sharpness are also presented. Finally, we study the finite convergence property of sequences generated by some algorithms for solving equilibrium problems under linear conditioning and weak shapness assumptions. An upper bound of the number of iterations by which the sequence generated by proximal point algorithm converges to a solution of equilibrium problems is also given.

Based on these expression of the coefficients, we discuss the limit cycle bifurcations and obtain more number of limit cycles which bifurcate from the family of periodic orbits near the homoclinic loop and the centre. Finally, as an application of our main results we study limit cycle bifurcation of a (m + 1)th order Lienard system with an elliptic Hamiltonian function of degree 4, and improve the lower bound of the maximal number of the isolated zeros of the related Abelian integral for any m >= 4.

This pollutant is ubiquitous in water and environments. Although PFOA is toxic to fishes, the precise immunotoxicological mechanism remains unclear. In this study, HPLC-MS analysis proved that PFOA can accumulate in the spleen of zebrafish. As comparison of 7-day and 14-day data, the cumulative content in the spleen significantly increased by 26% even in the 0.1 mg/L PFOA-treated group. Morphological observations revealed that PFOA can damage immune cells in zebrafish spleen by inducing vacuolization, lipofuscin granule production, and mitochondrial swelling. The Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)/myeloid differentiation factor 88 (myd88)/NF-kappa B (P65) pathway can mediate the mRNA expression levels of interferon (IFN) and B cell-activating factor (BAFF); immunoglobulin (Ig) secretion is further regulated. RT-PCR results indicated that the expression levels of P65 and IFN in the 1 mg/L group after PFOA exposure for 7 d increased by 4.03- and 3.28-fold, respectively, in a dose-dependent manner compared with those of the control group. The linear correlation coefficient (r(2)) was analyzed, and the results indicated that the Ig-mediated pathway can be affected by PFOA. For example, the r(2) between IgD and P65 decreased from 0.641 (7 d) to 0.295 (14 d) after the cells were exposed to PFOA for a prolonged time; the r(2) between IgD and IFN increased from 0.562 (7 d) to 0.808 (14 d). The triangle plot method strongly demonstrated that increased PFOA concentration and prolonged exposure to PFOA can inhibit Ig secretion. Therefore, immune organs, particularly the spleen, of zebrafish are vulnerable to PFOA. These results can help to improve the understanding of the possible noncarcinogenic risk mechanisms induced by PFOA. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The AB(2) monomer was facilely synthesized by UV-initiated thiol-ene addition between MR and 2-mercaptoethanol in the absence of solvents. The reaction parameters were systematically optimized, and the highest yield up to 98 % was achieved with almost complete conversion of double bond within 2 h. A series of HBPEs were then obtained via bulk polymerization of the AB(2) monomer under different conditions. Among the four transesterification catalysts investigated, Ti(OBu)(4) was demonstrated to be the most efficient one due to the higher polymerization efficiency and molecular weight (M-n = 13,000 similar to 17,000 g/mol) of as-obtained HBPEs. And the degree of branching (DB) was estimated to be in the range of 0.30 similar to 0.42. Notably, the HBPEs with dangling chains exhibited a low glass transition temperature (T-g) of -42.8 similar to-59.2 degrees C, indicative of excellent low-temperature flexibility. TGA results indicated that the onset thermal degradation temperature under nitrogen exceeded 310 degrees C for all the HBPEs. In comparison to the polyrincinoleate as a linear polyester analogue, the HBPE behaved like Newtonian fluid behaviors with lower complex viscosities.

Despite encouraging advances, current strategies by introducing toughening agents and flame retardants usually show compromised mechanical strength/ductility because of the irrational interphase reaction design of multi-component polymer blends. To date it remains challenging to robust and flame-retardant PLA via controlling interphase reactions. We, herein, report the rational design of mechanically robust and flame-retardant PLA by in situ manipulating interphase reactions between PLA, epoxidized soybean oil (ESO), a biobased and inexpensive toughening agent, and ammonia polyphosphate (APP), an effective eco-friendly flame retardant. We show that in addition to a high tensile strength of 42.0 MPa, as-designed PLA/ESO/APP ternary blend exhibits a high extensibility of 165% and a fracture toughness as high as 46 MJ/m(3), which are respectively 21 and 14 folds of that of the bulk PLA. Meanwhile, a desired V-0 rating and a high limited oxygen index of 30.2% are achieved. Such outstanding performance portfolios are enabled by the rational manipulation of interphase reactions, leading to the in situ formation of favorable phase structures. This work offers an innovative methodology for facilely and massively creating high-performance multi-component polymer blends by tailoring interphase reactions, and contributes to expanding the extensive applications of PLA.

Through multivariate spectral analysis, the dynamic changes of intracellular and extracellular metabolites of anammox sludge under the declined temperature stress were characterized. It was found that effluent fluorescence components were positively related to the bacterial activity, and the response of the protein-like substances to the temperature change was more sensitive than that of humic substances. Under the transient disturbance during temperature change from 35 to 15 degrees C, anammox system tended to considerably excrete extracellular polymeric substances to resist the low temperature inhibition. However, the long-term exposure of the sludge at 10 degrees C resulted in the considerably inhibition of sludge activity, granular disintegration and heterotrophic denitrification bacteria increase. The two-dimensional correlation analysis further revealed that the humic add in extracellular polymeric substances was preferentially responded to the temperature change than protein. Anammox bacteria tended to increase the intracellular protein and electron transfer-related reactive substance excretion to counteract the low temperature inhibition. Herein, both the intra- and extracellular response characteristics of anammox sludge to temperature variation were successfully resolved via the combined spectra. This work provides a comprehensive understanding on the mechanism of anammox sludge to temperature variation and may be valuable for the development of bioreactor monitoring techniques.

Methods: The next generation sequencing (NGS) method was used to detect the whole genome sequence and HLA I allele types of tumor tissues and adjacent tissues of 5 CRC patients. pVAC-Seq was applied to identify the nascent nonapeptides generated from exon mutations. The affinity of polypeptides with respective HLA I molecules in CRC was calculated by using NETMHC 4.0 Server. The molecular localization, molecular function, and signal pathways of mutant genes in 5 CRC patients were performed by FunRich 3.1.3 software. The TIMER website was applied to predict the analysis of intratumoral immune cell infiltration associated with the gene mutations in 5 CRC patients. Results: Fifty-six tumor-specific neo-nonapeptides were predicted from 54 different exon gene mutations. The 56 tumor new nonapeptide sequences were different from the shared motif of the HLA I allele. We explored that the tumor-specific nascent nonapeptide mainly bound to HLA-A.02*03, HLA-B.58*01 and HLA-B.11*01, and the affinity analysis results suggested that 14 of the nonapeptides had strong binding force, 20 nonapeptides had weak binding force, and 22 nonapeptides had no binding force. 54 mutant exons of 5 CRC patients were chiefly located in Leading edge membrane, Fanconi anaemia nuclear complex, and Azurophil granule. The molecular functions of these genes were involved in DNA-directed DNA polymerase activity, Vitamin or cofactor transporter activity, and Receptor signaling protein tyrosine kinase activity. 54 gene mutations had key roles in Translesion synthesis by Pol zeta, Translesion synthesis by DNA polymerases bypassing lesion on DNA template, and DNA Damage Bypass. We found that the mutant FMN2 had more infiltration of CD8+ T cells in the tumor than the wild type, and the mutant ZNF717 had more infiltration of CD8+ T cells and neutrophils in the tumor than the wild type, the difference was statistically significant. Conclusion: This study provides a preliminary result to illustrate that the prediction and bioinformatics feature of tumor-specific new nine-peptide-epitopes in CRC. It is hoped that the cancer-specific neoantigen will be used for adjuvant immunotherapy after radical surgery of colorectal cancer, and the mutant genes of CRC can also be used as landmarks for postoperative recurrence and metastasis of colorectal cancer.

The synthesized hybrid porous polymers possess specific surface areas up to 1500 m(2) g(-1), pore size distributions with uniform micropores centered at 1.4 nm and mesopores centered at approximate to 4.0 nm, large pore volumes up to 1.30 cm(3) g(-1), high fluorescence intensities and good thermal stabilities. More importantly, the porosities and fluorescence emissions of these porous polymers can be tuned systematically by adjusting the geometry of node and molar ratio of reactants. They exhibit a high adsorption ability of bulky dyes (i.e., rhodamine B, Congo red, crystal violet) and heavy metal ions. For example, the equilibrium adsorption capacity for Congo red and Pb2+ achieves as high as 2230 mg g(-1) and 300 mg g(-1), respectively. These results suggest that these porous polymers may have potential applications in water purification.

This epimutant provides a unique model to investigate the (epi)genetic basis of fruit ripening. Here we report that SlSPL-CNR is a nucleus-localized protein with a distinct monopartite nuclear localization signal (NLS). It consists of four consecutive residues '30KRKR33' at the N-terminus of the protein. Mutation of the NLS abolishes SlSPL-CNR's ability to localize in the nucleus. SlSPL-CNR comprises two zinc-finger motifs (ZFMs) within the C-terminal SBP-box domain. Both ZFMs contribute to zinc-binding activity. SlSPL-CNR can induce cell death in tomato and tobacco, dependent on its nuclear localization. However, the two ZFMs have differential impacts on SlSPL-CNR's induction of severe necrosis or mild necrotic ringspot. NLS and ZFM mutants cannot complement Cnr fruits to ripen. SlSPL-CNR interacts with SlSnRK1. Virus-induced SlSnRK1 silencing leads to reduction in expression of ripening-related genes and inhibits ripening in tomato. We conclude that SlSPL-CNR is a multifunctional protein that consists of a distinct monopartite NLS, binds to zinc, and interacts with SlSnRK1 to affect cell death and tomato fruit ripening.

Such plant virus-based tools have recently attracted widespread attention for their fundamental and applied uses in flowering physiology and in accelerating breeding in dicotyledonous crops and woody fruit-trees. We now extend this technology to a monocot grass and a cereal crop. Using a Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV)-based VIF system, dubbed FoMViF, we showed that expression of florigenic Flowering Locus T (FT) genes can promote early flowering and spikelet development in proso millet, a C-4 grass species with potential as a nutritional food and biofuel resource, and in non-vernalized C-3 wheat, a major food crop worldwide. Floral and spikelet/grain induction in the two monocot plants was caused by the virally expressed untagged or FLAG-tagged FT orthologs, and the florigenic activity of rice Hd3a was more pronounced than its dicotyledonous counterparts in proso millet. The FoMViF system is easy to use and its efficacy to induce flowering and early spikelet/grain production is high. In addition to proso millet and wheat, we envisage that FoMViF will be also applicable to many economically important monocotyledonous food and biofuel crops.

The morphological characteristics of Physalis species are similar, and it is difficult to rapidly and accurately distinguish them based only on morphological characteristics. At present, the species classification and phylogeny of Physalis are still controversial. In this study, the complete chloroplast (cp) genomes of four Physalis species (Physalis angulata, P. alkekengi var. franchetii, P. minima and P. pubescens) were sequenced, and the first comprehensive cp genome analysis of Physalis was performed, which included the previously published cp genome sequence of Physalis peruviana. Results The Physalis cp genomes exhibited typical quadripartite and circular structures, and were relatively conserved in their structure and gene synteny. However, the Physalis cp genomes showed obvious variations at four regional boundaries, especially those of the inverted repeat and the large single-copy regions. The cp genomes' lengths ranged from 156,578 bp to 157,007 bp. A total of 114 different genes, 80 protein-coding genes, 30 tRNA genes, and 4 rRNA genes, were observed in four new sequenced Physalis cp genomes. Differences in repeat sequences and simple sequence repeats were detected among the Physalis cp genomes. Phylogenetic relationships among 36 species of 11 genera of Solanaceae based on their cp genomes placed Physalis in the middle and upper part of the phylogenetic tree, with a monophyletic evolution having a 100% bootstrap value. Conclusion Our results enrich the data on the cp genomes of the genus Physalis. The availability of these cp genomes will provide abundant information for further species identification, increase the taxonomic and phylogenetic resolution of Physalis, and assist in the investigation and utilization of Physalis plants.

However, due to the lack of surface dangling bonds in most 2D semiconductors, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), the direct growth of the high-kappa film on these 2D materials via an atomic layer deposition (ALD) technique often produces dielectrics with poor quality, which hinders their integration in the modern semiconductor industry. Here, we comprehensively investigate the ALD growth of the Al2O3 layer on 2D exfoliated black phosphorus (BP). Intriguingly, we found that the 2D BP with "silicon-like" characteristics possesses a native surface oxide layer PxOy after air exposure. The PxOy-induced surface dangling bonds enable the spontaneous integration of the high-quality Al2O3 layer on the BP flake without any pretreatments to functionalize the surface. Additionally, the Al2O3 layer could effectively passivate BP to prevent its degradation in ambient conditions, which addresses the most serious problem of the BP material. Moreover, the Al2O3-encapsulated BP field-effect transistor (FET) exhibits good electrical transport performance, with a high hole mobility of similar to 420 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and electron mobility of similar to 80 cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Moreover, the high-quality Al2O3 layer can also be integrated into the top-gated BP transistor and inverter. Our findings reveal the silicon-like characteristics of BP for the high-kappa ALD dielectric growth technology, which promises the seamless integration of 2D BP in the modern semiconductor industry.

Herein we reported a novel protocol for the use of highly enantioselective copper-catalyzed cycloaddition of alpha,beta-unsaturated acylsilanes as a springboard reaction for the facile synthesis of structurally diversified pyrrolidines and complicated alpha-amino esters by desilylation. The newly developed process could provide a wide range of synthetically useful acylsilane-substituted pyrrolidines (ASiP) in high yields and excellent diastereo- and enantio-selectivities with Cu/(R)-XylBINAP complex as the catalyst. And the downstream desilylation transformation enables to expand the potntial applications of 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition in the construction of structurally unique amino acid derivatives, in which an unprecedented and concerted fluoride anion-promoted C-X (X=H, Si, N, C) bond cleavage occurred to the enantioselective construction of aldehyde-substituted pyrrolidines, linear cinnamaldehyde or alkene-substituted amino esters in high ee values.

In RCC, three types of repeat units are found (in a perfectly random fashion) along the backbone, namely MMA units, unreacted GMA units and GMA units reacted with the MMA macromonomer (the latter represent the teeth of the comb). Upon blending, a percentage of PLLA is grafted onto RCC because of the reaction between its terminal carboxyl group and epoxide group in RCC. In the resultant co-continuous structures, extraction and acid hydrolysis have been employed to distinguish reacted and free (un-reacted) PLLA, in which only free PLLA and all (un-reacted and reacted) PLLA can be removed, producing extraction ratio (ER) and acid hydrolysis ratio (AR) respectively. The graft ratio (GR) of PLLA, calculated based on the difference between AR and ER, represents the reaction extent directly. The comparison of GR and torque indicates that they exhibit the same evolution with not only similar increase/equilibrium regimes but also comparable critical transition time. Therefore, our results confirm that torque spectrum can be used to describe the reaction extent as accurately as graft ratio, which is significant for the basic understanding and applications of reactive processing.

Here, we report a new type of helical trimer which can undergo transition between a hollow single helix and an intertwined double helix with no cavity by complexation and decomplexation of Cu ions. In addition, the one dimensional (1D) hollow helical tubes spontaneously generated from single helices via pi-pi interactions embedded into the lipid bilayers and displayed satisfactory channel stability and efficiency. With the addition of Cu-I ions and further extraction with ammonia, the disassembly and reassembly of 1D hollow helical tubes gave rise to the reversible switching of channel activity in situ inside the bilayers. The synthetic helical system provides the first model of reversible ligand-gated ion channel by means of dynamic transition between single and double helices, which will be available for developing intelligent artificial nanochannels for potential biological and medicinal applications.

This study explored the signaling pathways involved in anti-fibrosis role of PFD, thus laying a foundation for clinical application. Methods Pulmonary fibrosis mice models were constructed by bleomycin (BLM), and TGF-beta 1 was used to treat human fetal lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Then, PFD was added into treated mice and cells alone or in combination with beta-catenin vector. The pathological changes, inflammatory factors levels, and Collagen I levels in mice lung tissues were assessed, as well as the activity of HLFs was measured. Levels of indices related to extracellular matrix, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), Wnt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta 1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways were determined in tissues or cells. Results After treatment with BLM, the inflammatory reaction and extracellular matrix deposition in mice lung tissues were serious, which were alleviated by PFD and aggravated by the addition of beta-catenin. In HLFs, PFD reduced the activity of HLFs induced by TGF-beta 1, inhibited levels of vimentin and N-cadherin and promoted levels of E-cadherin, whereas beta-catenin produced the opposite effects to PFD. In both tissues and cells, Wnt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta 1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways were activated, which could be suppressed by PFD. Conclusions PFD alleviated pulmonary fibrosis in vitro and in vivo through regulating Wnt/GSK-3 beta/beta-catenin and TGF-beta 1/Smad2/3 signaling pathways, which might further improve the action mechanism of anti-fibrosis effect of PFD.

Here, we designed and built a heme-responsive regulatory system containing a heme biosensor HrtR and CRISPRi to regulate chemicals production while maintaining the intracellular heme homeostasis. A series of engineered biosensors with varied sensitivity and threshold were obtained by semi-rational design with site saturated mutation of HrtR. The modified metabolite-binding affinity of HrtR was confirmed by heme titration and molecular dynamic simulation. Dynamic regulation pattern of the system was validated by the fluctuation of gene expression and intracellular heme concentration. The efficiency of this regulatory system was proved by improving the 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) production to 5.35g/L, the highest yield in batch fermentation of Escherichia coli. This system was also successfully used in improving porphobilinogen (PBG) and porphyrins biosynthesis and can be applied in many other biological processes.

J	Li, CA; Wu, SS				Li, Chang-An; Wu, Shu-Shan			Topological states in generalized electric quadrupole insulators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							POLARIZATION; REALIZATION	The modern theory of electric polarization has recently been extended to higher multipole moments, such as quadrupole and octupole moments. The higher electric multipole insulators are essentially topological crystalline phases protected by underlying crystalline symmetries. Henceforth, it is natural to ask what are the consequences of symmetry breaking in these higher multipole insulators. In this work, we investigate topological phases and the consequences of symmetry breaking in generalized electric quadrupole insulators. Explicitly, we generalize the Benalcazar-Bernevig-Hughes model by adding specific terms in order to break the crystalline and nonspatial symmetries. Our results show that chiral-symmetry breaking induces an indirect gap phase which hides corner modes in bulk bands, ruining the topological quadrupole phase. We also demonstrate that quadrupole moments can remain quantized even when mirror symmetries are absent in a generalized model. Furthermore, it is shown that topological quadrupole phase is robust against a unique type of disorder presented in the system.

However, how GH3 genes function during grafting in Chinese hickory (Carya cathayensis) is largely unknown. Here, based on the transcriptome database, a comprehensive identification and expression profiling analysis of 12 GH3 genes in Chinese hickory were performed. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that CcGH3-x exists in a specific subfamily. To understand the roles of CcGH3 genes, tissue-specific expression and the response to different phytohormones were determined. Expression profiles of GH3 genes of Chinese hickory during grafting were analysed. The data suggested that 10 CcGH3 genes were down-regulated at an early stage of grafting, indicating that auxin homeostasis regulated by the CcGH3 family might be inhibited at initial stages. At the completion of grafting, expression levels of members of the CcGH3 family were restored to normal levels. Endogenous auxin levels were also measured, and the data showed that free auxin decreased to the lowest level at an early stage of grafting, and then increased during grafting. Auxin amino acid conjugation increased at an early stage of grafting in rootstock, and then decreased with progression of the graft union. Our results demonstrate that the reduced expression of CcGH3 family genes during grafting might contribute to the release of free auxin, making an important contribution to the recovery of auxin levels after grafting.

Historical studies have suggested an association between exposure to heavy metals, such as cadmium and lead, and hearing loss. Few studies have investigated this relationship in the general population in China. We conducted a case-control study with 1008 pairs of participants from a cross-sectional epidemiological survey conducted in Zhejiang Province. A self-designed questionnaire was adopted to collect information on demographics, chronic diseases, lifestyles and environmental noise. Pure-tone averages of hearing thresholds at frequencies of 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 kHz were computed. Blood lead and cadmium levels were analyzed with an atomic absorption spectrometer. After adjusting for all other potential confounding factors, compared with the lowest blood cadmium quartile (0.00-0.53 mu g/L), blood cadmium quartile 2 (0.54-0.92 mu g/L), quartile 3 (0.93-1.62 mu g/L) and quartile 4 (1.63-57.81 mu g/L) exhibited significantly elevated risks for hearing loss, with odds ratios of 1.932 (95% CI: 1.356-2.751), 2.036 (95% CI: 1.423-2.914) and 1.495 (95% CI: 1.048-2.133), respectively (P-trend<0.001). However, an association of lead with hearing loss was not found. Young age (less than 60 years), male sex and current smoking were associated with increased blood cadmium concentration. Additionally, a positive association between blood cadmium and lead concentrations was found. Therefore, we conclude that exposure to environmental cadmium may be a risk factor for hearing loss among the general population in China.

After annealed at 200 degrees C and 240 degrees C, homogeneous and phase-separated structures can be obtained respectively, which was followed by isothermal crystallization at 141 degrees C. In the case of 200 degrees C, PBSU tends to enrich in inner-spherulitic regions because of the excellent miscibility of the blend and the higher growth rate of PVDF crystals. When the specimen was annealed at 240 degrees C, phase separation produces PVDF and PBSU domains. Upon cooling to 141 degrees C, one part of PBSU is miscible with , while the other part of it remains as phase-separated domains due to the high viscosity and slow relaxation of them. The former accounts for the distribution of PBSU in inner-spherulitic regions. In the latter, however, phase-separated structures depress the diffusion of PVDF during its crystallization, leading to the lower magnitude of growth rate of spherulites. Both of them contribute to the localization of PBSU in inter-spherulitic regions. The distribution of PBSU among PVDF spherulites has been validated by long periods, pore size, and mechanical performance of the porous PVDF membranes.

This study shows a route to improve both the sustainability and economic viability of biomass pyrolysis by using pyrolytic gases and waste heat to fabricate high-quality carbon nanomaterials. The production of renewable energy and chemicals from biomass can be performed sustainably using pyrolysis, but the production costs associated with biomass pyrolysis hinder its wider application. The use of renewable precursors and waste heat to fabricate high-quality functional carbon nanomaterials can considerably improve the sustainability and economic viability of this process. Here, we propose a method to maximize the economic benefits and the sustainability of biomass pyrolysis by utilizing waste pyrolysis gases and waste heat to prepare high-quality three-dimensional graphene foams (3DGFs). The resulting 3DGFs exhibit excellent performance in environmental and energy-storage applications. On the basis of a life-cycle assessment, the overall life-cycle impacts of the present synthetic route on human health, ecosystems and resources are less than those of the conventional chemical vapour deposition (CVD) process. Overall, incorporating the pyrolytic route for fabricating functional carbonaceous materials into the biomass pyrolysis process improves the sustainability and economic viability of the process and can support wider commercial application of biomass pyrolysis.

The excitation-inhibition imbalance in the amygdala is thought to be an underlying pathological mechanism; however, the cellular and molecular control of amygdala excitation-inhibition balance is largely unknown. METHODS: By using mice expressing chemogenetic activator or inhibitor channel in amygdala parvalbumin (PV) neurons, Erbin mutant mice, and mice with Erbin specifically knocked down in amygdala PV neurons, we systematically investigated the role of amygdala PV neurons and Erbin expressed therein in the pathogenesis of anxiety disorders using the combined approaches of immunohistochemistry, electrophysiology, and behavior. RESULTS: In naive mice, chemogenetic inhibition of PV neurons produced anxiogenic effects, suggesting an essential role in the regulation of anxiety. In stressed mice with anxiety, excitatory postsynaptic responses on amygdala PV neurons were selectively diminished, accompanied by a decreased expression of Erbin specifically in amygdala PV neurons. Remarkably, both Erbin mutant mice and amygdala PV-specific Erbin knockdown mice exhibited impaired excitatory postsynaptic responses on amygdala PV neurons and increased anxiety-like behaviors. Furthermore, chemogenetic activation of amygdala PV neurons normalized anxiety behaviors in amygdala PV-specific Erbin knockdown mice and stressed mice. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results demonstrate that Erbin in PV neurons is critical for maintaining the excitation-inhibition balance in the amygdala and reveal a novel pathophysiological mechanism for anxiety disorders.

The long-term effects of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) and tetracycline (TC) on denitrification process were evaluated in this study, with the focus on nitrogen removal performance, microbial community and ARGs. Results showed that low-concentration SMX and TC (<0.2 mg L-1) initially caused a deterioration in nitrogen removal performance, while higher concentrations (0.4-20 mg L-1) of both antibiotics had no further inhibitory influences. The abundances of ARGs in both systems generally increased during the whole period, and most of them had significant correlations with intI1, especially efflux-pump genes. Castellaniella, which was the dominant genus under antibiotic pressure, might be potential resistant bacteria. These findings provide an insight into the toxic effects of different antibiotics on denitrification process, and guides future efforts to control antibiotics pollution in ecosystems.

The model takes into account wear of the contact surface of the body caused by the friction. Some preliminary error analysis for a fully discrete approximation of the contact problem was provided in Jureczka and Ochal (2019).

The key to the success relies on the selective formation of comb-like polynorbornenes or polycycloubtenes, where pendants are all aligned towards similar direction. This minireview summarizes various methods (chemical methods, spectroscopic means, and nonlinear optical measurements) for determining the comb-like conformations of pendants on these rigid-rod polymers.

Several new compounds were isolated through such a one-step reaction, and their structures were elucidated using various 2D-NMR techniques. This method provides easy access to multiple oxidative beta-elemene derivatives in one single step and represents the first modifications on cyclohexyl ring of beta-elemene. It is expected to open up the opportunity for future derivatization on cyclohexyl ring of beta-elemene. The new compounds obtained above showed better anti-proliferation activities than beta-elemene itself on several cancer cell lines. Among them, compound 17 shows the best activity in antiproliferation assays of A549 and U-87MG cell lines.

Recently, the high demand for achieving selective area deposition in device fabrications drives the research of utilizing organic molecules as a passivation layer on metals in the semiconductor industry. PTCDA molecules show promising potential to be used as a passivation layer on a metal surface because of their ability to form self-assembled compact lying-down layers with the well-exposed inert conjugated molecular pi-plane. However, the thermal and chemical stabilities of monolayer PTCDA on metal surfaces have not been thoroughly studied. In this paper, we demonstrate that monolayer PTCDA on Cu(110) and Cu(111) surfaces exhibit good thermal and chemical stabilities, as revealed through the combination of in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and in situ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy measurements. We show that monolayer PTCDA on copper is stable up to 220 degrees C and decomposes to perylene at higher temperature. Monolayer PTCDA also shows good chemical stability when exposed to O-2 and water, demonstrating good potential for its future applications as passivation layers in selective area deposition.

Limited evidence is available about the supportive care needs of Chinese cancer survivors to inform future service planning. A cross-sectional survey was conducted (STROBE cross-sectional checklist used for report). Standardized questionnaires were administered to 364 cancer survivors. Using the Supportive Care Framework as conceptual framework, factors concerning individuals' cognitive appraisals of their situation and social resources were examined to explore their association with unmet supportive care needs. The most common unmet supportive care needs included concern about the cancer coming back (51.5%), the need for up-to-date information (49.3%), collaborative management with the medical team (48.8%), and financial support (48.8%). Factors associated with greater strength of unmet supportive care needs included being female, having higher personal support, and higher self-efficacy pertaining to social relationship. Having lower support from family and friends was a contributing factor associated with greater strength of unmet needs in comprehensive cancer care and relationship, as was lower self-efficacy pertaining to uncertainty management associated with greater strength of unmet needs in quality of life, and lower self-efficacy pertaining to health professional interaction associated with greater strength of unmet needs in information. Chinese cancer survivors experience a number of unmet supportive needs. Female and rural cancer survivors, and those with lower social support level and self-efficacy are susceptible to having higher levels of unmet supportive care needs. Consistent information provision and peer support system establishment are two potentially beneficial approaches to meet cancer patients' long-term supportive care needs. Females and rural cancer survivors, those with less support from family and friends, and those with lower self-efficacy in interactions with health professionals and in managing uncertainty are especially at risk for unmet supportive care needs.

Visual event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants were exposed to a sequence of artificial logographic characters containing semantic radicals carrying low, moderate, or high levels of semantic consistency. The behavioral results showed that the mean accuracy of participants' recognition of previously exposed characters was 63.1% that was significantly above chance level (50%), indicating the statistical learning of the regularities of semantic radicals. The ERP data revealed a temporal sequence of the neural process of statistical learning of orthographic-semantic connections, and different brain indexes were found to be associated with this processing, i.e., a clear N170-P200-N400 pattern. For N170, the larger negative amplitudes were evoked by the high and moderate consistency than the low consistency. For P200, the mean amplitudes elicited by the moderate and low consistency were larger than the high consistency. In contrast, a larger N400 amplitude was observed in the low than moderate and high consistency; and more negative amplitude was elicited by the moderate than high consistency. We propose that the initial potential shifts (N170 and P200) may reflect orthographic or graphic form identification, while the later component (N400) may be associated with semantic information analysis.

The participants were asked to rate the attractiveness of their own voice, a friend's voice and strangers' voices. In addition, a self-reference valence (SR-valence) task was adopted in the experiment. Significant self-enhancement effects in voice attractiveness ratings were demonstrated, regardless of whether the participants recognized their self-voice or not. However, the friend-enhancement effect was found in only those participants who successfully recognized their friend's voice. Moreover, a significant correlation was found between self-positivity bias in the SR-valence task and the self-enhancement effect (but not the friend-enhancement effect). Our findings suggest that both the familiarity effect and self-positivity bias account for the vocal self-enhancement effect, and the influence of self-positivity bias could be implicit. The present study thus provides empirical evidence to clarify the potential explanations for the self-enhancement of voice attractiveness assessment.

To broaden the methods for the recycling and environmental usage of cow manure (CM) and its vermicompost (CV), CM, CV, and their derived biochars produced by the pyrolysis of CM or Nat 350 and 700 degrees C were used as adsorbents for Pb2+ removal in this batch adsorption experiment to reveal their different Pb2+ removal efficiencies and the underlying mechanisms. The batch experiment results revealed that all adsorbents rapidly removed Pb2+ within 30 min. A pH between 2.0 and 6.0 positively affected Pb2+ removal by CM and its biochar, whereas that by CV and its biochar was only positively affected by pH between 2.0 and 3.0. CV-derived biochar was more effective in the removal of Pb2+ than the other absorbents, with the maximum adsorption capacities (Qm) fitted from the Langmuir model reaching approximately 230.0 mg.g(-1) and the desorption rate (DR) being approximately 0.00-0.02%. Material physiochemical characterization, including X-ray diffraction analysis, showed that high pH, high ash content, rich mineral content, and high mineral contents might have been the main reasons for more effective removal of Pb2+ from aqueous solutions by N-derived biochar. Fouriertransform infrared analysis indicated that surface functional groups such as -OH, C=O, -COO-, and C-O; original and newly produced carbonate; and phosphate in CV also led to more effective Pb2+ removal efficiency from aqueous solution via surface functional group binding. Thus, pyrolyzing CVs may be used to produce biochar as a cost-effective adsorbent for heavy metal remediation in soil and water in the future. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Methods The effect of beta-elemene on HCT116p53(-/-) cell activity was detected by Cell counting Kit-8. Cell proliferation was detected by monoclonal plate. The apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and western blot. The autophagy was detected by western blot, immunofluorescence and transmission electron microscope. Determine the role of Cyclin-related protein Cyclin D3 in beta-elemene reversing the resistance of HCT116p53(-/-) to 5-fluorouracil was detected by overexpression of Cyclin D3. The effect of beta-elemene on the tumorigenic ability of p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells was detected establishing HCT116p53(-/-) all line xenograft model. Results For p53 wildtype colorectal cancer cells, beta-elemene could augment the sensitivity of 5-fluorouracil, for p53-deficient colorectal cancer cells, beta-elemene significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner, and reversed the resistance of HCT116p53(-/-) to 5-fluorouracil by inducing pro-death autophagy and Cyclin D3-dependent cycle arrest. Conclusion beta-elemene enhances the sensitivity of p53 wild-type cells to 5-fluorouracil, beta-elemene can reverse the resistance of HCT116p53(-/-) to 5-fluorouracil by inducing pro-death autophagy and Cyclin D3-dependent cycle arrest in p53-deficient colorectal cancer, which will provide a new method for the treatment of p53 deletion colorectal cancer patients.

Microbiomes in the human body mainly live in the intestine, and the human gut microbiomes are complex, which composed of more than 500 to 1500 different bacteria, archaea, fungi, and viruses. Studies have shown that these microbiomes are not only involved in the digestion and absorption of food but also indispensable in regulating host health. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that microbiomes are important for pregnant women and fetuses. During pregnancy, there will be great changes in gut microbiomes. Regulating gut microbiomes is beneficial to the health of the mother and the fetus. In addition, many complications during pregnancy are related to gut microbiomes, such as gestational diabetes, obesity, preeclampsia, digestive disorders, and autoimmune diseases. Moreover, the microbiomes in mother's milk and vagina are closely related to the colonization of microbiomes in the early life of infants. In this review, we systematically review the role of maternal microbiomes in different gestational complications, and elucidate the function and mechanism of maternal microbiomes in the neural development and immune system of offspring. These will provide a clear knowledge framework or potential research direction for researchers in related fields.

A Blockchain-enabled decentralized settlement model for IoT data exchange services	WIRELESS NETWORKS			English	Article; Early Access						Blockchain; Settlement model; Consensus protocol; Decentralized IoT data exchange		IoT data exchange services are emerging to connect various and distributed IoT data sources, which facilitate data owners exchange their IoT data flexibly. Traditional IoT data exchange services rely on a centralized third-party to negotiate the settlement of trades between data consumers and providers. Such settlement model suffers from issues including single point of failure, extra settlement fee, un-transparency of settlement details, to name a few. New settlement model is imperative to overcome such limitations. Blockchain is an innovative technology that is competent in governing the decentralized network, which poses great opportunity to implement fair settlement in decentralized manner. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-enabled settlement model for decentralized IoT data exchange services. Firstly, Bitcoin-based time commitment scheme is adopted to build fair and autonomous settlement model. Furthermore, to enhance the accountability of all transactions, an optimized practical Byzantine fault tolerant consensus protocol named ReBFT, is proposed to enable all members involved in the IoT data exchange application achieve identical shared ledger recording all transactions. Finally, experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility of our proposal.

Stimulating ferroptosis in cancer cells may be a potential strategy for cancer therapy. Therefore, ferroptosis-inducing drugs are attracting more attention for cancer treatment. Here, we showed that erianin, a natural product isolated from Dendrobium chrysotoxum Lindl, exerted its anticancer activity by inducing cell death and inhibiting cell migration in lung cancer cells. Subsequently, we demonstrated for the first time that erianin induced ferroptotic cell death in lung cancer cells, which was accompanied by ROS accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and GSH depletion. The ferroptosis inhibitors Fer-1 and Lip-1 but not Z-VAD-FMK, CQ, or necrostatin-1 rescued erianin-induced cell death, indicating that ferroptosis contributed to erianin-induced cell death. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Ca2+/CaM signaling was a critical mediator of erianin-induced ferroptosis and that blockade of this signaling significantly rescued cell death induced by erianin treatment by suppressing ferroptosis. Taken together, our data suggest that the natural product erianin exerts its anticancer effects by inducing Ca2+/CaM-dependent ferroptosis and inhibiting cell migration, and erianin will hopefully serve as a prospective compound for lung cancer treatment.

BESIII Collaboration	First measurements of chi(cJ) -> Sigma(-)(Sigma)over-bar(+) (J=0,1,2) decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							CHARMONIUM; OCTET	We measured the branching fractions of the decays chi(cJ) -> Sigma(-)(Sigma) over bar (+) for the first time using the final states n (n) over bar pi(+)pi(-). The data sample exploited here is 448.1 x 10(6) psi(3686) events collected with BESIII. We find B(chi(cJ) -> Sigma(-)(Sigma) over bar (+)) = (51.3 +/- 2.4 +/- 4.1) x 10(-5), (5.7 +/- 1.4 +/- 0.6) x 10(-5), and (4.4 +/- 1.7 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5), for J = 0, 1, 2, respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second systematic.

Herein, microporous HFMs with a gradient pore size and high hydrophilic flux were used as microfluidic device substrates. The membrane pores selectively trapped macromolecules within the inner surface, while allowing free diffusion of smaller molecules, including glucose and protein. The microfluidic flow rate in HFM closely followed the Lucas-Washburn and Laplace's models, indicating that the microfluidics facilitated the upward flow of the fluid by microcapillary action without external pumping. Subsequently, for sensing of different biomolecules, a highly sensitive fluorescent or optical chromogenic reagent was immobilized in HFM by an electrostatic interaction. Pyronin G fluorescence reagent was quenched by blood glucose, and the quenching efficiency showed a good linear correlation with glucose concentration (1-22 R-2 = 0.997). Moreover, this sensing platform was then further applied for the analysis of urine protein or glucose in the visible spectrum, with a wide testing range. Compared to traditional 2D flat membrane devices, this 3D-HFM microfluidic device exhibited excellent sensing versatility and color rendering uniformity with enhanced sensitivity. Target molecules screening, conditioning, enzymatic recognition, and signal readout of biomolecules have all been implemented on this device, which has paved the way to highly sensitive assays on point-of-care testing (POCT).

We leveraged the complex network modeling blood perfusion to pursue the changes and trends of blood flow in ischemic stroke. According to conversion of the flow chart from laser Doppler perfusion images of rats into the correlation matrix, the blood perfusion networks were formed and topology characters were quantitatively analyzed. The results verified the steal phenomenon and the compensatory ability in the vessel injury in accord with clinical indexes by the basic characters and efficiency, especially the interesting local efficiency. In addition, the outcomes exhibited consistently the small-world characters in the brain of rats. This computational model strengthened the new way of blood perfusion and potential predictions for stroke's assessment, operation and prevention from the basic vascular dynamic indexes and complex networks.

The scheme is decoupled and conserve semi-discrete three invariants. To demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the used scheme, we use three invariants, L-infinity and L-2 error norms. Numerical results manifest better performance of the scheme compared with other numerical schemes.

Osteocalcin (Ocn) is the most abundant noncollagenous protein in bone and is produced by osteoblasts. It has been previously claimed that Ocn inhibits bone formation and also functions as a hormone to regulate insulin secretion in the pancreas, testosterone synthesis in the testes, and muscle mass. We generated Ocn-deficient (Ocn(-/-)) mice by deleting Bglap and Bglap2. Analysis of Ocn(-/-)mice revealed that Ocn is not involved in the regulation of bone quantity, glucose metabolism, testosterone synthesis, or muscle mass. The orientation degree of collagen fibrils and size of biological apatite (BAp) crystallites in the c-axis were normal in the Ocn(-/-)bone. However, the crystallographic orientation of the BAp c-axis, which is normally parallel to collagen fibrils, was severely disrupted, resulting in reduced bone strength. These results demonstrate that Ocn is required for bone quality and strength by adjusting the alignment of BAp crystallites parallel to collagen fibrils; but it does not function as a hormone. Author summary The strength of bone depends on both its quantity and quality. Osteocalcin (Ocn) is the most abundant non-collagenous protein in bone, but its function remains unclear. Earlier studies by other investigators have suggested that Ocn decreases the quantity of bone by decreasing bone formation; and in addition it works as a hormone to regulate glucose metabolism, testosterone synthesis, and muscle mass in distant tissues. We have generated Ocn-deficient mice and show herein that Ocn is not required for bone formation. It is, however, required for optimal bone quality and strength. Specifically, we show that in the Ocn-deficient mice collagen fibers align normally, but apatite crystallites align randomly against collagen, resulting in disorganized mineralization and reduced bone strength. Furthermore, we show that glucose metabolism, testosterone synthesis, and muscle mass are normal in the Ocn-deficient mice. We conclude that Ocn acts in bone to optimize its quality and strength, but not quantity. And, in contrast to earlier claims, it does not work as a hormone to control glucose metabolism, testosterone synthesis, and muscle mass.

While recording event-related potentials, participants (divided into high/low psychopathic [HP/LP] traits groups) competed against two fictitious opponents in a modified Taylor Aggression Paradigm. We found that the HP group compared to the LP group selected more often high-intensity punishment for the second innocent opponent after being provoked by the first opponent. Further, a more negative N2 and a smaller P3 was found in the HP group while punishing the innocents-reflecting a tendency on antisocial-aggressive behavior. Finally, both groups showed a more negative FRN for losing than winning trials when seeing the outcome of the game. Our results suggest that high psychopathic traits increase the risk of transferring provoked aggression to innocent people-offering a psychophysiological perspective for explaining and predicting aggression against the innocents in social interactions.

FDI is the main factor of the rapid development of Zhejiang's open economy, which promotes the development of the economy, but also leads to the growth in energy consumption. Based on the time series data of energy consumption, FDI inflow, and GDP in Zhejiang from 1993 to 2017, we choose the vector auto-regression (VAR) model and try to identify the relationship among energy consumption, FDI, and economic development. The results indicate that there is a long-run equilibrium relationship among them. The FDI inflow promotes energy consumption, and the energy consumption promotes FDI inflow in turn. FDI promotes economic growth indirectly through energy consumption. Therefore, improving the quality of FDI and energy efficiency has become an inevitable choice to achieve the transition of Zhejiang's economy from high speed growth to high quality growth.

Methods: This study retrospectively included 43 patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection and 33 patients with a suspected infection, in whom the disease was eventually excluded. The IgM/IgG titer of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was measured by chemiluminescence immunoassay analysis. Results: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgG-positive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant. Conclusions: Viral serological testing is an effective means of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 infection. The positive rate and titer variance of IgG are higher than those of IgM in COVID-19.

Although the proportion of intestinal microorganisms accounted for by colonizing fungi is very small, these fungi do have a significant effect on the homeostasis of the intestinal microecosystem. In this paper, the characteristics of intestinal fungi in patients with chronic liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cirrhosis are summarized, and the effects of intestinal fungi and their metabolites are analyzed and discussed. It is important to realize that not only bacteria but also intestinal fungi play important roles in liver diseases.

Here, we review current advances in our understanding of epigenetic regulation, which has great potential for improving agronomic traits and the environmental adaptability of crops. Epigenetic regulation plays vital role in the control of complex agronomic traits. Epigenetic variation could contribute to phenotypic diversity and can be used to improve the quality and productivity of crops. Maize (Zea mays L.), one of the most widely cultivated crops for human food, animal feed, and ethanol biofuel, is a model plant for genetic studies. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have made possible the study of epigenetic regulation in maize on a genome-wide scale. In this review, we discuss recent epigenetic studies in maize many achieved by Chinese research groups. These studies have explored the roles of DNA methylation, posttranslational modifications of histones, chromatin remodeling, and noncoding RNAs in the regulation of gene expression in plant development and environment response. We also provide our future prospects for manipulating epigenetic regulation to improve crops.

Although many techniques have been proposed to solve this problem in the last decade, giving promissing performance on standard datasets, we propose a novel automatic image annotation technique in this paper. Our method uses a label transfer mechanism to automatically recommend those promising tags to each image by using the category information of images. As image representation is one of the key technique in image annotation, we use sparse coding based spatial pyramid matching and deep convolutional neural networks to model image features. And metric learning technique is further used to combine these features to achieve more effective image representation in this paper. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method get similar or better results than the state-of-the-art methods on three standard image datasets.

It is proposed that the intermediate enone IV reacted with an enamine to proceed with a [3 + 3] cyclization, thereby affording 3,4-2H-pyrindin-2-ones as major products. Interestingly, the addition of LiCl promoted the formation of the enamine and accelerated the [3 + 3] cyclization. In contrast, the [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction between the intermediate vinyl enolate VIII and an imine offered 5,6-2H-pyrindin-2-ones as minor products. This protocol represents the exceptional potential of N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) catalytic reactions in accessing biologically active 3,4-2H-pyrindin-2-one derivatives in good yield with high chemoselectivities and excellent enantiomeric purities.

We conducted long-term incubation experiments to gain new insights into the interactions between metal(loid) s (Cd, Pb, As) and Z-NZVI in naturally contaminated farmland soils, as well as the alteration of indigenous bacterial communities during soil remediation. With the pH-adjusting and adsorption capacities, 30 g kg(-1) Z-NZVI amendment significantly decreased the available metal(loid) concentrations by 10.2-96.8% and transformed them into strongly-bound fractions in acidic and alkaline soils after 180 d. An innovative magnetic separation of Z-NZVI from soils followed by XRD and XPS characterizations revealed that B-type ternary complexation, heterogeneous coprecipitation, and/or concurrent redox reactions of metal(loid)s, especially the formation of Cd-3(AsO4)(2), PbFe2(AsO4)2(OH)(2), and As-0, occurred only under specific soil conditions. Sequencing of 16S rDNA using Illumina MiSeq platform indicated that temporary shifts in iron-resistant/sensitive, pH-sensitive, denitrifying, and metal-resistant bacteria after Z-NZVI addition were ultimately eliminated because soil characteristics drove the re-establishment of indigenous bacterial community. Meanwhile, Z-NZVI recovered the basic activities of bacterial DNA replication and denitrification functions in soils. These results confirm that Z-NZVI is promising for the long-term remediation of metal(loid)s contaminated farmland soil without significant ecotoxicity. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The authors hypothesize that nerve injury enhances the excitability of spinal protein kinase C gamma expressing interneurons due to disinhibition of the feed-forward inhibitory circuit, and enables A beta primary inputs to activate spinal protein kinase C gamma expressing interneurons. Methods: Prkcg-P2A-tdTomato mice were constructed using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated nuclease 9 technology, and were used to analyze the electrophysiologic properties of spinal protein kinase C gamma expressing neurons in both normal conditions and pathologic conditions induced by chronic constriction injury of the sciatic nerve. Patch-clamp whole cell recordings were used to identify the nature of the dynamic synaptic drive to protein kinase C gamma expressing neurons. Results: A beta fiber stimulation evoked a biphasic synaptic response in 42% (31 of 73) of protein kinase C gamma expressing neurons. The inhibitory components of the biphasic synaptic response were blocked by both strychnine and bicuculline in 57% (16 of 28) of neurons. Toll-like receptor 5 immunoreactive fibers made close contact with protein kinase C gamma expressing neurons. After nerve injury, the percentage of neurons double-labeled for c-fos and Prkcg-P2A-tdTomato in animals walking on a rotarod was significantly higher than that in the nerve injury animals (4.1% vs. 9.9%, 22 of 539 vs. 54 of 548,P < 0.001). A beta fiber stimulation evoked burst action potentials in 25.8% (8 of 31) of protein kinase C gamma expressing neurons in control animals, while the proportion increased to 51.1% (23 of 45) in nerve injury animals (P = 0.027). Conclusions: The Prkcg-P2A-tdTomato mice the authors constructed provide a useful tool for further analysis on how the spinal allodynia gate works. The current study indicated that nerve injury enhanced the excitability of spinal protein kinase C gamma expressing interneurons due to disinhibition of the feed-forward inhibitory circuit, and enabled A beta primary inputs to activate spinal protein kinase C gamma expressing interneurons.

Recent studies have shown that this self-referential processing bias is modulated by emotion. However, a clear understanding of how emotional valence and arousal affect self-referential processing is still lacking. With a label-shape matching task, Experiment 1 measured a self-prioritisation effect in four different mood states. The results revealed stronger self-prioritisation effects in moods with higher arousal levels and a reliable correlation between the self-prioritisation effect and the arousal level reported by the participants; however, the effect of emotional valence was not statistically reliable. Experiment 2 further showed that alerting cues, known to raise arousal level, effectively increased the self-prioritisation effect in the same label-shape matching task. Experiment 3 clarified that alerting cues do not affect reward processing in a similar label-shape matching task, suggesting that arousal may selectively modulate self-referential processing. These observations provide clear evidence that emotional arousal modulates self-referential processing.

However, the polymorphic transition has been observed only in non-superconducting HEAs mostly under high pressure. Here we report the discovery of the superconductivity and temperature-driven polymorphism in (V0.5Nb0.5)(3-x)Mo(x)Al(0.5)G(0.5) (0.2 <= x <= 1.4) HEAs, which are of a single body-centered cubic (bcc) structure for x = 0.2 and a mixture of the bcc and A15 structures for higher x values. Upon annealing, the bcc structure undergoes a polymorphic transformation to the A15 one and all HEAs exhibit bulk superconductivity. For the sample with x = 0.2, the bcc polymorph is not superconducting down to 1.8 K, whereas the A15 polymorph has a superconducting transition temperature T-c of 10.2 K and estimated zero-temperature upper critical field B-c2(0) of 20.1 T, both of which are the highest among HEA superconductors. With increasing Mo content x, both T-c and B-c2(0) of the A15-type HEAs decrease, yet the large ratio of B-c2(0)/T-c signifies a disorder-induced enhancement of the upper critical field over a wide x range. The decrease in T-c is attributed to the decrease in both the electronic specific-heat coefficient and electron-phonon coupling strength. Furthermore, the valence electron count dependence of T-c, which is different from both the binary A15 and other structurally different HEA superconductors, suggests that T-c may be increased further by reducing the number of valence electrons. Our results not only uncover HEA superconductors of a new structural type, but also provide the first example of polymorphism-dependent superconductivity in HEAs.

However, it remains unclear whether the quantification is predictive of HBVr in leukemia patients undergoing immunosuppression. Methods: and patients: Clinical and laboratory data of the leukemia patients with resolved HBV infection diagnosed between January 2013 and March 2018 were retrospectively collected. Data series of HBV seromarkers and HBV DNA levels before the patients receiving chemotherapy and/or hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and during follow-up duration were analyzed. Results: In total, 533 leukemia patients with resolved HBV infection were included. The incidences of HBVr were 5.7% (25/441) and 2.2% (2/92) in patients receiving HSCT and chemotherapy, respectively. In patients receiving HSCT, acute lymphoid leukemia had a significantly higher incidence of HBVr than acute myeloid leukemia (8.9% vs 3.9%, P < 0.05). The incidence varied almost zero to 40% due to the differences in the profiles of HBV antibodies. High anti-HBs (cut-off of 79.2 IU/L) or low anti-HBc levels (cut-off of 4.475, S/CO) at baseline were associated with a low risk of HBVr. Anti-HBe status did not affect the incidence of HBVr. However, the cut-offs were only predictive of HBVr in the patients who had negative anti-HBe. Conclusion: The baseline profiles of HBV antibodies are predictive of the risk of HBVr in leukemia patients undergoing immunosuppression. However, seronegative anti-HBe is a prerequisite for using baseline anti-HBs and anti-HBc quantification to predict HBVr risk.

Acute alcoholic liver injury model was established in mice, and they were administrated with PQQ to investigate its hepatoprotective effect. Our results shows that PQQ can significantly ameliorate acute alcoholic liver injury by decreasing the hepatic marker enzymes, including serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST), and increasing the levels of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and catalase (CAT) in the liver. And PQQ can also significantly reduce the content of hepatic triglyceride (TG) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Moreover, PQQ attenuated alcohol-induced oxidative damage by activating NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)-mediated signaling pathway, and inhibiting Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-mediated nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling pathway. Our findings have elucidated the liver protection mechanism of PQQ, which would encourage the further exploitation of PQQ as a hepatoprotective functional food.

However, its effectiveness and validity could be impeded by lack of relationship to the patients' neuronal changes in their brain. The aim of our theoretical-empirical paper is to propose a novel brain-based quantitative objective measurement of the self and how it shapes the drawing process. We discuss recent data that how the autocorrelation window (ACW) is related to the temporal continuity of self in current neuroscience and further develop a method to use ACW to measure the temporal continuity of the drawing process, probing it in two case studies. As expected, the schizophrenic subject shows lower ACW values compared to the healthy subject and reflects the well-known deficit in the temporal continuity of the self in schizophrenia. We concluded that ACW and eventually other measures of the brain's spatiotemporal structure might be able to serve as objective markers of the self in the drawing process. As our approach connects brain, self, and drawing process, it provides the theoretical basis for the future development of a brain-based assessment of the self in the drawing process and art therapy.

Chemical-induced LTP (cLTP), which facilitates biochemical analysis of molecular changes in brain slices or neuronal cultures, has been accepted as an in vitro model to explore synaptic plasticity. cLTP, by either forskolin and rolipram (F&R) or glycine, is thought to be dependent on NMDA receptor. However, subunit-specific dependence and regulation of the NMDA receptor in cLTP remain poorly understood. In the present study, we found that phosphorylation level of GluN2B at tyrosine 1472 was modulated by F&R-induced LTP but not by glycine-induced LTP in hippocampal slices. Furthermore, an increased phosphorylation level of GluA1 at serine 845 by F&R-induced LTP rather than glycine-induced LTP was dependent on the activation of GluN2B, which is supported by the results from GluN2B antagonists, small interfering peptide and CRISPR-Cas9-mediated knock out of GluN2B. Taken together, we reveal the significant role of GluN2B in F&Rinduced LTP, uncovering the role of GluN2B subunit of NMDA receptor in a specified cLTP. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to construct and validate an electronic health record-based fall risk predictive tool to identify elders at a higher risk of falls. Methods: The one-year fall prediction model was developed using the machine-learning-based algorithm, XGBoost, and tested on an independent validation cohort. The data were collected from electronic health records (EHR) of Maine from 2016 to 2018, comprising 265,225 older patients (>= 65 years of age). Results: This model attained a validated C-statistic of 0.807, where 50 % of the identified high-risk true positives were confirmed to fall during the first 94 days of next year. The model also captured in advance 58.01 % and 54.93 % of falls that happened within the first 30 and 30-60 days of next year. The identified high-risk patients of fall showed conditions of severe disease comorbidities, an enrichment of fall-increasing cardiovascular and mental medication prescriptions and increased historical clinical utilization, revealing the complexity of the underlying fall etiology. The XGBoost algorithm captured 157 impactful predictors into the final predictive model, where cognitive disorders, abnormalities of gait and balance, Parkinson's disease, fall history and osteoporosis were identified as the top-5 strongest predictors of the future fall event. Conclusions: By using the EHR data, this risk assessment tool attained an improved discriminative ability and can be immediately deployed in the health system to provide automatic early warnings to older adults with increased fall risk and identify their personalized risk factors to facilitate customized fall interventions.

However, the property change of a natural riboswitch is difficult due to the lack of the understanding of aptamer ligand binding properties and a proper screening method for both rational and irrational design. In this study, an effective method to change the threshold of riboswitch was established in vivo based on growth coupled screening by combining both positive and negative selections. The feasibility of the method was verified by the model library. Using this method, an N-acetylneuraminic acid (NeuAc) riboswitch was evolved and modified riboswitches with high threshold and large dynamic range were obtained. Then, using a new NeuAc riboswitch, both ribosome binding sites and key gene in NeuAc biosynthesis pathway were optimized. The highest NeuAc production of 14.32 g/l that has been reported using glucose as sole carbon source was obtained.

However, the characteristics and functional roles of IL-18 remain largely unknown in amphibians, which were classed as major group of vertebrates. In the present study, two IL-18 genes (AdIL-18A and AdIL-18B) and four transcripts (AdIL-18A1, AdIL-18A2, AdIL-18B1 and AdIL-18B2) were firstly identified and characterized from Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the presence of more than one gene copy or two transcripts of IL-18 in one species. The complete open reading frames of AdIL-18A1, AdIL-18A2, AdIL-18B1 and AdIL-18B2 were 588 bp, 603 bp, 591 bp and 606 bp, respectively. The putative AdIL-18 proteins possessed the typical IL-1 domains and phylogenetic analysis indicated that AdIL-18s grouped together with other vertebrate IL-18 proteins. The expression profiles of AdIL-18s were investigated under the challenges of Aeromonas hydrophila, Staphylococcus ureae and Poly (I:C) respectively, and the results suggested that AdIL-18s were involved in the immune responses against both bacterial and viral infections. Moreover, the expression levels of two NF-kappa Bs (P100 and P105) and four proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma) were inhibited in AdIL-18A1/A2-silenced cells when treated with bacteria and viral RNA analog. Additionally, the transcription levels of these immune-related cytokine genes were markedly induced when the lymphocytes were treated with recombinant AdIL-18A1 or AdIL-18A2 proteins, implying the involvement of AdIL-18s in triggering NF-kappa B signaling and proinflammatory responses. These results might provide new insights into the origin or evolution of IL-18 in amphibians and even in vertebrates.

Four arsenicals (As(III), DMA, MMA and As(V)), four mercurials (Hg(II), MeHg, EtHg and PhHg) and three lead compounds (Pb(II), TML and TEL) were simultaneously analyzed within only 8 min with acceptable resolution (2.0-8.2 for As, 1.6-6.1 for Hg and 2.7-4.0 for Pb). The detection limits were 0.036-0.20 for As-species, 0.023-0.041 for Hg-species, and 0.0076-0.14 mu g L-1 for Pb-species. The developed method was applied for the measurement of five lotus seed samples, indicating the presence of DMA (19.6-28.2 mu g kg(-1)), TML (1.4-2.9 mu g kg(-1)), MeHg (1.2-4.8 mu g kg(-1)) and EtHg (0.8-2.2 mu g kg(-1)).

Chitosan-based pH-sensitive polymers drug delivery systems could improve DOX's activity and selectivity against tumor cells. Understanding the atomic interaction mechanism between chitosan and DOX at different pH levels is important in the design and application of chitosan-based drug delivery systems. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the encapsulation and release of DOX by chitosan at different pH levels. Our results show that the protonation state of amine groups of chitosan and the p-p stacking interaction between the conjugated anthraquinone ring of DOX regulate the interaction behavior between chitosan and DOX. Moreover, DOX could gradually release from chitosan at acidic pH environment in tumor tissue. These results revealed the underlying atomic interaction mechanism between DOX and chitosan at various pH levels and may provide novel ideas for the design and application of chitosan-based drug delivery system.

This superconductor has the same crystal symmetry as the iron arsenide materials. Previous work points to it being a two-gap superconductor, with an unknown pairing mechanism. No structural transitions in the vortex lattice are seen in the phase diagram, arguing against d-wave gap symmetry. Empirical fits of the temperature dependence of the form factor and penetration depth rule out a simple s-wave model, supporting the presence of nodes in the gap function. The variation of the VL opening angle with field is consistent with earlier reports of multiple gaps.	[Jellyman, E.; Jefferies, P.; Pollard, S.; Forgan, E.

In recent years, the degradome sequencing (degradome-seq) libraries became a rich storehouse for researchers to study on RNA processing and regulation. Here, we provided a brief overview of the uses of degradome-seq data in plant RNA biology, especially on non-coding RNA processing and small RNA-guided target cleavages. Some novel applications in RNA research area, such as in vivo mapping of the endoribonucleolytic cleavage sites, identification of conserved motifs at the 5MODIFIER LETTER PRIME ends of the uncapped RNA fragments, and searching for the protein-binding regions on the transcripts, were also mentioned. More importantly, we proposed a model for the biologists to deduce the contributions of transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional regulation to gene differential expression based on degradome-seq data. Finally, we hope that the degradome-based analytical methods could be widely applied for the studies on RNA biology in eukaryotes.

To this end, we selected aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) as model enzyme, and AKR mutants were obtained by five-point insertion of p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF) which were subsequently cross-linked to form RP-CLEs from cell lysate supernatant under microwave irradiation. The AKR five-point mutant and corresponding RP-CLEs were characterized using MALDI-TOF MS, SEM, and FT-IR, respectively. The specific activities of RP-CLEs of three-point and five-point AKR were 1.27 and 2.06 U.mg(-1), 1.21- and 2.16-fold those of the corresponding free enzymes, respectively. In the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-1-(2,6-dichloro-3-fluorophenyl) ethanol, the yield was up to 90.8%, and the ee was 99.98%. Moreover, after 6 consecutive 12 h reaction cycles, AKR five-point RP-CLEs still retained 80% of their initial activity. Thus, depending on the enzyme structure analysis, different numbers of NSAAs could be reasonably incorporated into the protein to accurately guide and control the covalent linkage to form RP-CLEs. This green method could be further developed both to generate bio-orthogonally cross-linked enzyme and separate them from nontarget proteins for industrial biocatalysis.

However, in contrast with the considerable knowledge on the island biogeography of higher organisms, we know little about the distribution of microorganisms within and among islands. Here, we explored insular soil bacterial and fungal biogeography and underlying mechanisms, using soil microbiota from a group of land-bridge islands as a model system. Similar to island species-area relationships observed for many macroorganisms, both island-scale bacterial and fungal diversity increased with island area; neither diversity, however, was affected by island isolation. By contrast, bacterial and fungal communities exhibited strikingly different assembly patterns within islands. The loss of bacterial diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the systematic decline of diversity within samples, whereas the loss of fungal diversity on smaller islands was driven primarily by the homogenization of community composition among samples. Lower soil moisture limited within-sample bacterial diversity, whereas smaller spatial distances among samples restricted among-sample fungal diversity, on smaller islands. These results indicate that among-island differences in habitat quality generate the bacterial island species-area relationship, whereas within-island dispersal limitation generates the fungal island species-area relationship. Together, our study suggests that different mechanisms underlie similar island biogeography patterns of soil bacteria and fungi.

To effectively assess their emotion regulation and promote their mental health and growth, this study aimed to explore the psychometric properties of the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) in Chinese rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and young adults. A total of 397 rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and young adults (age 16.78 +/- 1.92 years old) were enrolled. Two common factors were obtained in exploratory factor analysis (EFA), which is similar to both the original English version and the Chinese version for college students. Besides, the ERQ was significantly correlated with subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and academic emotion, which indicated the criterion validity of the ERQ is good (r = 0.17 similar to 0.41, all ps < 0.01). The Cronbach's alpha of the ERQ total scores and subscales were acceptable (0.73 similar to 0.82), indicating that the ERQ had acceptable to excellent levels of internal consistency reliability. Therefore, ERQ is a valid and reliable measure to assess the emotion regulation of rural-to-urban migrant adolescents and young adults in China.

J	Jiang, WJ; Liu, RR; Jia, CX				Jiang, Wen-Jun; Liu, Run-Ran; Jia, Chun-Xiao			Depth Penetration and Scope Extension of Failures in the Cascading of Multilayer Networks	COMPLEXITY			English	Article							INTERDEPENDENT NETWORKS; PERCOLATION; ROBUSTNESS	Real-world complex systems always interact with each other, which causes these systems to collapse in an avalanche or cascading manner in the case of random failures or malicious attacks. The robustness of multilayer networks has attracted great interest, where the modeling and theoretical studies of which always rely on the concept of multilayer networks and percolation methods. A straightforward and tacit assumption is that the interdependence across network layers is strong, which means that a node will fail entirely with the removal of all links if one of its interdependent nodes in other network layers fails. However, this oversimplification cannot describe the general form of interactions across the network layers in a real-world multilayer system. In this paper, we reveal the nature of the avalanche disintegration of general multilayer networks with arbitrary interdependency strength across network layers. Specifically, we identify that the avalanche process of the whole system can essentially be decomposed into two microscopic cascading dynamics in terms of the propagation direction of the failures: depth penetration and scope extension. In the process of depth penetration, the failures propagate from layer to layer, where the greater the number of failed nodes is, the greater is the destructive power that will emerge in an interdependency group. In the process of scope extension, failures propagate with the removal of connections in each network layer. Under the synergy of the two processes, we find that the percolation transition of the system can be discontinuous or continuous with changes in the interdependency strength across network layers, which means that a sudden system-wide collapse can be avoided by controlling the interdependency strength across network layers. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanism of global collapse in multilayer infrastructure systems but also provides stimulating ideas on intervention programs and approaches for cascade failures.

We announced a knowledge-test entailing prizes in the classrooms of a primary school and a middle school. Altogether 79 Chinese children (6-18 years) voluntarily participated in the test: listening to a series of animal sounds before guessing the names of the animals. Meanwhile, behind the participants, a video was playing images that ostensibly corresponded to the sounds being played. In fact, this was not necessarily the case, i.e., some items cannot be solved because the sounds played are not from any animal but machine-synthesized. Participants were instructed not to look back at the video. However, 51 children peeked at the video for the unsolvable items, although the peeking behavior decreased with age. Moreover, when explaining how they correctly guessed the unsolvable items, children as young as 6 years old were able to apply a linguistic strategy (i.e., "capability attribution") for lying. Besides "capability attribution," Children also applied "fortune attribution" and "topic shift" for lying. Finally, "fortune attribution" and "topic shift" increased with age. Therefore, educators need to be aware that children are able to apply verbal strategies for lying that could involve truthful statements (i.e., "topic shift") or statements that are difficult to be proved as untruthful (i.e., "fortune attribution").

This study aimed to explore the role of SNHG16 in sorafenib-resistant HCC cells and its mechanism with miR-23b-3p. Methods The sorafenib-resistant Hep3B cell model was established. The SNHG16 and miR-23b-3p gene expressions were determined in normal HCC and sorafenib-resistant HCC tissues. Detection of the expression of SNHG16 and miR-23b-3p and its respective correlation with survival rate were performed. Target genes to SNHG16 and miR-23b-3p were predicted, and verified by dual-fluorescent reporter assay. The effects of SNHG16 and miR-23b-3p on SNHG16, miR-23b-3p, EGR1 expression, viability, apoptosis as well as LC3II/LC3 expression in Hep3B and Hep3B/So cells were detected by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, flow cytometry, and western blot. In in vivo studies, the NOD/SCID mice model was established to explore the effects of Hep3B and Hep3B/So cells with inhibited SNHG16 or miR-23b-3p on tumor size, EGR1 expression, and autophagy. Results High SNHG16 expression in HCC-resistant tissues and low miR-23b-3p expression in all HCC tissues were detected, and the two were negatively correlated. Low SNHG16 and high miR-23b-3p were related to a high survival rate of HCC patients. Moreover, SNHG16 overexpression promoted Hep3B/So cell viability and autophagy, suppressed apoptosis by inhibiting miR-23b-3p expression through up-regulating EGR1, however, the effect of si-SNHG16 was opposite. In in vivo studies, miR-23b-3p inhibitor suppressed the high sorafenib sensitivity in Hep3B/So cells caused by SNHG16 silencing through promoting viability, autophagy, and suppressing apoptosis. Conclusion SNHG16 promotes Hep3B/So cell viability, autophagy, and inhibits apoptosis to maintain its resistance to sorafenib through regulating the expression of miR-23b-3p via sponging EGR1.

In this study, the microscale superlubricity of fullerene derivatives was accomplished by the construction of regular host-guest assembly structures. Herein, the host-guest assembly structures of fullerene derivatives were successfully constructed on a highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) surface by introducing the macrocycles as the templates and were explicitly revealed by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Meanwhile, the nanotribological properties of the host-guest assemblies were measured using atomic force microscopy (AFM), revealing ultralow friction coefficients of 0.003-0.008, which could be attributed to the restriction on removal of fullerene molecules after introducing the templates. The interaction energies were calculated by density functional theory (DFT) method, which indicates the correlation between friction coefficients and interaction strength in the hostguest assemblies. The effort on fullerene-related superlubricity could extend the solid superlubrication systems and provide a novel pathway to explore the friction mechanisms at the molecular level.

At high temperatures (similar to 290 K), the electronic structures of both compounds resemble the open-core 4f density functional calculation results. For Ce3Pt3Bi4, clear hybridization gap can be observed below 72 K, and its coherent momentum-resolved spectral function below 18 K exhibits an topologically trivial indirect gap of similar to 6 meV and resembles density functional band structure with itinerant 4f state. For Ce3Pd3Bi4, no clear hybridization gap can be observed down to 4 K, and its momentum-resolved spectral function resembles electron-doped open-core 4f density functional calculations. The band nodal points of Ce3Pd3Bi4 at 4 K are protected by the gliding-mirror symmetry and form ringlike structure. Therefore, the Ce3Pt3Bi4 compound is topologically trivial Kondo insulator while the Ce3Pd3Bi4 compound is topological nodal-line semimetal.

Among different fabrication strategies, supramolecular self-assembly provides a versatile approach to construct hierarchical nanostructures from polyhedral cages, filaments, tubules, monolayer sheets to even cubic crystals through rationally designed supramolecular interfaces. In this mini review, we will briefly recall recent progress in reconstituting protein interfaces for hierarchical self-assembly and classify by the types of designed protein-protein interactions into receptor-ligand recognition, electrostatic interaction, metal coordination, and non-specific interaction networks. Moreover, some attempts on functionalization of protein superstructures for bioengineering and/or biomedical applications are also shortly discussed. We believe this mini review will outline the stream of hierarchical self-assembly of proteins through rationally designed supramolecular interfaces, which would open minds in visualizing protein-protein recognition and assembly in living cells and organisms, and even constructing multifarious functional bionanomaterials.

Based on the super-linear relationship between regional innovation and economic development, the new index can eliminate the influence of economic development level on innovation capabilities, and can effectively achieve the comparison of innovation capabilities among economies at different economic development levels. This new index is quite simple, and points out a series of new findings that are sharply different from the traditional cognitive phenomena, e.g. the index shows that the technological innovation capabilities of mainland China are among the highest in the world in 1980s. Moreover, the use of this new index not only can efficiently explain the economic growth of countries in the world at a higher level, but also find that there is a novel 20-year business cycle in the correlation between the index and economic growth rate. These results show that the index, as a simple single indicator, can achieve a higher degree of explanatory ability with minimal data dependence.

When the nodes in the multilayer network suffer initial failure or attack, the cascade occurs due to the interaction between the " intra-layer" and " inter-layer", and the failure can propagate in the network layer and across the layers iteratively, so that the scale of the failures is enlarged gradually. As a result, many multilayer networks are more fragile than single networks. The cascading failure of multilayer network usually brings very serious catastrophes to our society. So, conducting the research on preventing the multilayer network from cascading failure and recovering is of great significance. As far as the prevention of cascading failure is concerned, what are mainly included are the strategies such as the fault detection, the protection of important nodes, the optimization of the coupling method of networks, and the backup of nodes. As for the recovery of multi-layer network, included mainly are the strategies such as common boundary node recovery, the idle connected link recovery, the link addition, the priority recovery of important nodes, the topology perturbation, and the repairing of localized attack and adaptive link.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of the semimuonic decay D+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon(mu)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SEMILEPTONIC-B; E(+)E(-)	We report the first observation of the semimuonic decay D+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon(mu) using an e(+)e(-) collision data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb(-1) collected with the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV. The absolute branching fraction of the D+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon(mu) decay is measured to be BD+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon mu = (17.7 +/- 1.8(stat) +/- 1.1(syst)) x 10(-4). Its ratio with the world average value of the branching fraction of the D+ -> omega e(+)upsilon(mu) decay probes lepton flavor universality and it is determined to be BD+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon mu/BD+ -> omega mu(+)upsilon e(PDG) = 1.05 +/- 0.14, in agreement with the standard model expectation within one standard deviation.

Methods A total of 315 CRC patients underwent R0 surgical resection and received capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy were included. Clinical characteristics were collected from the hospital record system, prognosis was obtained by telephone follow-up. Peripheral blood and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) specimen of CRC patients were performed for the genotyping of polymorphism and mRNA expression of PD-L1, respectively. Analysis on the association between genotypes and prognosis was conducted. Results The median disease-free survival (DFS) of the 315 CRC patients was 5.1 years, the median overall survival (OS) was 6.0 years. Regarding the PD-L1 gene polymorphism analysis, the prevalence of 901T>C among the CRC patients was as follows: TT genotype 221 cases (70.16%), TC genotype 86 cases (27.30%), CC genotype 8 cases (2.54%), the minor allele frequency was 0.16, the distribution of three genotypes was in accordance with Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (P = 0.915). Moreover, the prognosis analysis indicated that the median DFS of patients with TT and TC/CC genotype was 5.4 and 4.0 years, respectively (P = 0.008). The median OS of patients with the two genotypes was 6.4 and 5.0 years (P = 0.007). The multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the TC/CC genotypes were an independent factor for DFS (odds ratio = 1.56, P = 0.018). Furthermore, the mRNA expression results indicated that the mRNA expression of PD-L1 in PBMC of the patients with TC/CC genotype was significantly higher than patients with TT genotype (P < 0.001). Conclusion The prognosis of R0 resection CRC patients received capecitabine-based adjuvant chemotherapy in real world may be influenced by PD-L1 901T>C polymorphism through mediation of the mRNA expression of PD-L1.

Here, we present ratiometric, highly responsive genetically encoded fluorescent indicators, FiNad, for monitoring NAD(+) dynamics in living cells and animals. FiNad sensors cover physiologically relevant NAD(+) concentrations and sensitively respond to increases and decreases in NAD(+). Utilizing FiNad, we performed a head-to-head comparison study of common NAD(+) precursors in various organisms and mapped their biochemical roles in enhancing NAD(+) levels. Moreover, we showed that increased NAD(+) synthesis controls morphofunctional changes of activated macrophages, and directly imaged NAD+ declines during aging in situ. The broad utility of the FiNad sensors will expand our mechanistic understanding of numerous NAD(+)-associated physiological and pathological processes and facilitate screening for drug or gene candidates that affect uptake, efflux, and metabolism of this important cofactor.

The potential mediating mechanisms linking school connectedness to deviant peer affiliation, however, have not fully examined. Thus, the present study aimed to examine the potential mediating effect of sleep problems on the association between school connectedness and deviant peer affiliation in a sample of 1010 adolescents (44% male; mean age = 14.95 +/- 1.69 years) from southern China. Adolescents self-reported measures on school connectedness, sleep problems, and deviant peer affiliation. Results showed that there was a statistically significant indirect effect of school connectedness on deviant peer affiliation through sleep problems, and such an indirect effect was consistent across gender. These results may facilitate the understanding of the potential mechanisms contributing to the development of deviant peer affiliation in adolescents.

Although ANTX-a shows widespread neurotoxicity in aquatic animals, little is known about its mechanism of action and biotransformation in biological systems, especially in immunobiological models. In this study, transmission electron microscopy results showed that ANTX-a can destroy lymphocytes of Carassius auratus in vitro by inducing cytoplasmic concentration, vacuolation, and swollen mitochondria. DNA fragmentations clearly showed a ladder pattern in agarose gel electrophoresis, which demonstrated that the apoptosis of fish lymphocytes was caused by exposure to ANTX-a. Flow cytometry results showed that the apoptotic percentage of fish lymphocytes exposed to 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 mg/L of ANTX-a for 12 h reached 18.89, 22.89, 39.23, and 35.58%, respectively. ANTX-a exposure induced a significant increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malonaldehyde (MDA) in lymphocytes. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione reductase (GR), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and the glutathione (GSH) content of the 0.01 mg/L ANTX-a-treated group decreased significantly by about 41, 46, 67, and 54% compared with that of the control group (p < 0.01), respectively. Although these observations were dose-dependent, these results suggested that ANTX-a can induce lymphocyte apoptosis via intracellular oxidative stress and destroy the antioxidant system after a short exposure time of only 12 h. Besides neurotoxicity, ANTX-a may also be toxic to the immune system of fish, even when the fish are exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations, which clearly demonstrated that the potential health risks induced by ANTX-a in aquatic organisms requires attention.

In Study 1, we categorized 53 sixth graders into a control group, a group with specific mental arithmetic difficulties, and a group with general ALD. The findings indicated the group with specific mental arithmetic difficulties performed significantly worse on the task involving phonological working memory than did the control group. However, a significant difference was not found between the group with general ALD and the control group. In Study 2 involving 54 sixth graders, we decreased the load of phonological working memory by changing the format of the problems from horizontal (more reliance on phonological codes) to vertical (more reliance on visual resources). We found that the group with specific mental arithmetic difficulties performed comparably to the control group. In other words, when the working memory load is reduced, they no longer lag significantly behind on mental arithmetic. However, the group with general ALD still performed significantly worse than the control group when the problems were presented vertically, indicating that reduced phonological working memory load did not alleviate their arithmetic difficulties. The findings in both studies suggested that poor phonological working memory might contribute to the underlying mechanism for specific mental arithmetic difficulties but not as much for general ALD.

This case-controlled study was to determine the association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding vitamin D metabolism related enzymes and childhood ASD in a Chinese Han population. Both autistic children and age-and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited from September 2012-November 2017. The severity of ASD was evaluated by the childhood autism rating scale (CARS). Taqman probe based real-time PCR was applied to examine genotypes. The association between SNPs and the risk of ASD or the disease severity was examined through the logistic regression. This study recruited 249 children with ASD and 353 healthy controls. The G/A genotype (P = 0.0112) or the G allele (P = 0.0117) of CYP24A1 rs17219315, and the G/A genotype of CYP27B1 rs4646536 (P = 0.0341) were significantly associated with an increased risk of ASD. In addition, multivariate analysis found that A allele of both CYP2R1 rs12794714 (P = 0.0159) and CYP27B1 rs4646536 (P = 0.0268) were significantly associated with the severity of ASD. Genetic polymorphisms in vitamin D metabolism related enzymes are associated with the risk of childhood ASD and the severity of the disease.

Our previous work has shown AMC training-induced activation changes in the frontal-parietal network (FPN) using task fMRI. However, whether AMC training-induced functional plasticity in the same brain network can be detected at resting state remains unknown. The current study aimed to address this question using resting state functional connectivity in a longitudinal AMC training experiment engaging a training group (18 subjects, age = 21.439 +/- 0.565) and a control group (18 subjects, age = 21.113 +/- 1.140). Our results revealed that the average functional connectivity strength within the FPN showing task activation changes was significantly enhanced after training in the AMC group, whereas it remained stable in the control group. Further analysis indicated that such connectivity increase in the AMC group was primarily driven by the enhanced coupling of bilateral superior parietal lobules (SPL). In addition, a significant and positive correlation between letter forward memory span and SPL connectivity was found at post-training session in the AMC group. While the weakest quartile of SPL connections ranking by pre-training connectivity strength showed the largest effect of enhancement after training, it was the strongest quartile of SPL connectivity that correlated the most with memory span at post-training session. These findings suggest that AMC training may enhance bilateral SPL functional connectivity, through which AMC training might exert a transfer effect to improve short-term memory capacity.

The reactor was tolerant to 15 degrees C. and 25 degrees C shocks; however, temperature shock of 55 degrees C led to severe accumulation of effluent NO2--N (>100 mg L-1), which induced substrate inhibition. Although the shock experiments achieved a maximum effluent NO2--N concentration of 205.4 mg L-1 after a hydraulic retention time-substrate concentration shock at 25 degrees C, the inhibition was still reversible. During the experiments, the content of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) increased significantly after each shock to protect the anammox bacteria, and the value decreased correspondingly at the end of the recovery phase. The specific anammox activity showed the opposite tendency compared with that of the EPS. The performance of anammox reactor under a series of short-term temperature shocks was investigated, and the results can provide new ideas for future research. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

However, robust methods that could authenticate D. officinale from its confusing species effectively are still lacking, especially for the dried samples. This study committed to discover specific peptides biomarkers for the authentication of D. officinale from the other two Dendrobium species using label-free proteomics by nanoLC LTQ Orbitrap mass spectrometry. Multivariate statistical analysis was applied to visualize the difference between the three Dendrobium species. As a result, 29 peptides among a total of 343 measurable peptides were selected to be potential biomarkers for the classification of these Dendrobium species. The validation of the representative peptide biomarkers was carried out by the synthesized peptides and 3 peptide biomarkers were found significant for the authentication of D. officinale. Further analysis showed that peptide ALGLELDLSER may also be a biomarker for the discrimination of the D. officinale originated from different geographical regions. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, multiple factors regarding desalination performance were investigated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. These factors include the interlayer spacing distance (H), the gap width (dG), offset (O), and the number of gaps and layers in a multilayer graphene membrane (MGM). It is found that salt rejection is influenced significantly by the interlayer spacing distance owing to the largest free energy between ions and graphene sheets as well as the relatively larger size of the hydration layer around the ions. The optimal desalting parameter (dG = 1 nm, H = 0.8 nm) was selected; MGM systems based on the optimized parameter exhibited excellent salt rejection for NaCl, MgCl2 and CaCl2 solutions. These results can provide some ideas for the future design of graphene-based membranes.

However, most of existing FE and PE algorithms only consider generic functions. Actually, quadratic-functions-based FE and PE can be used to further reduce the computation costs significantly. In this paper, we present a functional encryption scheme for quadratic functions from those for generic functions. In our constructions, ciphertexts are associated with a pair of vectors (x,y)is an element of DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL ZqnxDOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Zqm, private keys are associated with a quadratic function, and the decryption of ciphertexts CT(x,y) with a private key sk(F), where F is a n x m-dimensional matrix, recovers (x)TFy is an element of DOUBLE-STRUCK CAPITAL Zq. Compared with Baltico et al.'s FEs for quadratic functions (at Crypto 2017), our schemes could obtain almost the same ciphertexts size of O((n+m)logq) as their schemes (in contrast to O(n) in Baltico et al.'s schemes), and the computation for quadratic functions in our scheme does not rely on bilinear maps, while their schemes must rely on this assumption. In particular, our schemes under the standard assumptions achieve adaptive security, while Baltico et al.'s scheme only obtains selective security. Moreover, beyond the MDDH and GGM assumptions, our schemes allow for instantiations under standard assumptions such as LWE, LPN, and etc.	[Wang, Huige] Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Comp, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China; [Wang, Huige; Zhao, Yunlei] Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kefei] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 311121, Peoples R China; [Chen, Kefei] Westone Cryptol Res Ctr, Beijing 100070, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Yuan] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Sch Comp Sci & Engn, Chengdu 611731, Peoples R China	Wang, HG (reprint author), Anhui Sci & Technol Univ, Dept Comp, Bengbu 233030, Peoples R China.; Wang, HG (reprint author), Fudan Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Shanghai 200433, Peoples R China.	wanghuige@fudan.edu.cn; kfchen@hznu.edu.cn; zy_loye@126.com; ylzhao@fudan.edu.cn			National Key Research and Development Program of China [2017YFB0802000]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [2017YFB0802000, 61877011, 61472084, U1536205, NSFC61702007, NSFC61572318, U1705264]; Shanghai Innovation Action Project [16DZ1100200]; Shanghai Science and Technology Development Funds [16JC1400801]; Shandong Provincial Key Research and Development Program of China [2017CXG0701, 2018CXGC0701];  [2019M661360];  [gxbjZD27];  [KJ2018A0533];  [XWWD201801];  [ahnis20178002];  [KJ2017A519];  [16ZB0140]	The first author is supported by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFB0802000) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos.

However, it is unknown whether litter decomposability and species traits might predict water quality changes during litter submergence. Here, we conducted a greenhouse experiment to examine the effects of four submerged plant species, together with two water sources (sampled from tourism and protected areas), and oxygen injection treatments on the changes of eight water quality parameters during litter submergence. Our results showed that litter submergence significantly affected water quality changes, and the observed effects changed through time and differed between two water sources, between oxygen injection and the control treatments, and among different litter species. Moreover, water electric conductivity (EC), total dissolved solids (TDS), water total nitrogen (TN), ammonium and nitrite nitrogen increased with increasing initial litter total carbon (TC), TN and total phosphorus (TP), but water dissolved oxygen (DO) decreased with increasing litter TC, TN and TP. Moreover, water EC, TDS and TN increased with the final mass losses after 10-week submergence. These results indicated that species traits (including decomposability) might be good predictors for the water quality changes during litter submergence, and such a trait-based approach might be a promising tool to link plant species diversity via plant functional traits to water quality or other wetland ecosystem services.

The D. officinale was directly determined by this on-line stacking method after simple extraction and dilution. The optimized background solution (BGS) was 50 mM phosphoric acid (PA) containing 100 mM SDS and 30% (v/v) methanol. The best separation and concentration performance of analytes dissolved in 90 mM CD and 100 mM PA was achieved in a short analysis time when injected at 50 mbar for 100 s. Compared with conventional sweeping-MEKC and MEKC method, significant improvement in enrichment efficiency was achieved by using this proposed method. A series of validation studies of the present method was performed under the optimal conditions. Good linearities were obtained with the correlation coefficients in the range of 0.994-0.999, the detection limits were ranged from 13 to 40 ng/mL. Sensitivity enhancement factors (SEFs) were in the range of 28.5-46.8 compared with traditional injection (injection time 3 s). Therefore, the proposed method was successfully applied for the separation and concentration of neutral analytes in real samples. (C) 2020 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Because of lignin's unique aromatic structure and high charring capability, recent years have witnessed the great flame-retardancy potential of pristine lignin and its derivatives in a wide range of polymeric materials. Unfortunately, to date there has been no critical review on the preparation, modification and application of lignin-derived flame retardants for polymeric materials. This review focuses on the flame-retardancy effects of pristine lignin and lignin chemically modified by introducing the elements phosphorus and/or nitrogen, as well as their synergistic effects with existing flame-retardant additives. This review also comprehensively compares the flame-retardancy performances of different lignin-derived flame retardants in various polymeric matrices, such as polylactic acid, polypropylene and polyamide 11. Following the conclusions, future perspectives are also presented along with new opportunities for the development of more efficient and effective lignin-based flame retardants for polymeric materials.

Wnt signaling is thought to control the balance of NSC proliferation and differentiation via the transcriptional coactivator beta-catenin during brain development and adult tissue homeostasis. Disruption of Wnt signaling may result in developmental defects and neurological diseases. Here, we summarize recent findings of the roles of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling components in NSC homeostasis for the regulation of functional brain circuits. We also suggest that the potential role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling might lead to new therapeutic strategies for neurological diseases, including, but not limited to, spinal cord injury, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and depression.

Characteristics of vulnerable groups and failure links	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Medical insurance; Poverty alleviation; Healthy poverty; Catastrophic health expenditure; Impoverishment by medical expenses	CATASTROPHIC HEALTH EXPENDITURE; POLICY; CARE	Background We examined the physiological, household, and spatial agglomeration characteristics of the health poverty population in China. We identified weak links that affect the implementation of the medical insurance and further improve its effectiveness for health poverty alleviation. Methods A national representative sample from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) was analyzed. The WHO recommended method was adopted to calculate catastrophic health expenditure (CHE) and impoverishment by medical expenses (IME). We created a binary indicator for IME as the outcome variable and applied the treatment-effect model to analyze the determinants of IME. Results The incidence of IME was 7.2% of the overall population, compared to 20.3% of the sample households trapped in CHE. The incidence of IME enrolled in insurance schemes was 7.4% higher than that of uninsured families (4.8%). Economic level, living area, family size, age of household head, having hospitalized members, and participating in insurance were statistically significant for the occurrence of IME. Conclusions The original poverty-promoting policies has not reached the maximum point of convergence with China's current demand for health. The overlapped health vulnerabilities exacerbated the risk of poverty among the elderly and households with high health needs and utilization. In addition, the medical insurance schemes have proven to be insufficient for protection against economic burden of poor households. So, special health needs, age, and household capacity to pay should be comprehensively considered while strengthening the connection between the disease insurance scheme with supplementary insurance.

The current study tested school engagement as a mediator between peer victimization and PIGU, and grit as a moderator of this mediated pathway. Chinese adolescents (N = 2116) 43.8% girls, 10-14 years old) completed self-report measures in their classrooms. SEM was used to test a moderated mediation model, with gender, age and socioeconomic status as covariates. Results showed that school engagement mediated the association between peer victimization and PIGU, and grit buffered the negative effects of both victimization and school disengagement on PIGU. The present study contributes to a better understanding of how and when peer victimization increases the risk of PIGU.

Using first-principles calculations, we systemically study the electronic structure of noncentrosymmetric superconductors A(2)Cr(3)As(3) (A = Na, K, Rb, and Cs). Topologically protected triply degenerate points connected by one-dimensional arcs appear along the C-3 axis, coexisting with strong ferromagnetic (FM) fluctuations in the non-superconducting state. Within random phase approximation, our calculations show that strong enhancements of spin fluctuations are present in K2Cr3As3 and Rb2Cr3As3 and are substantially reduced in Na2Cr3As3 and Cs2Cr3As3. Symmetry analysis of pairing gap Delta(k) and spin-orbit coupling g(k) suggest that the arc surface states may also exist in the superconducting state, giving rise to possible nontrivial topological properties.

J	Song, Y; Song, XD; Shao, GF; Hu, TG				Song, Yu; Song, Xiaodong; Shao, Guofan; Hu, Tangao			Effects of Land Use on Stream Water Quality in the Rapidly Urbanized Areas: A Multiscale Analysis	WATER			English	Article						stream water pollution; land use pattern; scale effect; redundancy analysis; urbanization	MULTIPLE SPATIAL SCALES; DONGJIANG RIVER-BASIN; LOW-ORDER STREAMS; USE PATTERNS; LANDSCAPE PATTERN; IMPACTS; COVER; MANAGEMENT; RUNOFF; COMMUNITIES	The land use and land cover changes in rapidly urbanized regions is one of the main causes of water quality deterioration. However, due to the heterogeneity of urban land use patterns and spatial scale effects, a clear understanding of the relationships between land use and water quality remains elusive. The primary purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of land use on water quality across multi scales in a rapidly urbanized region in Hangzhou City, China. The results showed that the response characteristics of stream water quality to land use were spatial scale-dependent. The total nitrogen (TN) was more closely related with land use at the circular buffer scale, whilst stronger correlations could be found between land use and algae biomass at the riparian buffer scales. Under the circular buffer scale, the forest and urban greenspace were more influential to the TN at small buffer scales, whilst significant positive or negative correlations could be found between the TN and the areas of industrial land or the wetland and river as the buffer scales increased. The redundancy analysis (RDA) showed that more than 40% variations in water quality could be explained by the landscape metrics at all circular and riparian buffer scales, and this suggests that land use pattern was an important factor influencing water quality. The variation in water quality explained by landscape metrics increased with the increase of buffer size, and this implies that land use pattern could have a closer correlation with water quality at larger spatial scales.

Compared to the original Nd-Fe-B magnet, the coercivity H-cj can get 36.7 % increments for the Ce-Al-Cu diffused magnet. Meanwhile, the microstructure of the diffused magnet has been refined with the grain size of 10 similar to 20 mu m and the corrosion potential E-corr is increased to -0.68 V. Further investigation of mass loss of magnets in hot/humid atmosphere demonstrates that the addition of low melting point alloys can improve the corrosion resistance of NdFeB sintered magnets.

The purpose of our research was to improve the widely adopted HDI index by incorporating more comprehensive sustainability perspectives, so as to help policy makers to better analyze the sustainability-related issues facing their countries. After clarifying the concept of sustainable development, our research suggests that this term represents a coordination and configuration of economic, social, and environmental aspects of development, with its major focuses on balancing intra-generational welfare and maximizing the total welfare across generations. We then put forward a novel NSDI framework including 12 indicators from dimensions of economy, resource environment, and society, and calculated the weights of 12 indicators using the entropy method. To further validate our proposed index, this paper also measured the NSDIs of 163 countries in the world, and compared this index with the HDI and other well-known modification indices of HDI. The results showed that the NSDI is a reliable and relative complete index for sustainable development assessment, which makes up for the shortcomings of existing indices.

More and more enterprises construct their edge computing platforms to store multimedia contents (i.e., video, audio, photos, and text data) for the user equipment (UE). However, both the eNB and UEs will experience serious security attacks when transmitting or receiving multimedia data via the wireless network. Existing MEC studies mainly focus on task offloading and performance improvement without considering the enterprise multimedia security problem. This paper proposes a security and performance-aware resource allocation (Spara) algorithm for enterprise multimedia in MEC environment. More specifically, we first build the architecture of enterprise multimedia security for sending the data requests to UEs, which mainly consists of computing and bandwidth resource allocation. Then, we formulate the stochastic data transmission problem to minimize the delay and energy consumption of UEs subject to the security guarantee. To achieve this goal, two queues, namely front-end queue and back-end queue, are used for each UE, and the Lyapunov optimization technique is applied to determine how to allocate the computing and bandwidth resources. Rigorous theoretical analysis shows that Spara algorithm meets the [O(1/V), O(V)] energy-delay tradeoff. Extensive simulation experiments validate this analysis result and the effectiveness of Spara algorithm.

Objectives: To investigate the effects of flupentixol-melitracen, a mixture of tricyclic antidepressant and a classical antipsychotic component, on resting-state brain function in IBS patients by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Patients and Methods: Thirty-two patients with IBS were randomly divided into an observation group (OG, n = 16) and control group (CG, n = 16). All patients in both groups were given spasmolytic agent (pinaverium bromide). For the OG group, flupentixolmelitracen was added. FMRI scans were performed in all patients before and four weeks after the therapy. The scores of gastrointestinal symptom rating scale (GSRS), Hamilton depression scale (HAMD-17) and anxiety scale (HAMA-14) were evaluated at the same time. FMRI regional homogeneity (ReHo) parameters were compared between the two groups before and after treatment using a 2 (therapy) x 2 (time) mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical method, and were correlated with the changes of GSRS, HAMD and HAMA scores in the two groups. Results: The fMRI results of the mixed-model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post analyses were as follows. When the therapeutic factor was the main effect, ReHo was increased in the left superior and middle occipital gyrus, and the left parietal gyrus, and decreased in the left thalamus and the lenticular nucleus in both groups after treatment when compared to the unmedicated state. In addition, the OG group showed decreased ReHo in the left superior temporal gyrus, the right lenticular-putamen nucleus, the right inferior frontal gyrus, the right insula, the right gyrus rectus and subcallosal gyrus. The CG group showed increased ReHo in the right angular gyrus. When the interaction between therapy and time was the main effect, the brain region with different ReHo values was in the left precuneus. In the OG group, the change of ReHo in the left precuneus was negatively correlated with the decrease of HAMD and HAMA scores. Conclusion: Flupentixol-melitracen can effectively improve anxiety, depression and gastrointestinal symptoms in patients with IBS, which may be related to the reversal of abnormal neural activity in the brain regions within the default network and the prefrontal-limbic-temporal emotional circuit in IBS patients.

Although animal NLRs form oligomers upon pathogen recognition to activate downstream signaling, the mechanisms of plant NLR activation remain largely elusive. Tm-2(2) is a plasma membrane (PM)-localized coiled coil (CC)-type NLR and confers resistance to Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) by recognizing its viral movement protein (MP). In this study, we found that Tm-2(2) self-associates upon recognition of MP. The CC domain of Tm-2(2) is the signaling domain and its function requires PM localization and self-association. The nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) domain is important for Tm-2(2) self-interaction and regulates activation of the CC domain through its nucleotide-binding and self-association. (d)ATP binding may alter the NB-ARC conformation to release its suppression of Tm-2(2) CC domain-mediated cell death. Our findings provide the first example of signaling domain for PM-localized NLR and insight into PM-localized NLR activation. Author summary Nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLR) can function as immune receptors of plants and animals and confer resistance against pathogens. However, despite their importance in immunity, the activation mechanism of PM-localized NLRs remains largely elusive. In this study, we demonstrate that CC domain is the signaling domain for inducing cell death for PM-localized NLR Tm-2(2). Further, we report that nucleotide-binding (NB-ARC) domain is important for Tm-2(2) self-association and regulates activation of CC domain through its nucleotide-binding and self-association. Our findings provide the first example of signaling domain for PM-localized NLR and insight into PM-localized NLR activation.

Typically, the individuals are scattered across different locations, and available quarantine vehicles are limited. Therefore, it is challenging to efficiently schedule the vehicles to transfer the individuals to isolated regions to control the spread of the epidemic. In this paper, we formulate such a quarantine vehicle scheduling problem for high-risk individual transfer, which is more difficult than most well-known vehicle routing problems. To efficiently solve this problem, we propose a hybrid algorithm based on the water wave optimization (WWO) metaheuristic and neighborhood search. The metaheuristic uses a small population to rapidly explore the solution space, and the neighborhood search uses a gradual strategy to improve the solution accuracy. Computational results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms several existing algorithms and obtains high-quality solutions on real-world problem instances for high-risk individual transfer in Hangzhou, China, during the peak period of the novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19).

It is confirmed that our EuSn2As2 crystal is a heavily hole doping A-type AFM metal with the Neel temperature T-N = 24 K, with a metamagnetic transition from an AFM to a ferromagnetic (FM) phase occurring at a certain critical magnetic field for the different field orientations. Meanwhile, we also find that the carrier concentration does not change with the evolution of magnetic order, indicating that the weak interaction between the localized magnetic moments from Eu2+ 4f(7) orbits and the electronic states near the Fermi level. Although the quantum anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is not observed in our crystals, it is found that a relatively large negative magnetoresistance (-13%) emerges in the AFM phase, and exhibits an exponential dependence upon magnetic field, whose microscopic origin is waiting to be clarified in future research.

J	Yin, QP				Yin Qi-Ping			THE MEANING OF COMMUNITY UNDER THE PEN OF WORDSWORTH	PHILOSOPHY AND LITERATURE			English	Article								Although Wordsworth never used the term "the structure of feeling," his views coincide with those of Raymond Williams, who invented the term: by the structure of feeling Williams means "the deep community" that makes "communication possible." What concerns Wordsworth in his imagined communities is exactly how to make this communication possible, so his ideal community is nothing short of a deep community. It should also be pointed out that Wordsworth anticipated T. S. Eliot by more than one hundred years and that their thoughts, though similar, were rendered more poetic under the pen of Wordsworth.

To address this issue, we performed a retrospective study to investigate the clinical value of NLR in these patients. Methods: All data were collected from medical records. Sixty-five cases with stage I EGFR-mutant NSCLC treated with EGFR-TKIs were enrolled. The pretreatment NLR was analyzed for associations with disease control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS). The primary outcomes of interest were DCR and PFS. All the data were analyzed using SPSS 23.0. The PFS curves were plotted by Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine the factors affecting PFS. Results: The results indicated that, compared with those with lower NLR (<2.57), the patients with a higher NLR (>= 2.57) showed a significantly shorter PFS (8.8 vs. 12.2 months, P<0.01), and decreased DCR by the end of 8, 10 months after TKIs treatment (62.5% vs. 93.3%, P=0.014; 38.5% vs. 77.8%, P=0.037). COX multivariate analysis showed that NLR was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (P<0.001). Conclusions: Elevated NLR is significantly associated with lower DCR, shorter PFS, and might act as a meaningful biomarker for predicting the efficacy of TKIs treatment and the prognosis of advanced EGFRmutant NSC I .C. High-quality prospective clinical trials with longer follow-up are needed to further confirm the results.

A retrospective study by Fox and colleagues found that a more negative resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) functional connectivity (FC) between left DLPFC and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) in a large group of healthy participants is associated with a better curative effects of rTMS in MDD, suggesting that the sgACC may be an effective region. However, a recent meta-analysis on RS-fMRI studies found that the pregenual ACC (pgACC), rather than the sgACC, of MDD patients showed increased local activity. Methods We used the stimulation coordinates in the left DLPFC analyzed by Fox et al. to perform RS-fMRI FC between the stimulation targets obtained from previous rTMS MDD studies and the potential effective regions (sgACC and pgACC, respectively) on the RS-fMRI data from 88 heathy participants. Results (a) Both the pgACC and the sgACC were negatively connected to the left DLPFC; (b) both FCs of sgACC-DLPFC and pgACC-DLPFC were more negative in responders than in nonresponders; and (c) the associations between DLPFC-sgACC functional connectivity and clinical efficacy were clustered around the midline sgACC. Conclusions Both the pgACC and the sgACC may be potential effective regions for rTMS on the left DLPFC for treatment of MDD. However, individualized ACC-DLPFC FC-based rTMS on depression should be performed in the future to test the pgACC or the sgACC as effective regions.

Here we use phylogenetic comparative methods to examine whether a link exists between body size-driven diversification and body size-frequency distributions in varanid lizards and to test the hypothesis that island lizards differ from mainland species in evolutionary processes, body size, and life-history traits (offspring number and size). We predict that: 1) since body size drives rapid diversification in groups, a link exists between body size-driven diversification and body size-frequency distributions; 2) because of various environments on island, island species will have higher speciation, extinction, and dispersal rates, compared with mainland species; 3) as a response to stronger intraspecific competition, island species will maximize individual ability associated with body size to outcompete closely-related species, and island species will produce smaller clutches of larger eggs to increase offspring quality. Our results confirm that the joint effect of differential macroevolutionary rates shapes the species richness pattern of varanid lizards. There is a link between body size-driven diversification and body size-frequency distributions, and the speciation rate is maximized at medium body sizes. Island species will have higher speciation, equal extinction, and higher dispersal rates compared with mainland species. Smaller clutch size and larger hatchling in the island than in mainland species indicate that offspring quality is more valuable than offspring quantity for island varanids.

Autophagy plays an important role in plant-pathogen interactions. Several pathogens including viruses induce autophagy in plants, but the underpinning mechanism remains largely unclear. Furthermore, in virus-plant interactions, viral factor(s) that induce autophagy have yet to be identified. Here, we report that the beta C1 protein of Cotton leaf curl Multan betasatellite (CLCuMuB) interacts with cytosolic glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC), a negative autophagic regulator, to induce autophagy in Nicotiana benthamiana. CLCuMuB beta C1 bound to GAPCs and disrupted the interaction between GAPCs and autophagy-related protein 3 (ATG3). A mutant beta C1 protein (beta C1(3A)) in which I45, Y48, and I53 were all substituted with Ala (A), had a dramatically reduced binding capacity with GAPCs, failed to disrupt the GAPCs-ATG3 interactions and failed to induce autophagy. Furthermore, mutant virus carrying beta C1(3A) showed increased symptoms and viral DNA accumulation associated with decreased autophagy in plants. These results suggest that CLCuMuB beta C1 activates autophagy by disrupting GAPCs-ATG3 interactions.

The inadequate homing of natural killer cells into the tumor site resulted in the poor efficacy of natural killer cells on solid tumors. For the adoptive transfer of tumor-directed natural killer cell has been proved effective, it is hypothesized that there must be more association between the tumor-produced chemokines and the natural killer cells-expressed chemokine receptors. Increased CXCL12 and CCL21 could ameliorated colorectal cancer via generating an anti-tumor environment by preferentially attracting natural killer cells which expressed the chemokine receptor CXCR4 and CCR7. This study demonstrated that overexpressed CXCR4 and CCR7 on the surface of NK92 cell enhanced their migration to human colon cells. Moreover, the administration of such natural killer cells resulted in tumor shrinkage and a significantly increased survival of experimental mice when compared to ones undergoing the treatment of xenografts with natural killer cells expressing only the mock control. These suggested that chemokine receptor engineered natural killer cells could be a promising tool to improve adoptive tumor immunotherapy.

However, it is still unclear about the mechanisms underlying these effects of oxytocin on neural processes, such as visual perception and awareness. Especially, it is still unclear whether oxytocin influences perceptual salience of social stimuli in the absence of awareness. Methods In a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled trial we applied an interocular suppression paradigm and eye tracking methods to investigate the influence of intranasally administered oxytocin on perceptual salience of social stimuli. Suppression times and pupillometric data were measured during subjects being presented with gradually introduced pictures of social stimuli (neutral expression faces) or nonsocial stimuli (grayscale watch pictures) that were suppressed and invisible in 10 men who were administered 24 IU oxytocin and 10 men who were administered a placebo. Results The results demonstrated that the oxytocin group perceived social stimuli more quickly accompanied by subsequent larger increasing pupil diameter than nonsocial stimuli, indicating an increased unconscious salience of social stimuli. Conclusion These findings provided new insights into oxytocin's modulatory role to social information processing, suggesting that oxytocin might enhance attentional bias to social stimuli even after removal of awareness.

Thus, optimal risk stratification is of greatest importance for reasonable choice of treatment and prognostic evaluation. For our study, a total of 1707 samples of AML patients from three public databases were divided into meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets. The meta-training set was used to build risk prediction model, and the other four data sets were employed for validation. By log-rank test and univariate COX regression analysis as well as LASSO-COX, AML patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on AML risk score (AMLRS) which was constituted by 10 survival-related genes. In meta-training, meta-testing and validation sets, the patient in the low-risk group all had a significantly longer OS (overall survival) than those in the high-risk group (P < .001), and the area under ROC curve (AUC) by time-dependent ROC was 0.5854-0.7905 for 1 year, 0.6652-0.8066 for 3 years and 0.6622-0.8034 for 5 years. Multivariate COX regression analysis indicated that AMLRS was an independent prognostic factor in four data sets.

As an epiphytic plant, Dendrobium officinale is one of precious Chinese medicines with various activities. It is well known for containing diverse endophytes, but so far not much is known about their secondary metabolites. Methods: the plant tissues were cut and cultured on agar plates to isolate and purify the endophytic bacteria from Dendrobium officinale. Taxonomical identification of strains was performed by 16s rRNA. At the same time, the crude extracts of the strains were tested for antibacterial and cytotoxic activities to screen out one endophyte, Streptomyces sp. SH-1.2-R-15 for further study. After scale-up fermentation, isolation, purification and structure elucidation by using MS, 1D/2D-NMR spectroscopic method, secondary metabolites were identified and submitted for biological activity test. Results: Fifty-eight endophytic strains representing 9 genera were obtained, with 50% of strains were Streptomyces. One of the most active strain, Streptomyces sp. 1.2- R-15, was selected for bioassay-guided isolation, which led to the discovery of two new peptide-type compounds 1 and 2, as well as a bioactive chartreusin, and four other known natural products. Their structures were determined by comprehensive spectroscopic techniques. Chartreusin showed potent cytotoxicity against Hep3B2.1-7 (IC50 =18.19 mu M) and H1299 (IC50 =19.74 mu M) cancer cell lines, and antibacterial activity against S. aureus (IC50 =23.25 mu M). Conclusions: This study highlights the endophytic bacteria from medical plant D. officinale have potential bioactivity and natural product diversity, thus implicates them as a valuable source for new anticancer and antibiotics agents.

The Fourier-transform infrared, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy measurement results demonstrated that the MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4 nanoparticles were strongly grafted onto the fabric surface via a chemically covalent bond and constructed a hierarchical micro/nanoscale structure combined with the inherent microstructure of pristine fabric. Under combination of such hierarchical structures and the inherent low surface energies of hydrophobic Si skeleton and alkyl groups, the resulting fabric exhibited superhydrophobicity and could be used to separate oil from the oil/water mixture accompanying with high separation efficiency, permeate flux, and excellent recyclability. Furthermore, the as-prepared fabric displayed excellent superhydrophobic durability against tape-peeling, abrasion, and chemicals like strong acidic and alkaline solutions, which should be ascribed to the strong interactions between the MPS-SiO2@Fe3O4 and fabric surface by strong chemical bonds. Therefore, this work not only provided a facile, environmentally friendly, and versatile strategy for fabricating the superhydrophobic composites but also opened a door to preserve the durable superhydrophobicity, exhibiting promising prospect in the application of oil/water separation.

It has been previously demonstrated to play an anti-inflammatory role in various inflammatory conditions. However, the effect of isofraxidin on myocardial infarction (MI) remains uncovered. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of isofraxidin on MI. MI mice was created and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining as well as echocardiographic evaluation were conducted to analyze the severity of MI. Oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) was used for the mimics of ischemic stress in murine cardiomyocytes, and Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), Annexin V, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release assays were conducted for cell viability. Western blot was used for the detection of NOD-like receptor family, pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3), and adapter protein apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC) in heart tissues and cardiomyocytes. Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) were applied for the detection of proinflammatory cytokines. We found that isofraxidin alleviated the severity of MI and produced a cardio-protective effect against OGD damage. Isofraxidin also decreased the overall and local inflammatory reaction in MI. Those effects were through the inhibition of the NLRP3 inflammasome. Taken together, we initially reported the cardio-protective and alleviative effect of isofraxidin on MI and uncovered its underlying mechanism related to the NLRP3 inflammasome inhibition.

With the aim of improving the efficacy of tofacitinib citrate (TOF), a liposomal system was developed for targeted delivery to inflamed joints, and this approach was validated in a RA rat model. TOF was effectively loaded into the liposomes (entrapment efficiency: 86.5 +/- 1.9%; drug loading: 2.3 +/- 0.05%) by a pH gradient method, and these molecules featured sustained drug release behaviour over 48 h. In vitro and in vivo studies showed that TOF loaded liposomes (TOFL) could be selectively taken up by inflamed cells and showed improved accumulation in arthritic paws, demonstrating the superior target ability to RA tissues. Moreover, compared to free TOF, TOFL significantly improved the therapeutic efficacy, reduced the inflammatory cytokine expression and lipid peroxidation in synovial cells in the joint tissue of RA rats. Overall, these results indicate that TOFL served as the useful nanocarriers for RA-targeted therapy.

The aim of this article is to eliminate the conceptual confusion surrounding functional polycentricity from a geographical perspective. By classifying different approaches to polycentricity, we outline the properties that characterize all forms of functional polycentricity. Accordingly, we redefine functional polycentricity and propose a corresponding framework with which to measure it. The commuting and leisure functional polycentricity of Atlanta is used as an example to illustrate the application of this framework.

However, the neuroanatomical substrates of IBS with depressive symptoms (DEP-IBS) and how depressive symptoms and brain morphology modulate IBS symptoms remain unknown. In this study, structural MRI data were processed using a voxel-based morphometry technique and one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and post-hoc t-tests were performed to compare gray matter volume (GMV) among 28 patients with DEP-IBS, 21 patients with IBS who lacked depressive symptoms (nDEP-IBS), and 36 healthy controls (HC). Correlation and mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the relationship between differing GMV in DEP-IBS and clinical variables. We found that GMV in the bilateral prefrontal, insular, and dorsal striatal areas, as well as the left temporal pole, were significantly lower in the DEP-IBS group than in the HC group. Moreover, compared with the nDEP-IBS group, the DEP-IBS group exhibited decreased GMV in the bilateral medial, dorsolateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortices, bilateral dorsal striatum, and left insular cortices. Correlation analysis revealed that GMV in these atrophic brain areas of the DEP-IBS group was negatively correlated with depression, gastrointestinal symptoms, and disease duration. Our results further revealed that depressive symptoms served as a mediator between gastrointestinal symptoms and GMV in the left insula, right medial prefrontal cortex, and right middle frontal gyrus, while gastrointestinal symptoms served as a mediator between depression and GMV in these regions. Our results suggest convergent syndromic atrophy in the pain and emotional systems of patients with DEP-IBS.

Current understanding of species distribution patterns and broad-scale species assemblages of heritage trees is limited. This study analyzed the diversity, distribution patterns, and origins of heritage trees and assessed the underlying factors contributing to their occurrence at the national scale in China. Data were drawn from published and online sources representing 561 regions across China. There were 1140 species including 105 endangered ones preserved as heritage trees. Heritage trees originated from four sources of species provenance: natural forest species 73.51 % of total species), native ruderal species (10.53 %), domesticated species (6.75 %) and exotic species (9.21 %). The origin of heritage trees differed across climatic zones. At the national and climatic zone scale, species similarity (Jaccard Index) among regions was low, constrained by geographic distance, climate (e.g., mean annual precipitation) and anthropogenic factors (e.g., population density). Mean annual precipitation, mean annual temperature, population density and GDP per capita were the main determinants of species provenance. Most heritage tree species serve tangible uses, especially domesticated and exotic species. Species assemblages of heritage trees were mainly associated with the local plant species pool, climate, socio-economic development status and human preference. As living heritage, the trees need dedicated protection measures based on their main tangible and cultural values for human, primary threats, and statutory protection degree at the species level. Regional culture, belief, and customary laws should be considered in formulating policies for protection and conservation of these trees.

J	Yan, Q; Chen, SF				Yan, Qian; Chen, Sanfeng			Hemoconcentration is a valuable predictor of prognosis in patients with acute heart failure	EXPERIMENTAL AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICINE			English	Article						acute heart failure; hemoconcentration; B-type natriuretic peptide	BRAIN NATRIURETIC PEPTIDE; CHRONIC KIDNEY-DISEASE; OUTCOMES; ANEMIA; HOSPITALIZATION; CLASSIFICATION; MORTALITY	The present study was designed to investigate the value of the hemoconcentration (HCT) in predicting the prognosis of patients with acute heart failure (AHF). A total of 188 patients with AHF were enrolled in the present retrospective study and divided into four groups based on their HCT values. The endpoint was either cardiac-associated death or re-hospitalization due to aggravated HF. The 2-year survival rates of patients in these four groups were compared. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was determined to evaluate the significance of HCT for assessing the prognosis of patients with AHF. Cox-proportional hazards regression models were performed to determine whether the HCT is an independent factor for predicting the prognosis of patients with AHF in comparison with other traditional predictors, including B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and creatinine. Of these 188 patients with AHF, 99 experienced aggravated cardiac HF resulting in death or re-hospitalization within 2 years. The AUC for HCT, as a prognostic criterion, was 0.610 (95% confidence interval: 0.528-0.691, P<0.001) with a sensitivity of 54.5% and a specificity of 65.2%. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with a higher HCT had a lower rate of death or re-hospitalization due to cardiogenic events (chi(2)=9.442, P=0.024). Cox regression analysis revealed that HCT, hemoglobin, BNP, New York Heart Association cardiac function classification and serum creatinine were independent prognostic factors in AHF. HCT may serve as a valuable predictor of prognosis in patients with AHF. Compared with that of BNP, measurement of the HCT is more convenient and economical and may be widely performed at primary hospitals.

BESIII Collaborator	Future Physics Programme of BESIII *	CHINESE PHYSICS C			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC FORM-FACTORS; ENERGY MEASUREMENT SYSTEM; LEPTON FLAVOR VIOLATION; TRIPLE-PRODUCT CORRELATIONS; CHIRAL PERTURBATION-THEORY; LARGE-MOMENTUM-TRANSFER; MU-E CONVERSION; CP VIOLATION; CROSS-SECTION; R-PARITY	There has recently been a dramatic renewal of interest in hadron spectroscopy and charm physics. This renaissance has been driven in part by the discovery of a plethora of charmonium-like XYZ states at BESIII and B factories, and the observation of an intriguing proton-antiproton threshold enhancement and the possibly related X(1835) meson state at BESIII, as well as the threshold measurements of charm mesons and charm baryons. We present a detailed survey of the important topics in tau-charm physics and hadron physics that can be further explored at BESIII during the remaining operation period of BEPCII. This survey will help in the optimization of the data-taking plan over the coming years, and provides physics motivation for the possible upgrade of BEPCII to higher luminosity.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F.

In the present study, the contribution of the NMD pathway to psoriasis lesions and its moderating effects on the biological processes of keratinocytes was reported. Sanger sequencing for skin scales from two patients with psoriasis identified two mRNA mutations (c.2935_2936insA and c.2030-2081del) in the UPF1 gene. The somatic mutants produced truncated UPF1 proteins and perturbed the NMD pathway in cells, leading to the upregulation of NMD substrates. As the most abundant epidermal growth factor receptor ligand in keratinocytes, it was concluded that amphiregulin (AREG) mRNA is a natural NMD substrate, that is dependent on its 3 ' untranslated region sequence. Perturbed NMD modulated keratinocyte homeostasis in an AREG-dependent but nonidentical manner, which highlighted the unique characteristics of NMD in keratinocytes. By targeting AREG mRNA post-transcriptionally, the UPF1-NMD pathway contributed to an imbalance between proliferation on the one hand, and apoptosis and abnormal differentiation, migration and inflammatory response on the other, in keratinocytes, which indicated a role of the NMD pathway in the full development of keratinocyte-related morbidity and skin diseases.

Participants' eye movements were tracked when they looked at four types of invented logographic characters including a semantic radical in the legal (e.g., ) and illegal positions (), a phonetic radical in the legal (e.g., ) and illegal positions (e.g., ). These logographic characters were presented simultaneously with either a sound-cued (e.g., /qiao2/) or meaning-cued (e.g., a picture of a bridge) condition. Participants appeared to allocate more visual attention towards radicals in legal, rather than illegal, positions. In addition, more eye fixations occurred on phonetic, rather than on semantic, radicals across both sound- and meaning-cued conditions, indicating participants' strong preference for phonetic over semantic radicals in visual character processing. These results underscore the universal phonology principle in processing non-alphabetic Chinese logographic characters.

Conventionaldeep learning methods need large quantities of sonar images as the sample for model training, and they cannot ensure detection speed and feature extraction ability simultaneously. For sonar dataset with small effective sample and low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNR), an improved YOLOv3 algorithm for real-time detection called as YOLOv3-DPFIN is proposed. The objective of the proposed YOLOv3-DPFIN is to accomplish the accurate detection of noise-intensive multi-category sonar targets with minimum time consumption. The proposed model conducts efficient feature extraction via the Dual-Path Network (DPN) module and the fusion transition module, and adopts a dense connection method to improve multi-scale prediction, which can complete precise object classification and location. The experimental results show that the algorithm achieves 84.4% mAP(75) with 56fps on a Nvidia Titan Xp, when testing on the sonar dataset and using the new VOC2012 mAP standard, which can meet the requirement of robust real-time detection for both raw and noised sonar targets. Moreover, the precision and speed of the proposed YOLOv3-DPFIN are superior to the original YOLOv3 model and state-of-the-art improved SSD models.

The numerous studies on UAV search methods have been reported, but few have been conducted on collaborative human-UAV search which is common in many applications. In this paper, we present a problem of collaborative human-UAV search for escaped criminals, the aim of which is to minimize the expected time of capture rather than detection. We show that our problem is much more complex than the problem of pure UAV search. The difficulty of our problem is further increased by the fact that criminals will attempt to avoid detection and capture. To solve the problem, we propose a hybrid evolutionary algorithm (EA) that uses three evolutionary operators, namely, comprehensive learning, variable mutation, and local search, to efficiently explore the solution space. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms some well-known EAs and other popular UAV search methods on test instances. An application of our method to a real-world operation took 311 min to capture a criminal who had escaped for over three days, validating its practicability and performance advantage. This paper provides a good basis for promoting the application of EAs to a wider class of man-machine collaboration scheduling problems.

Such MPTS modification not only improves thermal stability and flame resistance of GO network, but produces ultrafast flame detection and efficient fire early warning response. Typically, the MPTS-GO-10 wt% paper shows a flame detection response signal of about 1.0 s and improved fire early warning response time at a relatively temperature of 200 degrees C. The structural observation and analysis suggest that the thermal reduction behavior of GO network can be promoted by the sulfydryl groups of MPTS molecules at high temperature, thus producing the rapid and sensitive transition of electrical resistance form insulating GO into conductive reduced GO network. The MPTS functionalization developed here show promising to tailor fire early warning response of flameretardant GO based fire alarm sensor for potential fire safety and prevention applications.

J	Liu, ZF; Tong, W; Su, YQ				Liu, Zhifang; Tong, Wen; Su, Yongqiang			Interaction effects of aging, word frequency, and predictability on saccade length in Chinese reading	PEERJ			English	Article						Chinese reading; Aging; Eye movements	EYE-MOVEMENT CONTROL; OLDER-ADULTS; CONTEXTUAL CONSTRAINT; PARAFOVEAL PREVIEW; FIXATION DURATIONS; PERCEPTUAL-SPAN; AGE-DIFFERENCES; YOUNG; INFORMATION; READERS	Background. It was well known that age has an impact on word processing (word frequency or predictability) in terms of fixating time during reading. However, little is known about whether or not age modulates these impacts on saccade behaviors in Chinese reading (i.e., length of incoming/outgoing saccades for a target word). Methods. Age groups, predictability, and frequency of target words were manipulated in the present study. A larger frequency effect on lexical accessing (i.e., gaze duration) and on context integration (i.e., go-past time, total reading time), as well as larger predictability effects on data of raw total reading time, were observed in older readers when compared with their young counterparts. Results. Effect of predictability and frequency on word skipping and re-fixating rate did not differ across the two age groups. Notably, reliable interaction effects of age, along with word predictability and/or frequency, on the length of the first incoming/outgoing saccade for a target word were also observed. Discussion. Our findings suggest that the word processing function of older Chinese readers in terms of saccade targeting declines with age.

This study was designed to investigate the associations of MTHFR in Chinese populations with early-onset coronary artery disease (EOCAD). The two common variants of the MTHFR gene were genotyped in 875 EOCAD patients and 956 controls using PCR, followed by direct sequencing of the PCR product. Serum levels of Hcy were measured using an automatic biochemistry analyzer. A significant association between the MTHFR-677C/T variant and the risk of EOCAD was detected in CC versus TT (odds ratio (OR) 1.456, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.120-1.892), dominant genetic model (OR 1.266, 95% CI 1.027-1.546), and recessive genetic model (OR 1.306, 95% CI 1.040-1.639). Hcy was most abundant in TT genotype (18.31 +/- 7.22 mu mol/L), least abundant in CC genotype (11.37 +/- 5.23 mu mol/L), and detectable at intermediate levels in heterozygotes (15.25 +/- 6.58 mu mol/L). Elevated serum Hcy levels were an independent risk factor for EOCAD (ORadjust 1.431, 95% CI 1.135-1.763). Our findings indicated that the T allele of -677C/T MTHFR variant predisposes to high levels of Hcy, and that the T allele is an important risk factor for EOCAD in the Chinese population.

Acerola cherry (Malpighia emarginata D.C.) is a tropical fruit of great economic and nutritional value due to its high content of vitamin C. However, there is little information available about which ripening stage of Acerola cherry can provide the best nutrients. In the current study, the chemical variation at two developmental stages (immature and mature) were investigated by metabolic profiling, and the biological properties of Acerola cherry and its antioxidant assays at four developmental stages were measured, respectively. Through comprehensive metabolites analysis via ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry system (UPLC-QTOF), 1896 annotated metabolite features were obtained, and 133 metabolites were finally identified according to the MS/MS fragments compared with these standards in in-house database. Statistically differences in the levels of amino acids, flavonoids, lipids, terpenoids and ascorbic acids were found between mature and immature fruits. Interestingly, most of differential accumulated amino acids, flavonoids, lipids, and terpenoids predominantly accumulated in the mature fruits and ascorbic acid predominantly accumulated in the immature fruits. On the other hand, their antioxidant activities were compared. The alcoholic extract of immature acerola fruit possessed better scavenging ability of DPPH and ABTS than the mature one. The well correlations were found between the antioxidant potential with its content of ascorbic acid (r = 0.9803 and 0.9897, respectively). In conclusion, Acerola cherry showed very different metabolite profile and antioxidant activities during the fruit ripening development. The maturity of Acerola cherry has to be considered when it is being used for health food products.

Recently, numerous algorithms have been proposed to build isometric mapping. However, those methods tend to be error prone due to the topological variation and noises of the dynamic surface. To address this issue, we propose a dynamic surface correspondence method by computing maximum spatial-temporal isometric cluster. Firstly, the algorithm defines a maximum isometric cluster score to measure the correspondence quality of each cluster in the product space. Then, the maximum problem is formulated into a quadratic programming problem. Furthermore, we define a similarity function which explicitly encodes the spatial-temporal consistence of the dynamic surface. It can greatly reduce the solving dimension, and improve the correspondence accuracy. Finally, the result is extended to the dense correspondence by a geodesic distance vector. Experimental results show that our algorithm can generate consistent correspondence on three databases of surface sequences, which outperforms existing state-of-the-art algorithms.

Hypoxia-induced modulation of glucose transporter expression impacts F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET-CT imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF NUCLEAR MEDICINE AND MOLECULAR IMAGING			English	Article						Standard uptake value; Hypoxia; Glucose transporter; F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography; Hepatocellular carcinoma	POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; F-18 FDG UPTAKE; TUMORS	Purpose To investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the variable standard uptake value (SUV) of F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-computed tomography (F-18-FDG PET-CT) imaging in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and whether hypoxia-induced glucose transporter expression contributes to the progression of HCC and the rate of glycolysis in HCC cells. Materials and methods Sixteen HCC specimens obtained from patients who underwent pre-treatment staging with F-18-FDG PET-CT imaging were divided into high maximum SUV (SUVmax > 8) and low SUVmax (SUVmax < 5) groups and employed for whole-genome gene expression profiling using GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays. The relationship between SUVmax and the expression of glucose transporters 1 and 3 (GLUT1 and GLUT3) was further validated using immunohistochemical analysis. The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in different HCC cells under hypoxia and normoxia conditions were monitored by quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Glycolysis and FDG uptake by HCC cells were measured using the Seahorse XF glycolysis stress test and F-18-FDG PET-CT imaging. The effect of GLUT1 and GLUT3 on glucose uptake in HCC cells was examined using the fluorescent D-glucose analog 2-[N-(7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazol-4-yl) amino]-2-deoxy-d-glucose (2-NBDG) followed by detection of fluorescence produced by the cells using flow cytometry. Results Glucose transporters are differentially expressed between samples from HCC patients with high and low SUVmax. In particular, over-expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in high SUVmax patients was correlated with high glucose uptake and overall survival. The expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 was significantly induced by hypoxia in different HCC cells. High expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 in HCC cells were correlated with high rates of glycolysis and 18F-FDG uptake. Therefore, our data suggested that hypoxia-induced glucose transporters expression could result in the variations of F-18-FDG PET-CT imaging and progression of HCC, contributing to more aggressive disease phenotypes like large tumor size, recurrence, and poor survival. Conclusion Over-expression of GLUT1 and GLUT3 significantly increase glucose uptake in HCC cells. Hypoxia-induced glucose transporters expression may therefore be a contributing variable in F-18-FDG PET-CT imaging and progression in HCC.

Methods: This was a prospective multi-center before-after study. We compared energy related and prognostic indicators between the control group (pre-implementation stage) and intervention group (post-implementation stage). The primary endpoint was the percentage of patients receiving EN within 7 days after ICU admission. Results: 209 patients in the control group and 230 patients in the intervention group were enrolled. The implementation of the EN protocol increased the percentage of target energy reached from day 3 to day 7, and the difference between two groups reached statistical significance in day 6 (P = .01) and day 7 (P = .002). But it had no effects on proportion of patient receiving EN (P = .65) and start time of EN (P = .90). The protocol application might be associated with better hospital survival (89.1% vs 82.8%, P = .055) and reduce the incidence of EN related adverse (P = .004). There was no difference in ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU cost. Conclusion: The implementation of the enteral feeding protocol is associated with improved energy intake and a decreased incidence of enteral nutrition related adverse events for critically ill patients, but it had no statistically beneficial effects on reducing the hospital mortality rate.

Neurotoxic amyloid beta (A beta) oligomers activate neuronal glial cells, leading to the elevated generation of a large variety of inflammatory factors. Therefore, the regulation of interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R) activity is believed to be a potential target for AD therapy. However, previous evidence of the role of IL-1R in AD-related neuroinflammation is ambiguous. To reveal the exact role of IL-1R in AD and related inflammatory reactions, we generated IL-1R(-/- )AD mice. Based on the Morris water maze results, 4-month-old IL-1R(-/- ) AD mice showed better learning and memory ability than that of AD mice. However, IL-1R(-/- ) had little influence on amyloid precursor protein proteolysis, while IL-1R(-/- ) increased ADAM17 expression level. Surprisingly, ILIL-1R(-/-) even enhanced glial activation. IL-1R(-/- ) indeed attenuated inflammatory cytokine secretion, especially that of cytokins associated with Ml polarization, while it led to increased levels of some cytokins associated with M2 polarization. Finally, we found that IL-1R(-/- ) reduced the phagocytic ability of microglia. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-1R deficiency may alleviate cognitive deficits in AD mice in a manner that is partially dependent on ADAM17 regulation and microglia M2 repolarization.

The experimental data were fitted with the Antoine equation and the Clarke-Glew equation by a weighted least-squares regression method, and gave the Antoine parameters (A = 8.8461, B = 120711, C = -114.06 K, A = 8.8040, B = 1166.06, C = -97.69 K and A = 8.9712, B = 1279.86, C = -92.77 K) and standard vaporization enthalpy Delta H-g(l)m(0)(298.15 K) = 55.84 kJ mol(-1), Delta H-g(l)m(0)(298.15 K) = 47.54 kJ mol(-1) and Delta H-g(l)m(0)(298.15 K) = 49.48 kJ mol(-1) for trisF-ES, F-DiMOMS and F-TriMOS, respectively. The critical properties of trisF-ES, F-DiMOMS and F-TriMOS, including critical temperature, pressure, and volume, were estimated by the group contribution method introduced by Nannoolal et al. The acentric factors (omega) of trisF-ES, F-DiMOMS and F-TriMOS were estimated from these critical parameters and the reduced saturated vapor pressures calculated using both the Antoine equation and the Clarke-Glew equation.

The extremely low growth rate of Ca. M. parvicella and its sensitivity to environmental variations greatly limit the development of effective techniques to control filamentous bulking. Based on previous investigations, a variety of restrictive substrates, operating and culture conditions, environmental factors and other potential inhibitors have varying degrees of impact on the growth of this microorganism. This review systematically summarizes the key factors affecting Ca. M. parvicella growth with a focus on the influencing mechanism. Recent filamentous bulking control strategies are also critically reviewed and discussed. Additionally, research needs for the next few years are proposed with the aim of establishing effective and specific control strategies for filamentous sludge bulking.

Cobalt is considered as the most efficient metal in catalyzing peroxymonosulfate decomposition. Although different cobalt based nanomaterials have been developed, easy aggregation and metal ion leaching during catalytic reaction would result in its deficiency. To address the above issue, in this work, carbon supported Co/CoO core-shell nanocomposite was in-situ fabricated by using polyphenol-metal coordinate as precursor. Results indicated that cobalt nanoparticle with size of 10 nm was successfully prepared and well dispersed within the carbon matrix. By using as-prepared material as catalyst, 50 mg/L orange II was completely removed under the condition of 0.2 g/L peroxymonosulfate, 0.05 g/L catalyst, pH = 4.0-10.0. Both sulfate and hydroxyl radicals were formed during peroxymonosulfate decomposition, while sulfate radical dominated the pollutant removal. Mechanism study revealed that the cobalt was the key site for catalyzing peroxymonosulfate decomposition. This work might provide valuable information in designing and fabricating metal anchored carbon composite catalyst for efficiently and cost-effectively activate peroxymonosulfate.

However, due to the information asymmetry between investors and companies, the financing process is usually challenging and time-consuming, especially for the startups that have not yet obtained any investment. Because of this, effective data-driven techniques to automatically match startups with potentially relevant investors would be highly desirable. Here, we analyze 34,469 valid investment events collected from www.itjuzi.com and consider the cold-start problem of recommending investors for new startups. We address this problem by constructing different tripartite network representations of the data where nodes represent investors, companies, and companies' domains. First, we find that investors have strong domain preferences when investing, which motivates us to introduce virtual links between investors and investment domains in the tripartite network construction. Our analysis of the recommendation performance of diffusion-based algorithms applied to various network representations indicates that prospective investors for new startups are effectively revealed by integrating network diffusion processes with investors' domain preference.

Although variations in the nitrogen removal performance of anammox under sulfide stress have been reported previously, understanding the microorganisms at the molecular level is of greater significance. This study first deciphered the microbial community and functional gene response of anammox sludge to sulfide stress. Results showed that 20 mg L-1 sulfide could reduce specific anammox activity by 61.7%. The protein-like substances within extracellular polymeric substances were quenched at the end of the experiment. Moreover, the relative abundance of Candidatus Kuenenia significantly decreased from 28.7% to 6.4% while Thiobacillus increased from 0 to 7.2% due to sulfide stress. Furthermore, the abundances of functional genes (hzsA, hdh, nirK and nirS) significantly decreased when the sulfide concentration reached 20 mg L-1. These findings provide a further theoretical basis for the anammox process for nitrogen removal from wastewater containing sulfide.

The intrinsic coercivity (H-cj) as well as maximum energy product ((BH)(max)) were enhanced significantly by Zr substitution in the Fe69.5-xNd7B21Nb2.5Zrx (x = 0-3) alloys, while the remanence (B-r) is reduced slightly. When x = 2, annealed magnets tend to display the optimal properties of H-cj = 513.92 kA/m, B-r = 0.57 T and (BH)(max) = 37.59 kJ/m(3). The effects of the magnetic field intensity on the distribution of elements, microstructures and hard magnetic properties in Fe67.5Nd7B21Nb2.5Zr2 magnets were investigated. The results of X-ray diffractometry, transmission electron microscope and atom probe tomography indicated that the magnetic field heat treatment can not only contribute to a uniformly distributed B element enriched region but also benefit the precipitation of alpha-Fe. After heat-treatment at 563 K x 1 T, H-cj, B-r and (BH)(max) experienced an increase from 513 kA/m to 583 kA/m, 0.57 T to 0.65 T and 37.59 kJ/m(3) to 50.05 kJ/m(3), respectively. Thus, the H-cj, B-r, and (BH)(max) are enhanced by 14%, 14% and 33%, respectively.

Wavelet transform (WT) is more effective in representing the complex waveform due to its adaptivity to non-stationary or local features of data and many varieties of wavelet functions with different shapes being available. However, there is a paucity of RS-fMRI studies that systematically compare between the results of FFT versus WT. The present study employed five cohorts of datasets and compared the sensitivity and reproducibility of FFT-ALFF with those of Wavelet-ALFF based on five mother wavelets (namely, db2, bior4.4, morl, meyr, and sym3). In addition to the conventional frequency band of 0.0117-0.0781 Hz, a comparison was performed in sub-bands, namely, Slow-6 (0-0.0117 Hz), Slow-5 (0.0117-0.0273 Hz), Slow-4 (0.0273-0.0742 Hz), Slow-3 (0.0742-0.1992 Hz), and Slow-2 (0.1992-0.25 Hz). The results indicated that the Wavelet-ALFF of all five mother wavelets was generally more sensitive and reproducible than FFT-ALFF in all frequency bands. Specifically, in the higher frequency band Slow-2 (0.1992-0.25 Hz), the mean sensitivity of db2-ALFF results was 1.54 times that of FFT-ALFF, and the reproducibility of db2-ALFF results was 2.95 times that of FFT-ALFF. The findings suggest that wavelet-ALFF can replace FFT-ALFF, especially in the higher frequency band. Future studies should test more mother wavelets on other RS-fMRI metrics and multiple datasets.

J	Deng, RQ; Benckendorff, P; Gannaway, D				Deng, Ruiqi; Benckendorff, Pierre; Gannaway, Deanne			Linking learner factors, teaching context, and engagement patterns with MOOC learning outcomes	JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING			English	Article; Early Access						learner engagement; learning outcomes; massive open online courses (MOOCs); MOOC learners; student engagement; teaching environments	OPEN ONLINE COURSES; STUDENT ENGAGEMENT; SCHOOL ENGAGEMENT; HIGHER-EDUCATION; PARTICIPATION; PERFORMANCE; RATINGS; GENDER; SATISFACTION; BEHAVIOR	Prior studies of MOOC learners have focused almost exclusively on behavioural and social aspects of engagement. This paper extends the scope of previous studies by adopting a multi-dimensional, person-centred approach to investigate learner engagement in MOOCs. An analysis of 1,452 self-administered survey responses uncovered three prototypical categories of MOOC learners based on patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement: (a) "Individually Engaged" learners, (b) "Least Engaged" learners and (c) "Wholly Engaged" learners. The study revealed significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC participants with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment) and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction). The results of this study suggest that adopting a multi-dimensional, person-centred approach can be useful for researchers and practitioners to classify MOOC learners into subpopulations, design effective educational interventions that best engage different types of learners, and provide support and scaffolding to individuals with idiosyncratic or problematic engagement patterns. Lay Description What is already known about this topic Implications for practice and/or policyWhat this paper adds Most of the empirical research has adopted a unidimensional, variable-centred approach to explain engagement in MOOCs. Behavioural and social engagement are often used to measure MOOC engagement because they are overt and easily identifiable. A higher level of behavioural and social engagement predicts favourable MOOC learning outcomes, such as academic achievement and course completion. Cognitive and emotional engagement are often overlooked in MOOC research. The study employs a multi-dimensional, person-centred approach to investigate learner engagement in MOOCs. The study uncovers three prototypical categories of MOOC learners (n = 1,452) based on their patterns of behavioural, cognitive, emotional and social engagement. The study reveals significant differences among the three cohorts of MOOC learners with respect to learner factors (gender, origin, motivation), teaching context (course level, course duration, form of the assessment) and learning outcomes (course completion, perceived quality of instruction). To optimize engagement and learning outcomes, educators and learning designers should address MOOC participants' extrinsic motivations (e.g. academic and career needs) when configuring the teaching and learning space. Engagement and learning outcomes can be improved by making a course more intellectually stimulating. Educators and learning designers should avoid enticing enrolments by simply making the course easier. Engagement can be enhanced by incorporating assessment tasks and taking advantage of human-graded assessment strategies where appropriate. Reducing the duration of a MOOC is not the best way to increase engagement.

FRANCHETII	Key message We employed both metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to explore the accumulation patterns of physalins, flavonoids and chlorogenic acid in Physalis angulata and revealed the genes associated with the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds under methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Physalis angulata L. is an annual Solanaceae plant with a number of medicinally active compounds. Despite the potential pharmacological benefits of P. angulata, the scarce genomic information regarding this plant has limited the studies on the mechanisms of bioactive compound biosynthesis. To facilitate the basic understanding of the main chemical constituent biosynthesis pathways, we performed both metabolomic and transcriptomic approaches to reveal the genes associated with the biosynthesis of bioactive compounds under methyl-jasmonate (MeJA) treatment. Untargeted metabolome analysis showed that most physalins, flavonoids and chlorogenic acid were significantly upregulated. Targeted HPLC-MS/MS analysis confirmed variations in the contents of two important representative steroid derivatives (physalins B and G), total flavonoids, neochlorogenic acid, and chlorogenic acid between MeJA-treated plants and controls. Transcript levels of a few steroid biosynthesis-, flavonoid biosynthesis-, and chlorogenic acid biosynthesis-related genes were upregulated, providing a potential explanation for MeJA-induced active ingredient synthesis in P. angulata. Systematic correlation analysis identified a number of novel candidate genes associated with bioactive compound biosynthesis. These results may help to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying MeJA-induced active compound accumulation and provide several valuable candidate genes for further functional study.

However, the molecular programs controlling their development are only beginning to be understood. Here we demonstrate that Npy2r-expressing sensory neurons are in fact divided into two groups, based on transient or persistent Npy2r expression. Npy2r-transient neurons are myelinated, likely including A-fiber nociceptors, whereas Npy2r-persistent ones belong to unmyelinated pruriceptors that co-express Nppb. We then showed that the transcription factors NFIA and Runx1 are necessary for the development of Npy2r-transient A-fiber nociceptors and MrgprD(+) C-fiber nociceptors, respectively. Behaviorally, mice with conditional knockout of Nfia, but not Runx1 showed a marked attenuation of pinprick-evoked nocifensive responses. Our studies therefore identify a transcription factor controlling the development of myelinated nociceptors.

Isl1 was deleted using the Pax2-Cre system, and deletion of both alleles was verified using cochlea sections. Changes in the number of prosensory region cells were measured to determine the effect of Isl1 on the development of the mouse prosensory region. In order to test whether Isl1 formed a protein complex with Ldb1 and Gata3, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed in HEK293 cells using the Flag-tagged LIM-domain of Isl1, HA-tagged LID of Ldb1 and Myc-tagged C-terminal domain of Gata3. The expression of Gata3, Sox2, Jag1 and P27 proteins in the prosensory region were not affected in Isl1-/- prosensory cells. Thus, Isl1 did not form a protein complex with Gata3 through Ldb1 in the Isl1-/- cells. Our results suggest that Isl1 may be dispensable for the development of the mouse prosensory region.

In the reaction sequence, acetanilide was cyclized to give 2-chloroquinoline-3-carbaldehyde 1, which was transformed to 2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-3-carbaldehyde 2 by reaction with 4-phenylpiperazine in DMF-containing anhydrous K2CO3; then, compound 2 was oxidized by iodine in methanol, and methyl 2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinoline-3-carboxylate 3 was synthesized. The key intermediate 4, 4-amino-5-[2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-3-yl]-4H-1,2,4-triazole-3-thiol, was prepared using the ester 3 by a series of step. Reaction of 5 with various aromatic carboxylic acids or phenacyl bromides yielded 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazoles 5a-c and 1,2,4-triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazines 6a-c, respectively. Moreover, compound 2 condensed with o-phenylenediamine to give 2-[2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-3-yl]-1H-benzimidazole 7. Interaction of 7 and 2-chloromethyl-5-aryl-1,3,4-oxadiazoles in the presence of K2CO3 led to the title compounds 8a-c. Furthermore, 4,5-dihydroisoxazoline derivatives 9a-c were obtained by the reaction of readily accessible starting materials including 2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-3-carbaldehyde 2, 1-phenyl-2-(triphenylphosphoranylidene)ethanone and hydroximoyl chlorides under mild conditions in the presence of Et3N. The hydrazone intermediates 10a-c were obtained by the condensation of 2 with aroylhydrazides in ethanol, then, refluxing in acetic anhydride yielded 3-acetyl-5-aryl-2-[2-(4-phenylpiperazin-1-yl)quinolin-3-yl]-2,3-dihydro-1,3,4-oxadiazoles 11a-c. Structures of these compounds were established by their elemental analysis, IR, H-1 NMR, and mass spectral data.

However, it is not clear whether YAP signaling participates in the process of the formation of glia scars after spinal cord injury (SCI). In this study, we found that YAP was upregulated and activated in astrocytes of C57BL/6 male mice after SCI in a Hippo pathway-dependent manner. Conditional knockout (KO) of yap in astrocytes significantly inhibited astrocytic proliferation, impaired the formation of glial scars, inhibited the axonal regeneration, and impaired the behavioral recovery of C57BL/6 male mice after SCI. Mechanistically, the bFGF was upregulated after SCI and induced the activation of YAP through RhoA pathways, thereby promoting the formation of glial scars. Additionally, YAP promoted bFGF-induced proliferation by negatively controlling nuclear distribution of p27(Kip1) mediated by CRM I. Finally, bFGF or XMU-MP-1 (an inhibitor of Hippo kinase MST1/2 to activate YAP) injection indeed activated YAP signaling and promoted the formation of glial scars and the functional recovery of mice after SCI. These findings suggest that YAP promotes the formation of glial scars and neural regeneration of mice after SCI, and that the bFGF-RhoA-YAP-p27(Kip1)pathway positively regulates astrocytic proliferation after SCI.

However, to the best of our knowledge, the tensile strength of unreinforced silicone rubber is lower than 0.4 MPa, and the highest tensile strength of highly transparent silicone-modified materials is no more than 1.5 MPa. The poor mechanical property limits their further application in electronic devices. Here, a kind of UV-cured transparent flexible silicone materials with tensile strength as high as 2.2 MPa were prepared by a UV-initiated thiol-ene reaction of a sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane and a thiol silicone resin. Interestingly, their tensile strength can increase from 2.2 to 5.6 and 5.7 MPa after being immersed in an aqueous solution of 10 wt % hydrochloric acid and 10 wt % NaCl for 7 days, respectively. It is argued that the increase of the tensile strength of cured films may be attributed to the -SiOCH3 of the residual 3-trimethoxysilylpropanethiol in the sulfur-containing hyperbranched polycarbosilane. The performances of the cured materials were investigated in detail. These silicone materials exhibit transparency higher than 95% (wavenumber in the range of 400-800 nm), and the initial thermal decomposition temperatures of the cured materials are about 340 degrees C. These materials also show good anticorrosion property, and the mass loss of the materials immersed in the aqueous solution mediums is no more than 0.39 wt % even for 15 days.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of D+ -> eta eta pi(+) and improved measurement of D0(+) -> eta pi+ pi-((0))	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using an e(+)e(-) annihilation data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb(-1) collected at the center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the absolute branching fractions of D+ -> eta eta pi(+), D+ -> eta pi(+pi 0), and D-0 ->eta pi(+) pi(-) to be (2.96 +/- 0.24 +/- 0.10+x10(-3), (2.23 +/- 0.15 +/- 0.10)x10(-3), and (1.20 +/- 0.07 +/- 0.04) x 10(-3), respectively, where the first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones are systematic. The D+ -> eta eta pi(+) decay is observed for the first time, and the branching fractions of D+(0) -> eta pi(+) pi(0(-)) are measured with much improved precision. In addition we test for CP asymmetries in the separated charge-conjugate branching fractions; no evidence of CP violation is found.	[Ablikim, M.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, N.; Chang, J. F.; Chang, W.

In our present study, we investigated the alterations of fecal abundant microbiota with real-time quantitative PCR and the changes of indicators of gut mucosal barrier from 53 early-stage CRC patients and 45 matched healthy controls. We found that the traditional beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium decreased significantly and the carcinogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae and Fusobacterium nucleatum were significantly increased in CRC patients. We also found gut mucosal barrier dysfunction in CRC patients with increased levels of endotoxin (LPS), D-lactate, and diamine oxidase (DAO). With Pearson's correlation analysis, D-lactate, LPS, and DAO were correlated negatively with Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium and positively with Enterobacteriaceae and F. nucleatum. Our present study found dysbiosis of the fecal microbiota and dysfunction of the gut mucosal barrier in patients with early-stage CRC, which implicated that fecal abundant bacteria and gut mucosal barrier indicators could be used as targets to monitor the development and progression of CRC in a noninvasive and dynamic manner.

WGCNA was used to analyze the union of genes related to PC in NCBI and OMIM databases and the differentially expressed genes screened by TCGA-PAAD database. Samples were clustered according to gene expression in gene modules and Fisher exact method was performed. GO and KEGG were used for enrichment analysis to visually display module genes and screen driver genes. Hypergeometric test method was used to calculate pivot nodes among ncRNAs, TFs and mRNA based on RAID 2.0 and TRRUST v2 databases. The blue and yellow modules were identified as the core modules associated with PC types. MST1R, TMPRSS, MIR198, SULF1, COL1A1 and FAP were the core genes in the modules. Hypergeometric test results showed that ANCR, miR-3134, MT1DP, LOC154449, LOC28329 and other ncRNAs were key factors driving blue module genes, while LINC-ROR, UCA1, SNORD114-4, HEIH, SNORD114-6 and other ncRNAs were key factors driving yellow module genes. TFs with significant regulatory effect on blue module included LCOR, PIAS4, ZEB1, SNAI2, SMARCA4, etc. and on yellow module included HOXC6, PER2, HOXD3, TWIST2, VHL, etc. The core modules associated with PC types were proved as yellow and blue modules, and important ncRNAs and TFs regulating yellow and blue modules were found. This study provides relevant evidence for further identification of PC types.

On the basis of the somatic symptoms in generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), especially abnormal heartbeat perception, we hypothesized that abnormal activity in the insula was associated with interoceptive awareness in patients with GAD. Methods We investigated the psychological correlates of interoceptive awareness in a sample of 34 patients with first-onset, drug-naive GAD and 30 healthy controls (HCs). Furthermore, we compared blood oxygenation level-dependent responses between the two groups during a heartbeat perception task to assess task-evoked activity and its relationship with psychological measures. We also examined between-group differences in insular subregions resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC), and its relationship with anxiety severity. Results Patients with GAD had significantly higher body perception scores than HCs. They also exhibited greater task-evoked activity in the left anterior insula, left posterior insula, and right anterior insula during interoceptive awareness than HCs. Left anterior insula activity was positively correlated with body awareness in patients with GAD, and rsFC between the left anterior insula and left medial prefrontal gyrus was negatively correlated with somatic anxiety severity. Conclusions Investigating a sample of first-episode, drug-naive patients, our study demonstrated abnormal interoceptive awareness in patients with GAD and that this was related to abnormal anterior insular activity during both rest and task. These results shed new light on the psychological and neural substrates of somatic symptoms in GAD, and they may serve to establish abnormal interoceptive awareness as a neural and psychological marker of GAD.

It is also a globally important invasive insect species. To test whether dark elytra colour is associated with greater cold hardiness, we compared the survival rate of prolonged cold exposure in both yellow and black colour morphs of female and male H. axyridis. We determined the trehalose and glycogen content, trehalase activity, and the dynamics of genes associated with the trehalose metabolic pathway. Yellow forms predominated before winter began, however black forms increased from 11.15 to 30.46% after overwintering. There was no significant difference in trehalose content between the females and males during overwintering. Glycogen content in over-wintering yellow females and black males increased significantly, while it decreased in black females. Soluble trehalase activity increased significantly in all the insects except black females. Membrane-bound trehalase activity increased in black males, and decreased in black females. Trehalose and glycogen content and trehalase activity were regulated by differential expression of TRE and TPS genes. Female beetles weighed more than males and survived in low temperatures for longer periods of time, regardless of elytra colour, suggesting that mass is a stronger predictor of overwintering survival rather than colour morph. Our results provide a guide for comparing cold resistance in insects and a theoretical basis for cold storage of H. axyridis for use as natural enemies of pests in biological control programs.

In the stimulated regions, low-frequency (<= 1 Hz) rTMS induces inhibitory effects, while high-frequency (>= 5 Hz) stimulation induces excitatory effects. However, these stereotypical effects arising from low- and high-frequency stimulation are based on measurements of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) induced by pulsed stimulation. To test the effects of rTMS on remote brain regions, the current study recruited 31 young healthy adults who participated in three rTMS sessions (10 Hz high frequency, 1 Hz low frequency, and sham) on three separate days. The stimulation target was based on individual fMRI activation in the motor cortex evoked by a finger movement task. Pre- and post-rTMS resting-state fMRI (RS-fMRI) were acquired. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) and degree centrality (DC) were calculated to measure the local and global connectivity, respectively. Compared with the sham session, high-frequency (10 Hz) rTMS significantly increased ReHo and DC in the right cerebellum, while low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation did not significantly alter ReHo or DC. Then, using a newly developed PAIR support vector machine (SVM) method, we achieved accuracy of 93.18-97.24% by split-half validation for pairwise comparisons between conditions for ReHo or DC. While the univariate analyses suggest that high-frequency rTMS of the left motor cortex could affect distant brain activity in the right cerebellum, the multivariate SVM results suggest that both high- and low-frequency rTMS significantly modulated widespread brain activity. The current findings are useful for increasing the understanding of the mechanisms of rTMS, as well as guiding precise individualized rTMS treatment of movement disorders.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a Resonant Structure in e(+)e(-) -> K+ K- pi(0)pi(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							Y(2175); STATE	A partial-wave analysis is performed for the process e(+)e(-) -> K+ K- pi(0)pi(0) at the center-of-mass energies ranging from 2.000 to 2.644 GeV. The data samples of e(+)e(-) collisions, collected by the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider with a total integrated luminosity of 300 pb(-1), are analyzed. The total Born cross sections for the process e(+)e(-) -> K+ K- pi(0)pi(0) as well as the Born cross sections for the subprocesses e(+)e(-) -> phi pi(0)pi(0), K+(1460)K-, K-1(+)(1400)K-, K-1(+)(1270)K-, and K*(+) (892)K*(-) (892), are measured versus the center-of-mass energy. The corresponding results for e(+)e(-) -> K+ K- pi(0)pi(0) and phi pi(0)pi(0) are consistent with those of BABAR with better precision. By analyzing the cross sections for the tour subprocesses, K+(1460)K-, K-1(+)(1400)K-, K-1(+)(1270)K-, and K*(+) (892)K*(-) (892) a structure with mass M = (2126.5 +/- 16.8 +/- 12.4) MeV/c(2) and width Gamma = (106.9 +/- 32.1 +/- 28.1) NleV is observed with an overall statistical significance of 6.3 sigma, although with very limited significance in the subprocesses e(+)e(-) -> K-1(+)(1270)K-, and K*(+) (892)K*(-) (892). The resonant parameters of the observed structure suggest it can be identified with the phi(2170), thus the results provide valuable input to the internal nature of the phi(2170).

However, the underlying mechanism causing hepatocyte senescence in this pathological condition is still unclear. A thorough understanding of the mechanism could provide a new target for therapeutic intervention. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of p66shc in hepatocyte senescence and hepatocyte damage in NAFLD progression. Material/Methods: We examined the expression levels of hepatic p66shc and senescence markers in rats and humans with NAFLD, and we assessed the effect of p66shc knockdown or overexpression on senescence and steatosis in human liver cells. Results: In this study, we showed that increased hepatic p66shc expression was consistent with upregulated expression of the following senescence markers in NAFLD rats: heterochromatin protein-1-beta (HP1 beta), p16, p21, and p53. Furthermore, senescence and steatosis could be induced in hepatoblastoma cell line (HepG2) cells when cells were stimulated with a low concentration of H2O2, and this effect was significantly alleviated by knockdown of p66shc. However, overexpression of p66shc could promote senescence and steatosis in L02 cells. Finally, increased hepatic p66shc protein levels correlated with enhanced expression of the senescence marker p21 and mirrored the degree of disease severity in NAFLD patients. Conclusions: Our findings indicated that the increase in hepatocyte senescence and steatosis in NAFLD may be caused by the upregulation of p66shc expression, implying that strategies for p66shc-mediated regulation of hepatocyte senescence may provide new therapeutic tools for NAFLD.

In this work, we propose an idea to realize quantum gates by manipulating quantum states outside their DFS but having the states of the logical qubits remain in their DFS before and after the gate operation. This proposal has the following features: (i) because the states are manipulated outside the DFS, the multiqubit gate implementation can be simplified when compared to realizing a multiqubit gate via manipulating quantum states within the DFS, which usually requires unitary operations over a large DFS, and (ii) because the states of the logical qubits return to the DFS after the gate operation, the errors caused by decoherence during the gate operation are not accumulated for a long-running calculation, and the states of the logical qubits are immune to decoherence when they are stored. Based on this proposal, we then present a way for realizing a multi-target-qubit controlled-NOT gate using logical qubits encoded in a decoherence-free subspace against collective dephasing. This gate is realized by employing qutrits (three-level quantum systems) placed in a cavity or coupled to a resonator. This proposal has the following advantages: (i) the states of the logical qubits return to their DFS after the gate operation; (ii) the gate can be implemented with only a few basic operations; (iii) the gate operation time is independent of the number of logical qubits; (iv) this gate can be deterministically implemented because no measurement is needed; (v) the intermediate higher-energy level for all qutrits is not occupied during the entire operation, thus decoherence from this level is greatly suppressed; (vi) this proposal is universal and can be applied to realize the proposed gate using natural atoms or artificial atoms (e.g., quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and various superconducting qutrits, etc.) placed in a cavity or coupled to a resonator. As an application, we also show how to apply this gate to create a Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) entangled state of multiple logical qubits encoded in DFS, and further investigate the experimental feasibility for creating the GHZ state of three logical qubits in the DFS, by using six superconducting transmon qutrits coupled to a one-dimensional coplanar waveguide resonator.

Most HKMTases have a conserved SET (Su(var) 3-9,E(z),Trithorax) domain, while the HKMTases with SET domains are called the SET domain group (SDG) proteins. In plants, only SDG proteins can work as HKMTases. In this review, we introduced the classification of SDG family proteins in plants and the structural characteristics of each subfamily, surmise the functions of SDG family members in plant growth and development processes, including pollen and female gametophyte development, flowering, plant morphology and the responses to stresses. This review will help researchers better understand the SDG proteins and histone methylation in plants and lay a basic foundation for further studies on SDG proteins.

Here, a self-derived superhydrophobic and multifunctional polymer composite foam is prepared by adsorption of the Ag precursor in tetrahydrofuran (THF) onto the rubber sponge followed by reduction of Ag+ to Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs). During the Ag+ reduction in hydrazine solution, the swollen rubber sponge by THF is partially precipitated based on the nonsolvent-induced phase separation (NIPS). The NIPS creates a porous structure on the sponge surface and thus a high surface roughness, contributing to the material superhydrophobicity. The precipitated polymer wrapping the AgNPs could enhance the interaction between the individual AgNPs. The obtained conductive sponge composite possesses excellent Joule heating and photothermal performance and can be used as both a strain and pressure sensor. The conductive sponge composite sensor possesses good reliability and durability and can be applied to real-time monitoring of human body movements.

Methods Twelve healthy women were recruited as subjects (age: 20.1 +/- 1.2 years, height: 163.4 +/- 3.7 cm, weight: 57.9 +/- 4.9 kg). The 10-camera Vicon MX13 + motion capture system was used to collect squat and shallow squat motion images at 250 Hz sample rate and a Kistler force plate was used to collect ground reaction force at a 1000 Hz sample rate. The two-way ANOVA (alpha = .05) was applied to assess for significance. Results The knee joint torque increased as the weight increased (p < .001). The weight affects maximum knee flexion and joint torque during extension, but no difference was found between the squat and shallow squat methods. Greater knee maximum adduction/abduction and internal/external rotation torque were found in squat lifting. Conclusion The squat and shallow squat had a similar knee loading under the same weight. Shallow squatting yielded better knee stability, which makes it more suitable for the general female population. Squat training was found to be more suitable for well-trained athletes.

In this work, a series of the amino acid based methoxy-poly (ethylene glycol)-b-(poly (gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate-co/b-L-phenylalanine) block copolymers (mPEG-b-P (ELG-co/b-Phe)s) with similar block chain length, but different proportion and sequence of gamma-ethyl-L-glutamate (ELG) and L-phenylalanine (Phe) arrangements were prepared through ring-opening polymerization method. The influence of the ratio and sequence structures of mPEG-b-P (ELG-co/b-Phe)s on their thermosensitive aqueous gelation behaviors were investigated in detail. The results showed that the obtained polymers showned higher modulus (G') and lower critical gelation temperature with higher proportion of L-phenylalanine. However, the physical properties start to deteriorate as the copolymers have a large number of phenylalanine groups. To clarify this phenomenon, the analysis of secondary structure with circular dichroism (CD) and fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrum showed that random coil reached a higher percentage as incorporated phenylalanine groups increased. On the other hand, the polymers with different sequence and similar compositions exhibited divergence due to the influence of random coil conformation. In addition, the good biocompatibility of mPEG-b-P (ELG-co-Phe)s were observed in vitro and in vivo. The copolymers have the potential to be used as thermo-sensitive injectable hydrogels for biomedical applications.

The obtained RS-CSPUNGs not only show a good size distribution with the hydrodynamic radii around of 20 nm, but also exhibit good stability in the organic solvent. The results demonstrate that GSH (10 mM) trigger the nanogel swelling and accelerate the loaded drug release in PBS (pH = 7.4). Although the RS-CS-PUNGs loaded with DOX show a slower cellular uptake behavior than the free doxorubicin (DOX), which is likely caused by the controlled drug release property of the nanocarrier, the enhanced cellular uptake fluorescence intensity of RS-CS-PUNGs loaded with DOX is still observed compared to the control group. Both MTT and CCK-8 assay indicate that although an obvious lower initial cytotoxicity is observed compared to free DOX at 24 h postincubation, the cytotoxicity of the RS-CS-PUNGs loaded with DOX is obvious enhanced after treated 72 h, which stayed at the similar level with free DOX. Attributing to the easy preparation progress and GSH-responsive property, RS-CS-PUNGs maybe hold the potential for further application in the field of drug delivery. (c) 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The electrode was constructed through the co-immobilization of the glucose oxidase micro-particles (GOD MPs) and multi-wall carbon nanotubes (CNT) on the inner surface of a gradient-structured hollow fiber membrane (GHM), where CNT improved the electron transport efficiency and GHM controlled the transfer of substances and interferences. GOD MPs showed higher stability under various operation conditions than the free enzymes due to the MnCO3 template method, which enabled the biosensor to remain relative sensitivity at >86% over 9 days. The GOD MPs biosensor also showed high selectivity, reproducibility, and linear sensing range from 0 mM to 24 mM (R-2 = 0.9993) with a current sensitivity of 25 nA/mM. The combination of porous-structured membrane and the flexible CNT meshes ensures the electrical connections and sensing accuracy of the biosensor under the deformation status. In-vivo experiments showed reliable current responses to variations in blood glucose concentrations that were consistent with tail blood test results. This co-immobilization of enzyme micro-particles in the 3D porous structure method developed a bio-composite platform technology towards the applications in flexible sensing and implantable medical devices.

Design/methodology/approach According to calculation of equivalent series capacitors and change of voltage at the comparator input node, two three-stage structures of capacitor arrays and a general design flow of the multi-stage capacitor arrays were presented. Non-ideal factors on the capacitor arrays were analyzed, and the applications of the two structures were explained based on the capacitor mismatch. Findings A multi-stage capacitor array for 16-bit SAR ADCs was implemented. The simulation result shows that its nonlinear error was less than 0.3LSB with no gain error and the sampling capacitance accounted for 92.42% of the total capacitance. Effects of capacitive parasitic and mismatch on capacitor arrays were confirmed. Originality/value The proposed method focused on capacitor arrays design of high-resolution SAR ADCs. It effectively reduced nonlinear errors, improved SNR and optimized the area of SAR ADCs. The design method was suitable for SAR ADCs with different resolutions to improve their precision.

Methods This cross-sectional survey was conducted by administering an online questionnaire in May 2016. The survey was performed across Thirty provinces. In total, A total of 3016 Chinese doctors were selected as participants, of which 2617 completed valid questionnaires (effective response rate: 86.77%). Results The overall prevalence of burnout symptoms among Chinese doctors was 85.79%. Little variance was reported for burnout symptoms according to age (Wald chi(2) = 6.843, P < 0.05, OR < 1), professional title (Wald chi(2) = 13.110, P < 0.05, OR > 1), and daily working hours (Wald chi(2) = 7.226, P < 0.05, OR > 1). However, the burnout of Chinese doctors was found to be associated with psychological attachment (B = - 0.6433, P < 0.0001) and career calling (B = 0.3653, P < 0.0001); furthermore, psychological attachment (B = 0.2350, P < 0.001) mediated the relationship between job burnout and career calling. Conclusion Burnout symptoms among Chinese doctors were prevalent and associated with age, professional title, and long working hours. Chinese doctors aged 20-30 experienced a much higher level of burnout symptoms. The longer hours doctors worked, the more likely they were at risk of burnout symptoms, especially among attending physicians. Doctors who endured high-level burnout tended to exhibit decreasing psychological attachment, which threatened their sense of career calling. Finally, this paper proposed related explanations for the function mechanisms based on both theoretical and practical perspectives.

However, problems remain in the application, such as long startup period and susceptibility to environmental variations. Quorum sensing (QS), as a means of bacterial communication, attracts more attentions in regulating aggregation behavior and microbial density. Many physiological characteristics of anammox bacteria have been confirmed to be associated with QS, including specific anammox activity, growth rate and the production of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), which directly affect the performance of anammox process. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the QS in anammox process is prerequisite. This work systematically reviewed the role and application of QS in the anammox process with the focus on mechanism. Additionally, current challenges and research needs were proposed.

However, few studies have investigated the relationship between the public goods provided by village collectives and the subjective well-being (SWB) of rural residents. This study aims to fill that gap. Based on the 2014 round of China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) survey data, this study estimates an ordered logit model of a SWB function to examine the role of the public goods provided by village collectives. The results indicate that village collectives' provision of public goods has a significantly positive effect on the SWB of rural residents by promoting the dual growth of household income and consumption. Village collectives' public expenditures on production, education, and public services also positively affect the SWB of rural residents. The public goods provided by village collectives have a significantly positive effect on the SWB of young and middle-aged rural residents but not on the SWB of elderly rural residents. Finally, rural residents with low levels of education and health obtain more SWB effects than do residents with high levels.

It is known that the electrical resistance of the CPCs is dominated by the conductive networks in the polymer matrix. Therefore, tiny change of the conductive networks can lead to remarkable changes in the output electrical signal of the CPCs. Utilizing this stimulus-response behavior of conductive networks to the environment conditions, CPCs can be used to design sensitive sensors to detect or monitor the environment conditions, such as the strain/stress, pressure, temperature, solvent or vapor. This review systematically outlines the preparation, microstructures, properties, and the stimulus-response mechanisms to the environment conditions of the CPCs as well as their applications in various sensitive sensors, including strain sensors, pressure sensors, liquid sensors, vapor sensors, and temperature sensors. Finally, the open question and future challenge of utilizing the stimulus-response behavior of CPCs to design versatile sensors are discussed.

The present study used event-related potentials (ERPs) to investigate the time course and the neural correlate of statistical learning of positional consistency in Chinese orthography. Visual ERPs were recorded, while Chinese adults performed an orthographic statistical learning task involving artificial characters varying in high, moderate, and low levels of positional consistency. The negative ERP deflection at the N1 time window, typically linked with orthographic regularity processing, was found in orthographic statistical learning with the low and moderate consistencies eliciting larger neural responses than the high consistency in the time window of 150-210 ms over occipital-temporal brain areas. These results suggest that orthographic statistical learning begins within the first 210 ms and that the N1 might be its neural indicator.

In this study, we applied DNA metabarcoding to dental calculus of premodern Japan for the taxonomic identification of food items. DNA was extracted from 13 human dental calculi from the Unko-in site (18th-19th century) of the Edo period, Japan. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing were performed using a primer set specific to the genus Oryza because rice (Oryza sativa) was a staple food and this was the only member of this genus present in Japan at that time. DNA metabarcoding targeting plants, animals (meat and fish), and fungi were also carried out to investigate dietary diversity. We detected amplified products of the genus Oryza from more than half of the samples using PCR and Sanger sequencing. DNA metabarcoding enabled us to identify taxa of plants and fungi, although taxa of animals were not detected, except human. Most of the plant taxonomic groups (family/genus level) are present in Japan and include candidate species consumed as food at that time, as confirmed by historical literature. The other groups featured in the lifestyle of Edo people, such as for medicinal purposes and tobacco. The results indicate that plant DNA analysis from calculus provides information about food diversity and lifestyle habits from the past and can complement other analytical methods such as microparticle analysis and stable isotope analysis.

For a two-dimensional (2D) superlattice monolayer film composed of a given metal nanostructure, it is rather challenging to tune either its plasmonic properties or its optical properties in a reversible way, and it has not been reported. It is therefore of significant value to construct a free-standing 2D superlattice monolayer film of gold nanoparticles with an intelligent response and desired functions. Herein, we developed an easy and efficient approach to construct a gold nanoparticle superlattice film with a dual-responsive plasmonic switch. In this system, gold nanoparticles were coated by polyaniline (PANT) and then interracially self-assembled into a monolayer film at the air-liquid interface. The PANI shell plays two important roles in the superlattice monolayer film. First, the PANI shell acts as a physical spacer to provide a steric hindrance to counteract the van der Waals (vdW) attraction between densely packed nanoparticles (NPs), resulting in the formation of a superlattice by adjusting the thickness of the PANI shell. Second, the PANI shells provide the superlattice film with multiple stimuli such as electrical potential and pH change, leading to reversible optical and plasmonic responsiveness. The superlattice monolayer film can show a vivid color change from olive green to pink, or from olive green to violet by the change of the corresponding stimuli. Also, the localized surface plasmonic resonance (LSPR) of the superlattice monolayer film can be reversibly modulated by both by changing the local pH and applying an electric potential. Notably, a significant plasmonic shift of 157 nm can be achieved in the superlattice monolayer film when the PANI shell with a thickness of 35 nm and gold nanorods as a core were used. The superlattice monolayer film with dual-responsive plasmonic switches is promising for a range of potential applications in optoelectronic devices, plasmonic and colorimetric sensors, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS).

J	Zheng, DY				Zheng, De-Yin			Minimal realisations of odd transfer functions for first-degree nD systems	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CONTROL			English	Article						Multidimensional systems; state-space realisation; absolutely minimal realisation; odd transfer function; skew-symmetric matrix	STATE-SPACE REALIZATION	Minimal realisation problems of odd transfer functions for first-degree (multi-linear) nD single-input single-output discrete systems have been studied, but it has not been well solved. This paper provides a new, different method to solve absolutely minimal realisation problems. By methods of limits and algebraic techniques, without using the symbolic approach by Grobner basis, the requirements of absolutely minimal realisation are transformed into a system of equations represented by the determinants. Since the equations for first-degree 2D systems are solvable by quadratic equations and the conditions for higher-dimensional realisations can be expressed by the results of 2D systems, the absolutely minimal realisations for nD systems can be found by using the realisations of n(n - 1)/2 2D systems. Furthermore, the conditions for existence and construction of the absolutely minimal realisation for the lack of items and not missing two cases are derived from the Pfaffian function of the skew-symmetric matrix. Finally, two numerical examples for 3D and 4D systems are presented to illustrate the basic ideas as well as the effectiveness of the proposed procedure.

Liver injury is one of these that severely affects patients with diabetes. Fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1) has glucose-lowering activity and plays a role in modulation of several liver injuries. Nevertheless, the effects and potential mechanisms of FGF1 against diabetes-induced liver injury are unknown. Methods To further investigate the effect of FGF1 on diabetic liver injury, we divided db/db mice into two groups and intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected either with FGF1 at 0.5 mg/kg body weight or saline every other day for 4 weeks. Then body weights were measured. Serum and liver tissues were collected for biochemical and molecular analyses. Results FGF1 significantly reduced blood glucose and ameliorated diabetes-induced liver steatosis, fibrosis, and apoptosis. FGF1 also restored defective hepatic autophagy in db/db mice. Mechanistic investigations showed that diabetes markedly induced oxidative stress and endoplasmic reticulum stress and that FGF1 treatment significantly attenuated these effects. Conclusions FGF1-associated glucose level reduction and amelioration of cellular stress are potential protective effects of FGF1 against diabetes-induced liver injury.

Benefiting from the advances of network science and high-throughput biomedical technologies, studying the biological systems from network biology has attracted much attention in recent years, and networks have long been central to our understanding of biological systems, in the form of linkage maps among genotypes, phenotypes, and the corresponding environmental factors. In this review, we summarize the recent developments of computational network biology, first introducing various types of biological networks and network structural properties. We then review the network-based approaches, ranging from some network metrics to the complicated machine-learning methods, and emphasize how to use these algorithms to gain new biological insights. Furthermore, we highlight the application in neuroscience, human disease, and drug developments from the perspectives of network science, and we discuss some major challenges and future directions. We hope that this review will draw increasing interdisciplinary attention from physicists, computer scientists, and biologists. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Yu, L; Lu, JB				Yu, Lin; Lu, Jianbo			Effects of population size and structure on reproductive success of a Pistacia chinensis population	PLANT BIOSYSTEMS			English	Article						Dioecious plant; pollen density; artificial pollination; sex ratio; dioecious plants conservation; Thousand-Island Lake	POLLEN-LIMITATION; GENETIC DIVERSITY; PRIMULA-ELATIOR; LANDSCAPE; FRAGMENTATION; DISPERSAL	The Thousand-Island Lake region, a highly fragmented landscape in Zhejiang Province, China, was selected as a natural laboratory to examine how the reproductive success of a Pistacia chinensis (Anacardiaceae) population was affected by population size and structure. Thirty local island populations and one large mainland population were studied. Pollen density during the flowering season differed significantly among four differently sized populations. The number of pollen grains on the female stigma was positively related to the size of the male population. The 100-seed weight and seed-setting rate of fruits were also significantly correlated with the size of the male population. These results indicated that pollen limitation caused by a reduction in the size of the male population in this fragmented landscape was the main factor that reduced the female reproductive success of the P. chinensis population. In the small population, artificial pollination resulted in significant increases in the 100-seed weight and the seed-setting rate compared with those of untreated individuals. However, artificial pollination did not significantly increase the 100-seed weight or seed-setting rate in the large population. Pollen limitation caused by a reduction in the size of male population was the main factor that reduced the female reproductive success of the P. chinensis population in this fragmented landscape. Thus, the size of populations is an important factor in developing conservation and protection strategies for dioecious plant species in fragmented habitats.

In the first case-control study, the subjects were chosen from the general population of Zhejiang province in order to assess the association between leucocyte telomere length and risk of hearing loss from 2016 to 2018. A total of 817 cases (55.93 +/- 8.99 years) and 817 age-, sex- and residential city-matched controls (55.91 +/- 9.03 years) were included for analysis. In the multivariable models, individuals in the top quartile of relative telomere length (RTL) had an odds ratio (OR) for hearing loss of 0.53 (95% confidence intervals [CI], 0.38-0.74) compared to those in the bottom quartile, and specifically, the OR was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.28-0.73) in females. In females, the risk of hearing loss decreased by 46% as RTL doubling increased; the standard deviation of RTL was associated with a 29% decrease in hearing loss risk. Additional analysis showed significant difference between participants in the female mild hearing loss group and corresponding controls. These results suggest that telomere length is associated with hearing loss in the general population, particularly in females with mild hearing loss. Telomere length might be a potential predictive biomarker of hearing loss at early stage.

J	Wang, H; Jiang, CX				Wang, Hao; Jiang, Chengxu			Local Nuances of Authoritarian Environmentalism: A Legislative Study on Household Solid Waste Sorting in China	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						local legislation; household solid waste; authoritarian environmentalism	GOVERNANCE; IMPLEMENTATION; SINGAPORE	Faced with an unprecedented increase in the amount of solid waste, China aims to tighten its waste management regulation. Corresponding local policy experiments are encouraged. This study explores China's authoritarian environmentalism through an examination of local legislations on Household Solid Waste (HSW) sorting. We present a full picture of relevant local legislation from five key dimensions: local legislative outputs, local standards of HSW classifications, reward and penalty provisions, the use of the social credit system and duties imposed on local governments. We then compare policy-making models based on the experience of Shanghai and Guangzhou. We find China's HSW sorting policy has been dominated by the central state. The local lawmaking process is generally non-transparent and non-participative. When attempting to mobilize the public, local policymakers emphasize educating the public about "how to" instead of "why to sort wastes". Also, while the central waste management policies are generally undermined locally, some sub-national governments do demonstrate a strong commitment to push the national policy through. Multiple factors account for this pattern. Though civic engagement did emerge in certain localities where civil society was relatively active, authoritarian environmentalism will continue to prevail in China in the near future.

The activation energies E-c(x) of crystallization for the Pr2Fe14B phase increase rapidly first and then increase slowly to a maximum value 440 kJ/mol at the crystallization value of 40%, while the E-c(x) of Fe3B phase is mostly lower at the stage of crystallization and then increases gradually with the increase of crystallization fraction. Meanwhile, the enhanced magnetic properties (H-cj, 215 kA/m; M-r, 116 A m(2)/kg; and (BH)(max), 73.9 kJ/m(3)) have been obtained for the alloy with the annealing temperature at 660 degrees C. The results of magnetization reversal behavior show that a stronger exchange-coupling interaction between the hard and soft phases can be obtained by the proper annealing temperature.

Addiction severity modulates the precuneus involvement in internet gaming disorder: Functionality, morphology and effective connectivity	PROGRESS IN NEURO-PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY & BIOLOGICAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						IGD severity; Precuneus; Cue-craving task; Morphology; Effective connectivity	SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CUE-REACTIVITY; EXECUTIVE FUNCTION; SMOKING CUES; METAANALYSIS; ACTIVATION; NEUROCIRCUITRY; INDIVIDUALS; ASSOCIATION	Although higher precuneus activation has often been observed in subjects with addictions when facing addiction-relevant cues, the recruitment of the precuneus is not consistent across studies. Here, we examined the extent to which addiction severity may relate to precuneus involvement during cue reactivity in internet gaming disorder (IGD). We recruited 65 subjects with IGD, collected brain responses when exposed to gaming cues and assessed brain structure. We correlated IGD severity with brain responses during a cue-craving task, precuneus volume, and connectivity with respect to inputs/outputs to/from the precuneus. In the cue-craving task, IGD severity was positively correlated with precuneus activation when exposed to gaming cues. IGD severity was also positively correlated with the volume of precuneus and connectivity from the hippocampal gyrus to the precuneus. IGD severity was also negatively correlated with connectivity from the middle frontal gyrus to the precuneus. In IGD, IGD severity relates to precuneus involvement with respect to functionality, morphology, and connectivity. The precuneus may act as a platform for integrating potential contradictory information between executive control and sub-cortical cravings.

Traditional Chinese opera was organized for the intervention group for 12 weeks. The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), the Chinese version of the neuropsychiatric inventory (CNPI), and Quality of Life in Alzheimer's disease (QOL-AD) assessed the effectiveness at the pre-test stage and after 6 and 12 weeks of the intervention, and generalized estimated equation was used for statistical analysis. Statistically significant (P < 0.05) differences were observed between the intervention and control groups in terms of MMSE, CNPI, and QOL-AD. Traditional Chinese opera can potentially be an effective therapy for improving the cognitive function of older adults with dementia, reducing their behavioral and psychiatric symptoms and enhancing their quality of life.

PA showed substantial variations across China, exhibiting an average of 0.88 keq ha(-1) yr(-1) in 2016. The spatial variation in SO42- deposition than that in NO3- deposition was closer to the spatial variation in PA, contributing 78.7% of the PA throughout China. Eastern China had significantly higher PA values than western China with four hotspots in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD), northern China (NC) and the Sichuan Basin (SCB). In eastern China, the PA values increased by 5.0% between 2005 and 2007 and then decreased by 34.3% in 2016, while the PA values in western China increased by 14.7% between 2005 and 2012 and then decreased by 2.0% in 2016. For the four hotspots, the SO42- to NO3- ratio (S/N) decreased; moreover, the PA decreased in NC, PRD and SCB but slightly increased in the YRD.

The main approach is to reduce the full compressible Euler equations to an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations under the spherically symmetric and self-similar assumptions. We establish the detailed structures of solutions as well as their existence by analyzing carefully the properties of the integral curves of the autonomous ODE system.

To address this, we present Tourism Information Diffusion Ecosystem (TIDE), a novel theoretical framework to help understand this system of tourism SNS information diffusion. TIDE defines who participates in the system, what roles participants play in distributing tourist information contained within user-generated content, how content within a network is distributed, and if this user-generated information, once diffused, has been transferred into tourists' visiting actions, and the reasons why these actions have been generated. We discovered user typologies and the powerful characteristics of this network structure to be important factors affecting visiting actions in choosing particular tourist destinations.

The results of empirical research show that fiscal decentralization in China provides local governments with incentives for the development of high pollution industries and of large state-owned enterprises, which do not help the sustainable development of tourism. In addition, there is an "inverted U-shaped" relationship between pollution level and tourism development. Although the growth of China's tourism industry is pollution-based currently, tourism revenue is considered to decline once a threshold is reached. The competition from local governments for foreign investment is conducive to the improvement of environmental quality and increase in tourism revenue. Based on this, we have proposed a series of sustainable tourism development measures.

Mask crisis during the COVID-19 outbreak	EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Mask; Crisis; COVID-19 outbreak; SARS-CoV-2	CORONAVIRUS	On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. As of February 29, 2020, the National Health Commission of China has reported 79,389 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 34 provinces. The masks can be used to block respiratory transmission from human to human, and are an effective way to control influenza. It is, therefore, necessary to wear a mask when respiratory infectious diseases are prevalent. China has a population of 1.4 billion. Assuming that two-thirds of the people in China must wear a mask every day, the daily demand for masks will reach 900 million. The Chinese government has taken many measures to solve these problems. Additionally, more measures should be taken to properly dispose of mask garbage. Although the outbreak originated in China, person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed, which means that it can be spread to anywhere in the world if prevention measures fail. The issues regarding face mask shortages and garbage in China, therefore, deserve worldwide attention.

We found that the distribution of Wuhan's migrants is centred in Hubei Province (approximately 75%) at a provincial level, gradually decreasing in the surrounding provinces in layers, with obvious spatial characteristics of circle layers and echelons. The scale of Wuhan's migrants, whose origins in Hubei Province give rise to a gradient reduction from east to west within the province, and account for 66% of Wuhan's total migrants, are from the surrounding prefectural-level cities of Wuhan. The distribution comprises 94 districts and counties in Hubei Province, and the cumulative percentage of the top 30 districts and counties exceeds 80%. Wuhan's migrants have a large proportion of middle-aged and high-risk individuals. Their social characteristics include nuclear family migration (84%), migration with families of 3-4 members (71%), a rural household registration (85%), and working or doing business (84%) as the main reason for migration. Using a quasi-experimental analysis framework, we found that the size of Wuhan's migrants was highly correlated with the daily number of confirmed cases. Furthermore, we compared the epidemic situation in different regions and found that the number of confirmed cases in some provinces and cities in Hubei Province may be underestimated, while the epidemic situation in some regions has increased rapidly. The results are conducive to monitoring the epidemic prevention and control in various regions.

However, research suggests that parental monitoring often does not reduce children's problematic mobile phone use as expected. Based on the results of a survey of 584 Chinese adolescents, we found that parental monitoring positively predicted children's problematic mobile phone use (PMPU) within a Chinese cultural context. The results also showed that children's escape motivation partially mediated this relationship, while their level of shyness moderated both the mediated path and the direct impact of parental monitoring on children's PMPU. The findings suggested that a higher level of shyness increased the likelihood that parental monitoring would increase the child's escape motivation and PMPU. The study results provide guidelines for parents and educators regarding interventions for adolescents' problematic phone use.

Extensive study related to the architectural effects of compatibilizer on the compatibilization has mainly focused on the side chains. We investigated the influence of the compatibilizer-main-chain structure on the compatibilizing effect for immiscible poly(vinylidene fluoride)/poly(L-lactic acid) (PVDF/PLLA) blends. Two reactive-comb compatibilizers with polystyrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) as main chains and PMMA as the side chains have been synthesized. PS is immiscible with both PLLA and PVDF, while PMMA is miscible with PVDF. It was found that both compatibilizers can improve the compatibility between the PLLA and PVDF, with different compatibilization effects. In the PVDF/PLLA (50/50) blends, 1 wt.% poly(styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate)-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) (RC-SG) tuned the morphology from the droplet-in-matrix structure to the co-continuous structure, while the blends with poly(methyl methacrylate-co-glycidyl methacrylate)-graft-poly(methyl methacrylate) (RC-MMG) kept the sea-island structure with even 3 wt.% loading. Moreover, RC-SG induces a wider co-continuous interval range than RC-MMG. The co-continuous structure obtained by RC-SG was also more stable than that by RC-MMG. It was further found that RC-SG-compatibilized PVDF/PLLA blends exhibit higher mechanical properties than the RC-MMG-compatibilized blends.

Nevertheless, the pathological mechanisms of IGD remain elusive at present. Hence, we employed multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and spectral dynamic causal modeling (spDCM) to explore this issue. Methods: Resting-state fMRI data were collected from 103 IGD subjects (male = 57) and 99 well-matched recreational game users (RGUs, male = 51). Regional homogeneity was calculated as the feature for MVPA based on the support vector machine (SVM) with leave-one-out cross-validation. Mean time series data extracted from the brain regions in accordance with the MVPA results were used for further spDCM analysis. Results: Results display a high accuracy of 82.67% (sensitivity of 83.50% and specificity of 81.82%) in the classification of the two groups. The most discriminative brain regions that contributed to the classification were the bilateral parahippocampal gyrus (PG), right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and middle frontal gyrus (MFG). Significant correlations were found between addiction severity (IAT and DSM scores) and the ReHo values of the brain regions that contributed to the classification. Moreover, the results of spDCM showed that compared with RGU, IGD showed decreased effective connectivity from the left PG to the right MFG and from the right PG to the ACC and decreased self-connection in the right PG. Conclusions: These results show that the weakening of the PG and its connection with the prefrontal cortex, including the ACC and MFG, may be an underlying mechanism of IGD.

However, the efficacy and safety elemene combined with chemotherapy in advanced gastric cancer (GC) are lack of systematic assessment. Methods: we searched the PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China Academic Journals (CNKI), Chinese Science and Technology Journals (CQVIP) and Chinese Biomedical Literature databases. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing elemene plus chemotherapy with chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced GC and reporting at least one of the following outcomes were selected and assessed for inclusion. JADAD scale was used to assess the quality. Data was screened and extracted by two independent investigators. The primary clinical outcome was overall response rate (ORR); the secondary outcomes were quality of life (QOL) and adverse events (AEs). Analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.3. Results: Sixteen RCTs matched the selection criteria, which reported on 969 subjects. Risk ratios (RR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled for ORR, life quality based on KPS, and risk of AEs. Compared to chemotherapy alone, elemene combined with chemotherapy in the treatment of GC may increase the efficiency of ORR(RR: 1.41; 95% CI: 1.23-1.60; P < .0001), improve their life quality based on KPS (RR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.45-2.34; P < .00001), and reduce the adverse reactions, including leukopenia(RR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.62-0.85; P < .00001), neutropenia (RR: 0.75; 95% CI: 0.60-0.95; P = .02), anemia (RR: 0.76; 95% CI: 0.60-0.95; P = .02), thrombocytopenia (RR: 0.56; 95% CI: 0.43-0.73; P < .00001). Nausea and vomiting (RR: 0.84; 95% CI: 0.84-1.07; P = .39), diarrhea (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.41-1.15; P = .15), neurotoxicity (RR: 0.77; 95% CI: 0.59-1.00; P = .05) and hepatic dysfunction (RR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.58-1.54; P = .83) were similar between two groups. Conclusions: Elemene may have the potential to improve the efficacy and reduce the AEs of chemotherapy for gastric cancer. However, the long-term, high-quality researches with a large sample size in different populations are required.

Methods: Septic shock patients undergoing mechanical ventilation were included. Patients were randomized into two groups including propofol group and dexmedetomidine group. Plasma samples were obtained from veins at 0, 12, 24, 72 and 120 h after receiving mechanical ventilation in ICU. Results: Cohorts with septic shock after mechanical ventilation in ICU had similar baseline and demographic characteristics. Serum creatinine (SCr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was lower in dexmedetomidine group (P<0.05) and also lower renal injury markers were detected in the dexmedetomidine group, compared with propofol group (P<0.05). Dexmedetomidine infusion reduced the TNF-alpha, IL-1 level in blood samples and maintained the balance of proportion of CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes. Patients receiving dexmedetomidine were less likely to develop AKI. The median ICU stay was decreased in dexmedetomidine group (P<0.05). Moreover, the case and duration of CRRT was also decreased by using dexmedetomidine (P<0.05). There was no significant difference between the cohorts with respect to the duration of mechanical ventilation. Conclusions: The use of dexmedetomidine infusion in ICU patients was associated with a decreased incidence of AKI and reduced ICU stay and CRRT performance. The mechanism may be related to anti-inflammatory reaction and immunoregulation.

Therefore, in this study, we evaluated the hypothesis that telomere dysfunction in neutrophils may promote SVV via an LL37-NETs-dependent mechanism. Methods: We contrasted the release of neutrophil NETs from mice with telomere dysfunction, mice with DNA damage and wide-type mice. Neutrophil telomere length, the expression of LL37, and the formation of NETs were measured in SVV patients and healthy controls (HCs). The co-expression of gamma H2AX, LL37, and NETs were detected in SVV patients to evaluate the association of the immune aging of neutrophils and pro-inflammatory conditions. LL37 inhibitor was used to verify its key role in NETs release in SVV patients and DNA damage mice. Results: We found that NETs were over-induced by telomere dysfunction and DNA damage in mice, which may be associated with a marked increase in LL37. For patients with SVV, telomeres in neutrophils were significantly shortened, which was also associated with higher levels of LL37 and NETs. Inhibition of LL37 reduced the NETs released from neutrophils. Conclusions: Taken together, the results of these studies suggest that dysfunction of telomeres may promote SVV through the mechanism of LL37-dependent NETs. Thus, targeting the LL37-NETs may be a novel therapy for SVV.

Anisotropic critical behavior of current-driven skyrmion dynamics in chiral magnets with disorder	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						skyrmions; Hall effect; depinning phase transition; Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation; critical dynamics	ROOM-TEMPERATURE; MOTION; STATES	The dynamic pinning effects are significant in manipulating skymions in chiral magnetic materials with quenched disorder. Through numerical simulations of the non-stationary current-driven dynamics of skyrmions with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, the critical current, static and dynamic critical exponents of the depenning phase transition are accurately determined for both adiabatic and non-adiabatic spin-transfer torques and with different strengths of disorder, based on the dynamic scaling behavior far from stationary. We find that the threshold current is insensitive to a small non-adiabatic coefficient of the spin-transfer torque, but dramatically reduced for a large one. The critical exponents indicate that the critical dynamic behavior is robust for different spin-transfer torques in the perpendicular component of the Hall motion, while exhibits a weak universality class in the direction of the driving current. The anisotropic behavior around the depinning phase transition provides a quantitative analysis of the drive-dependent skyrmion Hall effect in experiments. Further, the theoretical analysis using the Thiele's approach is presented, and the critical current and the static exponents support the simulation results.

In order to deal with the parabolic degeneracy near the sonic curve, a novel set of dependent and independent variables are introduced to transform the Euler equations into a new system of governing equations which displays a clear regularity-singularity structure. With the help of technical characteristic decompositions, the existence of a local smooth solution for the new system is first established in a weighted metric space by using the iteration method and then expressed in terms of the original physical variables. This is the first construction of a classical sonic-supersonic solution near a sonic curve for the full Euler equations.

Here, we extracted and purified the air-oxidized RfxAc from the photoheterotrophically grown Roseiflexus castenholzii, and we illustrated the structural basis underlying its electron transferring features. Spectroscopic and enzymatic analyses demonstrated the reduction of air-oxidized RfxAc by the ACIII upon oxidation of menaquinol-4 and menaquinol-7. Crystal structures of the air-oxidized and Na-dithionite-reduced RfxAc at 2.2 and 2.0 angstrom resolutions, respectively, showed that the copper ions are coordinated by His77, His146, Cys141, and Met151 in minor different geometries. The Cu-1-S-delta bond length increase of Met151, and the electron density Fourier differences at Cu-1 and His77 demonstrated their essential roles in the dithionite-induced reduction. Structural comparisons further revealed that the RfxAc contains a Chloroflexus aurantiacus Ac-A-like copper binding pocket and a hydrophobic patch surrounding the exposed edge of His146 imidazole, as well as an Ac-B-like Ser- and Thr-rich polar patch located at a different site on the surface. These spectroscopic and structural features allow RfxAc to mediate electron transfers between the ACIII and redox partners different from those of Ac-A and Ac-B. These results provide a structural basis for further investigating the electron transfer and energy transformation mechanism of bacterial photosynthesis, and the diversity and evolution of electron transport chains.

However, they are also expected to avoid telling the truth in sensitive situations if doing so could be seen as inappropriate or impolite. Across two studies (total N = 358), the reasoning of 3- to 5-year-old children in such a scenario was investigated by manipulating whether the information in question would be helpful to the recipient. The studies used a reverse rouge paradigm, in which a confederate with a highly salient red mark on her nose asked children whether she looked okay prior to having her picture taken. In Study 1, children tended to tell the truth only if they were able to observe that the mark was temporary and the confederate did not know it was there. In Study 2, children tended to tell the truth only if they were able to observe that the mark could be concealed with makeup. These findings show that for children as young as age 3, decisions about whether to tell the truth are influenced by the likelihood that the information would be helpful to the recipient.

J	Tan, HL; Shen, B; Li, Q; Shu, HS				Tan, Hailong; Shen, Bo; Li, Qi; Shu, Huisheng			Non-fragile H-infinity control for body slip angle of electric vehicles with onboard vision systems: The dynamic event-triggering approach	JOURNAL OF THE FRANKLIN INSTITUTE-ENGINEERING AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article							STATE ESTIMATION; DESIGN; SUBJECT	This paper is concerned with the dynamic event-triggered non-fragile H-infinity control problem for the body slip angle of electric vehicles subject to parameter variations of vehicle controllers. Dynamics of electric vehicles with an onboard vision system is characterized by a linear model in which the body slip angle, the yaw rate, the lateral offset at the preview point and the vehicle heading angle are chosen as state variables. To reduce the energy consumption in signal transmission, a dynamic event-triggering mechanism is adopted to manage the data transmission between sensors and vehicle controllers. Our aim is to design a non-fragile event-triggered controller such that, for all possible parameter variations in controller gains, all the system states are asymptotically stable and the performance H(infinity )requirement is met. With the help of the Lyapunov theory, an existence condition of the desired controller is established first and then the desired controller gains are designed in terms of a feasible solution to a matrix inequality. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed non-fragile H-infinity control approach is verified in the electric vehicles. (C) 2020 The Franklin Institute. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Methods A cross-sectional survey was carried out on 624 patients in community health care centres in Hangzhou, China. A self-designed Likert scale was used to measure patients' perceptions on informational, managerial, and relational continuity of GP care. An average score for three types of continuity ranging from 0 to 100 was calculated. Linear regression models were developed to determine the factors influencing continuity. Results Average rating scores of 57.73 (+/- 15.31), 50.74 (+/- 17.18), 61.61 (+/- 18.07), and 63.57 (+/- 17.40) were found for total, informational, managerial, and relational continuity of care, respectively. Older patients reported a more positive rating on all types of continuity. Income was negatively associated with managerial continuity. The factors affecting informational, relational, and total continuities included chronic diseases, walking distance to nearest community health centres, signing a contract with a GP, and knowing the names of contracted GPs. Conclusion Patients' perception of continuity of GP care remains at a low level, especially for informational continuity. The varied association between continuity of care and identified factors suggests that targeted actions should be considered for improving the quality of GP services.

This supramolecular polymer hydrogel exhibits responsiveness to multiple stimuli induced by competitive ligands and temperature, and excellent self-healing properties after being destroyed by external forces. Furthermore, the introduction of TPE units into the supramolecular hydrogel endows it with bright blue fluorescence, satisfying the demand for protected quick response (QR) codes with improved durability and security. A three-dimensional QR code was then constructed using this blue-light-emitting fluorescent supramolecular polymer hydrogel, which could hide information under natural light at high temperature or in the presence of competitive ligands, but display it under UV light irradiation at low temperature. Therefore, the QR code information is in a protected state and can only be read under specific conditions. Moreover, due to the dynamic reversibility of non-covalent interactions, the protected QR code also shows excellent self-healing performance after being destroyed.

In this study we used the picture position decision task to investigate participants' electrical brain responses to both types of IE-ER. Electroencephalogram data were recorded simultaneously. Analysis of variance results show that the PIE-ER (vs. NIE-ER) group had significantly higher N1 amplitudes, shorter N1 latencies, and lower P1 amplitudes. The P1 amplitude in the left (vs. right) frontal brain region was significantly higher in both groups. In addition, as the PIE-ER (vs. NIE-ER) group had a greater ability to orient themselves to emotional stimuli, the cognitive resources they allocated to processing emotional stimuli decreased: Processing depth gradually became shallow, and emotion regulation elicited left frontal electrical asymmetry. Our findings provide a new understanding of unconscious emotion regulation, which may impact on physical and psychological intervention for the treatment of individuals' emotional problems and mental health, and well-being promotion.

Design of Compressed Sensing System With Probability-Based Prior Information	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA			English	Article						Sensors; Dictionaries; Sparse matrices; Matching pursuit algorithms; Optimization; Coherence; Noise measurement; Compressed sensing; prior information; probability; sensing matrix; sparse recovery; optimization techniques	OPTIMIZED PROJECTIONS; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; MATRIX; RECONSTRUCTION; DICTIONARIES; FRAMES	This paper deals with the design of a sensing matrix along with a sparse recovery algorithm by utilizing the probability-based prior information for compressed sensing systems. With the knowledge of the probability for each atom of the dictionary being used, a diagonal weighted matrix is obtained and then the sensing matrix is designed by minimizing a weighted function such that the Gram of the equivalent dictionary is as close to the Gram of dictionary as possible. An analytical solution for the corresponding sensing matrix is derived that requires low computational complexity. We also exploit this prior information through the sparse recovery stage and propose a probability-driven orthogonal matching pursuit algorithm that improves the accuracy of the recovery. Simulations for synthetic data and application scenarios of video streaming are carried out to compare the performance of the proposed methods with some existing algorithms. The results reveal that the proposed compressed sensing (CS) approach outperforms existing CS systems.

In a previous study, a conjugated polyketone reductase (CduCPR) was discovered to efficiently catalyse ketopantolactone (KPL) to d-PL with a high stereoselectivity. Nevertheless, this method was limited due to the expensive coenzyme, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrate (NADPH), and the poor stability of substrate KPL in pure aqueous buffer. Here, to overcome these problems, we developed a whole-cell biotransformation process to produce d-PL in a biphasic reaction system. Recombinant CduCPR and glucose dehydrogenase (BsuGDH) were co-expressed in Escherichia coli to simultaneously achieve the synthesis of d-PL and the regeneration of NADPH. The biphasic reaction system contained 15% dichloromethane (v/v) which significantly inhibited the undesirable hydrolysis of KPL. Approximately, 2.8% of 100 mM KPL was spontaneously hydrolysed to ketopantoic acid in the biphasic system, which was lower than 54% of pure aqueous buffer. The biphasic reaction system was optimized and scaled up to prepare d-PL. In a fed-batch biphasic reaction, the substrate KPL was continuously fed into the reactor after a batch reaction. The d-PL concentration reached 0.77 mol L-1 in the reaction mixture at 7 h, and its enantiomeric excess was 99%. This study presented an alternative method to asymmetrically synthesize enantiopure d-PL for further industrial application.

In the experiment, a masculinized and a feminized version of the self-faces of the participants were obtained by transferring the original faces toward the average male or female face. The participants were required to rate the attractiveness of three types (original, masculine, feminine) of their own faces and the other participants' faces in same-sex and opposite-sex contexts. The results revealed that the participants rated their own faces as more attractive than other participants rated them regardless of the sexually dimorphic type (original, masculine, feminine) or the evaluation context, More importantly, the male and female participants showed different preferences for the three types of self-faces. Specifically, in the same-sex context, the female participants rated their own original faces as significantly more attractive than the masculine and feminine faces, and the male participants rated their own masculine faces as significantly more attractive than the feminine faces; while in the opposite-sex context, no significant difference among the attractiveness scores of the three types of self-faces was found in both the male and female participants. The present study provides empirical evidence of the influence of sexual dimorphism on the evaluation of the attractiveness of self-faces.

J	Li, Q; Shen, B; Wang, ZD; Sheng, WG				Li, Qi; Shen, Bo; Wang, Zidong; Sheng, Weiguo			Recursive distributed filtering over sensor networks on Gilbert-Elliott channels: A dynamic event-triggered approach	AUTOMATICA			English	Article						Sensor networks; Time-varying nonlinear systems; Dynamic event-triggered scheme; Distributed filtering; Time-varying topologies; Gilbert-Elliott channels	TIME-VARYING SYSTEMS; STATE ESTIMATION; STABILITY	In this paper, the recursive distributed filtering problem is investigated for a class of discrete nonlinear time-varying systems under a dynamic event-triggered mechanism. The system outputs are collected through a sensor network subject to a time-varying topology that is connected via Gilbert-Elliott channels and governed by a set of Markov chains. In order to save communication cost, a dynamic event-triggered strategy is utilized to decide when a particular sensor node should broadcast the corresponding measurement output to its neighbors. For the addressed time-varying systems, our aim is to design a distributed filter for each sensor node such that an upper bound on the filtering error variance is guaranteed and subsequently minimized at each iteration under the dynamic event-triggered transmission protocol. The parameters of the desired filter are obtained recursively by following a certain set of recursions. Finally, an illustrative example is employed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic event-triggered distributed filtering algorithm. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Glycogen metabolism is one of the important physiological processes of insects, which is mainly regulated by glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP). In the present study, trehalose content was significantly reduced at 72 h after NlGP and NlGS knockdown, whereas glucose content was significantly increased at both 48 h and 72 h after GS knockdown. RNAi combined with RNA-Seq was used to identify NIGP- and NlGS-related pathways and genes in N. lugens. A total of 593 genes were up-regulated and 5969 genes were down-regulated after NlGP and NlGS knockdown, respectively. Moreover, the NlGS-knockdown group was mapped to 10,967 pathways, whereas the NlGP-knockdown group was mapped to 7948 pathways, and the greatest differences between the groups were associated with carbohydrate, lipid, amino acid and energy metabolism. Meanwhile, 1800, 1217, and 1211 transcripts in the NlGP-knockdown group and 2511, 1666, and 1727 transcripts in the NlGS-knockdown group were involved in bioprocess, cellular ingredients and molecular function, respectively. Almost all these genes were down-regulated by either NlGP or NlGS knockdown, with significant down-regulation of the 6-trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS), trehalase (TRE), GS, GP, phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase (PGM, n = 2), Insulin receptors (InRs) and insulin-like peptides (lips) genes. These results have demonstrated that RNAi-mediated NlGP and NlGS knockdown could lead to content of trehalose and glucose out of balance, but have no obvious effect on glycogen content, and have suggested that GS plays more complex role in other metabolism pathway of N. lugens.

PLANT GROWTH REGULATION			English	Article						CO2 concentration; Chromosome segment substitution line; QTL; Rice	GRAIN-YIELD; NATURAL VARIATION; LOCUS; TEMPERATURE; SENESCENCE; DYNAMICS; QUALITY	Rice source- and sink-associated traits are important for grain yield and are sensitive to environmental conditions. The continuing increase of CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere will become a major challenge for rice growth and development in the future due to changes in our climate such as extremes in temperature. To guarantee food safety, novel genetic loci need to be identified for source- and sink-associated traits that are specifically expressed under elevated CO2 conditions. Eighty chromosome segment substitution lines carrying japonica (Nipponbare) chromosome segments in the indica (9311) background were used in this study. QTL analysis was conducted for source- and sink-related traits, including flag leaf length, flag leaf width, flag leaf fresh weight, flag leaf dry weight, primary branch number, secondary branch number, grain number per panicle, panicle weight per plant, chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and carotenoid contents, under ambient CO2 concentrations and free-air CO2 enrichment. A total of 49 QTLs for these traits were detected on chromosomes 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 12 under the two conditions; the variance explained by these QTLs varied from 6.22 to 38.15%. Among these QTLs, 19 of them were detected under the natural field conditions and 30 were detected in the elevated CO2 conditions. In addition, 2 and 13 QTLs were specifically expressed in the natural and CO2-enriched conditions, respectively. Our findings have important implications on the utilization of germplasm resources for ensuring food security under elevated CO2 levels, especially for QTLs that were specifically detected under the elevated CO2 condition.

Cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) are potent inflammatory lipid mediators that exhibit actions mainly through activating type 1 and type 2 CysLT receptors (CysLT1 and CysLT2). Accumulating evidence shows that CysLT1 and CysLT2 are activated at different stages of pathological process in various cell types in the brain such as vascular endothelial cells, astrocytes, microglia, and neurons in response to insults. However, the precise roles and mechanisms of CysLT1 and CysLT2 in regulating the pathogenesis of cerebral ischemia, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease are not fully understood. In this article, we focus on current advances that link activation of CysLT1 and CysLT2 to the pathological process during brain ischemia and neurodegeneration and discuss mechanisms by which CysLT1 and CysLT2 mediate inflammatory process and brain injury. Multitarget anti-inflammatory potentials of CysLT1 and CysLT2 antagonism for neuroinflammation and brain injury will also be reviewed. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this study, we sought to determine whether speakers could affect their perceived vocal attractiveness by voluntarily shifting their own voices to reach specific target pitches ( + 20 Hz or - 20 Hz, a pitch increment that is based on prior research). Two sets of Chinese college students participated in the research: 115 who served as speakers whose voices were recorded, and 167 who served as raters who evaluated the speakers' voices. We found that when female speakers increased their pitch they were judged as more attractive to both opposite-sex and same-sex raters. An additional unexpected finding was that male speakers tended to rate other males who shifted their voice up in pitch as more attractive. These findings suggest that voluntary pitch shifts can affect attractiveness, but that they do not fully match the patterns observed when pitch shifting is done digitally.

The results show that the soft magnetic properties (SMPs) were obviously improved after the samples were annealed below the crystallization temperature with a 1 T magnetic field. The atom probe tomography (APT) results showed that the magnetic field has little effect on the element distribution of the annealed samples at 653 K. The results of XRD and TEM showed that the 653 K x 0 T sample included a few nanocrystals and an amorphous matrix while the 653 K x 1 T sample still retained an amorphous structure. It is worth noting that a large number of spherical symmetry clusters and a small number of translational symmetry clusters can be observed in the 653 K x 1 T sample. Many translational symmetry clusters, and a few spherical symmetry clusters, can be identified in the 693 K x 1 T sample. Both good soft magnetic properties (SMPs) and acceptable mechanical properties were obtained after the sample was annealed at 653 K. Compared with that of the as-cast sample, the values of maximum magnetic flux intensity (B-m), elastic modulus (E-r) and hardness increased by 13.7%, 36.6% and 9.4%, respectively, while the values of coercivity (H-c) and hysteresis loss (P-u) decreased by 71.5% and 68.2%, respectively. After the sample was annealed at 693 K, the SMPs exhibited a deterioration, and Er and hardness also dropped sharply. Based on the above results, the mechanism of the microstructural change for Fe80Si9B11 amorphous alloys related to the magnetic field annealing conditions was proposed. The relationship between the soft magnetic properties, mechanical properties, and the microstructure of the sample was also discussed. This paper provides a basis for the further improvement the SMPs of the Fe80Si9B11 amorphous ribbons by controlling the microstructure.

So far, the topological organization of whole-brain functional networks in IGD remains poorly understood. The inclusion of RGU as a control group could minimize the potential effects of gaming experience and gaming-related cue familiarity on the neural characteristics of IGD subjects. In the present study, we applied graph theoretical analysis to preliminarily explore the topological organization of intrinsic functional brain networks in IGD. 61 IGD participants and 61 matched RGU participants were recruited to undergo a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scan. The whole-brain functional networks were constructed by thresholding partial correlation matrices of 90 brain regions, and graph-based approaches were applied to analysis their topological attributes, including small-world, efficiency, and nodal centralities. Both of IGD and RGU groups showed efficient and economic small-world topology in brain functional networks. Although there was no significant group difference in global properties, subjects with IGD as compared to those with RGU showed increased nodal centralities in the reward, craving, emotional memory and sensory-motor processing regions. These results suggest that the functional network dysfunction, characterizing by heightened incentive motivation and sensory-motor coordination, may provide a new perspective for understanding the neural characteristics underlying IGD.

During the experiment, a plug of complexing agent was first injected to the inlet of capillary, followed by introducing the micelle-bound metal ions. Then the metal ions produced a micelle-to-solvent stacking effect and interacted with the complexing agent under a positive voltage. Continued application of voltage, the analytes were effectively focused and separated in the capillary zone electrophoresis. Repeatability was ranged from 1.89% to 1.94% for the migration time. The detection limits were 2.66-27.9 ng mL(-1) for Ni2+, Co2+, Cu2+ , Hg2+ and Cd2+. Furthermore, the developed method showed a great potential for the determination of metal ions in the crayfish, beebread and Dendrobium officinale samples.

The synthesized adsorbent was characterized by different spectroscopic techniques. Parameters influencing the extraction and complexation of methylmercury chloride, ethylmercury chloride and phenylmercury chloride such as type of eluent solvent, type and amount of adsorbent were investigated. In addition, linear ranges contained 2.00-300.00 ng mL(-1) for MeHg+, 5.00-500.00 ng mL(-1) for EtHe+ and PhHg+, and the established method presented good linearity (R-2 >= 0.998). Under the optimized experimental conditions, the ranges of detection limit and quantitation limit were 0.022-0.067 ng mL(-1) and 0.073-0.220 ng mL(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviations of intra- and inter-day analysis were less than 3.2 and 3.1%, respectively. Trueness of the present method was successfully accomplished by means of the recovery assays (81.4-98.5%) in the blank samples with two concentration levels. The repeatability %RSD of the method was lower than 2.7%. Overall, the developed approach proved to have the latent capability to be utilized in routine analysis of organic mercury compounds in fish and Dendrobium officinale.

In this work, we address the challenge of representing human perception in the visual analysis of scatterplots by introducing a novel deep-learning-based approach, ScatterNet, captures perception-driven similarities of such plots. The approach exploits deep neural networks to extract semantic features of scatterplot images for similarity calculation. We create a large labeled dataset consisting of similar and dissimilar images of scatterplots to train the deep neural network. We conduct a set of evaluations including performance experiments and a user study to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach. The evaluations confirm that the learned features capture the human perception of scatterplot similarity effectively. We describe two scenarios to show how ScatterNet can be applied in visual analysis applications.

However, the neural mechanism of emotion regulation for IGD is still unclear. Methods: Subjective evaluation and fMRI data were collected from 50 subjects (IGD: 24; recreational game user (RGU): 26) while they were performing an emotion reappraisal task. We collected and compared their brain features during emotion processing of different visual stimuli. Results: Higher activation in the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC), right ventral ACC, left claustrum and bilateral insula was observed in participants with IGD during emotion reappraisal relative to that of the RGU participants. In addition, generalized psychophysiological interaction analysis also showed that IGD participants had stronger functional connectivity between the right insula and bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) than the RGU participants. Conclusions: The results suggest that IGD participants could not down-regulate their negative emotional experiences as efficiently as the RGU participants, although they engaged more cognitive resources. These results reveal the special neural circuits of emotion dysregulation in IGD individuals and provide new neural perspective for the intervention of IGD.

In this paper, a series of donor-pi-acceptor (D-pi-A) molecules, incorporated with bis(trimethylsilyl)phenyl as a bridging group to twist molecular structure, were synthesized by Suzuki cross-coupling using diphenylamino and oxadiazole/triazole as electron-donating group and electron-withdrawing group, respectively. The resulting molecules exhibited high thermal stabilities and strong fluorescence at deep-blue regions in the solid state. Aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE) of p-DSiTO was observed because of the suppression of molecular vibration and rotation in the aggregated state. Furthermore, the locally excited (LE) emission was significantly increased to show hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) emission in the aggregated state. Theoretical calculations and electrochemical measurements were carried out for understanding optical and electrochemical properties in these molecules. Non-doped organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) fabricated using p-DSiTO as emitter showed deep-blue emission with CIEx,y (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) of (0.160, 0.105).

The development of reliable and effective sensors for PA using PL spectroscopy methods is practically significant. Among various PL sensors, conjugated polymers have emerged as a class of fascinating candidates for the detection of PA due to the "molecular wire" sensing mechanism. In this work, we synthesized and characterized two new di (naphthalen-2-yl)-1,2-diphenylethene (DNDPE)-based conjugated polymers with different conjugation degree and hydrophilicity. They show good solubility, aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) feature and high photostability. Both polymers exhibit sensitive fluorescence quenching by PA, and the KSV at the initial stage of the Stern-Volmer plots is up to 9.8 x 10(5)M(-1). In addition, after exposure to UV light, these polymers still could effectively detect the PA in water. They also could on-site detect PA with high sensitivity by preparing the polymer-immobilized fluorescent test strips. The results demonstrate that these new DNDPE-based conjugated polymeric sensors could be good candidates for the sensitive detection of PA.

The Fe-based biochar was applied to the soil at 1.5 and 3.0 t ha(-1), manure compost was also applied as a comparison, as well as a non-treated control. The application of the Fe-based biochar significantly (p < 0.05) increased the crop yields for the rice season in the first year, but the both treatments had no significant effect on the crop yields in the others cultivation seasons, compared to the control. The concentrations of available Cd and As significantly (p < 0.05) decreased after either higher or lower dose of Fe-based biochar addition, especially with lower rate in the second year. In the second year, the soil extractable Cd and As reduced by 57% and 18%, respectively, in the wheat season and 63% and 14%, respectively, in the rice season, after the lower dose of Fe-based biochar was applied. The lower dose of the Fe-based biochar treatment showed higher efficiency for decreasing Cd and As availability in soil than the higher one, the control and manure compost treatment. Additionally, both the higher and lower doses of the Fe-based biochar treatments significantly decreased Cd and As uptake by wheat and rice plants. Overall, the Fe-based biochar showed effective immobilization at an application of 1.5 t ha(-1), making the use of the Fe-based biochar feasible as an amendment for the safe use of agricultural land contaminated by Cd and As.

The liver is the main target organ for Cr(VI) accumulation; however, the effect of long-term Cr(VI) exposure on liver toxicity is largely unknown. In this study, we investigated the effect of chronic Cr(VI) exposure on liver fibrosis and its possible mechanism. Mice were injected with Cr(VI) for two months, and our results showed Cr(VI) treatment caused liver toxicity characterized by liver structure disorganization, liver dysfunction, and antioxidant enzyme system inhibition. The development of liver fibrosis was also found via the emergence of collagen fibril deposition, increased expression of extracellular matrix-related genes, activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and increase the expression levels of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway-related molecules. To demonstrate the role of Hh signaling in the regulation of Cr(VI)-induced liver fibrosis, genetically modified mice with heterozygous deficiency of Shh (Shh(+/-)) were used. In the Shh(+/-) mice, Hh signaling, HSCs activation and liver fibrosis development were all ameliorated. In conclusion, we demonstrated that Cr(VI)induced liver fibrosis development resulted from Hh pathway-mediated HSCs activation. Our findings strongly suggest that inhibition of Hh pathway may help in the development of new strategies for Cr(VI)-associated liver fibrosis.

In addition to the well established states, phi(1020), phi(1680), and K-3(*)(1780), contributions from X(1750), rho(2150), rho(3)(2250), and K-2* (1980) are also observed. The X(1750) state is determined to be a 1(--) resonance. The simultaneous observation of the phi(1680) and X(1750) indicates that the X(1750), with previous observations in photoproduction, is distinct from the phi(1680). The masses, widths, branching fractions of psi(3686) -> K+K- eta, and the intermediate resonances are also measured.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, N.; Chang, J. F.; Chang, W.

Among them, tin disulfide (SnS2) has attracted enormous research interests due to its low-cost, earth-abundant, environment friendly properties as well as superior performance in photodetectors. Here, an outstanding in-plane SnS2 phototransistor with an out-of-plane built-in electric field enabled by molybdenum oxide (MoO3) surface functionalization is demonstrated. The photocarriers are generated and effectively separated by the vertical electric field, leading to a high photoresponsivity of 2.3 x 10 (3) A center dot W-1, photoconductive gain of >10 (5), external quantum efficiency exceeding 8%. It also demonstrates a low noise power density, revealing an ultrasensitive photodetection with specific detectivity up to 3.2 x 10 (12) Jones. The formation of the out-of-plane built-in electric field is validated by the output electrical transport measurement of SnS2 vertical transistor, and further corroborated by in situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy characterizations. The findings promise surface functionalization as an effective approach to induce an internal electric field in 2D multilayer SnS2 towards its application in high performance photodetection.

Interestingly, all the mini Ni/C nanoparticles aggregate into bulky nanorods with similar to 200 nm diameter and several micrometer long. The uniform carbon nanoshells guarantee the formation of a large number of hot-spots between metal Ni nanoparticles, which results in the greatly strengthened and broadened Radar wave absorption based on a localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mechanism. For Ni/C nanotubes, the absorption bandwidth is up to 7.7 GHz when the reflection loss is over -10 dB, which means that about 1/2 EM wave can be effectively absorbed in the general Radar wave range of 2-18 GHz. Compared with dispersed Ni nanoparticles or Ni/C nanoparticles, every electromagnetic (EM) wave absorption character index of this product is greatly improved. So this work provides a new bottom-up construction method for EM absorption hot-spots.

Literature searches (up to September 25, 2019) were performed using the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PubMed, Chinese Science and Technology Journals (CQVIP), Wanfang, and China Academic Journals (CNKI) databases. Data from 14 randomized controlled trials (RCTs), with 1,109 participants, were included. The results indicated that, compared with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy alone, the combination of TCMs and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy significantly improved the tumor response rate (TRR; RR: 1.39; 95% CI: 1.24-1.57; p < 0.001, I (2) = 12%), increased the quality of life based on the Karnofsky Performance Scale score (RR: 1.53; 95% CI: 1.19-1.96; p < 0.001, I (2) = 0%), and reduced the side effects, such as neutropenia (RR: 0.68; 95% CI: 0.55-0.84; p < 0.001, I (2) = 44%), leukopenia (RR: 0.69; 95% CI: 0.54-0.90; p < 0.01, I (2) = 40%), thrombocytopenia (RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.46-0.96; p < 0.05, I (2) = 32%), and nausea and vomiting (RR: 0.50; 95% CI: 0.32-0.80; p < 0.01, I (2) = 85%). Hepatic dysfunction (RR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.33-1.20; p = 0.16, I (2) = 0%), neurotoxicity (RR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.26-1.55; p = 0.32, I (2) = 0%), and anemia (RR: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.40-1.04; p = 0.07, I (2) = 0%) were similar between the two groups. Evidence from the meta-analysis suggested that compared with paclitaxel-based chemotherapy alone, the combination of TCMs and paclitaxel-based chemotherapy may increase the TRR, improve quality of life, and reduce multiple chemotherapy-related side effects in gastric cancer patients. Additional rigorously designed large RCTs are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of this treatment.

This study aimed to analyze the disequilibrium in primary health care (PHC) workforce among various economic zones in China and to compare the fairness between urban and rural areas since the implementation of the new medical reforms. Method According to China's 11th Five-Year Plan, China is divided into eight economic regions. The data of this study were obtained from China Statistical Yearbook 2009-2016. The Atkinson index was used to depict the trend of PHC workforce fairness; the Gini coefficient was used to compare the fairness of workforce distribution between urban and rural areas; the health resource agglomeration degree was used to analyze the distributional equity of the workforce in the eight regions; and the Theil Index was used to compare the fairness of urban and rural workforce distribution across eight regions. Result The Atkinson index indicated that the equity of the entire PHC workforce allocation had generally improved during the new medical reforms; the Gini coefficient indicated that the fairness of the entire workforce allocation had improved in cities, but only the nurse allocation became fairer in rural areas. The agglomeration degree and the Theil index indicated that the fairness gaps across the eight regions were still large. These analyses differed from previous studies where China was divided into western, central and eastern regions. In what was previously defined as eastern region, the northeast was under-resourced, while the eastern coastal areas were observing a resource surplus. In western region, we found that the fairness in the northwest was significantly worse than southwest. Conclusion In China, the distribution of healthcare workforce has been improved with continuous effort. The gaps in the distribution of PHC workforce across different economic regions and between urban and rural areas are still large, with different regions facing different problems. The government should consider the population and geographical factors in allocation of PHC workforce, especially nurses.

Thus, looking for an effective therapy of RA has became an urgent issue nowadays. In this study, a novel thermosensitive liposome loaded with sinomenine hydrochloride (SIN-TSL) was developed by a pH gradient method. The SIN-TSL had a mean particle size of around 100 nm, and an high entrapment efficiency and drug loading capacity. The results also suggested that SIN-TSL had a thermosensitive drug release behaviour, with the drug release rate at 43 degrees C was much faster than the one at 37 degrees C. The SIN-TSL could be effectively taken up by lipopolysaccharide-activated HUVECs, without any cytotoxicity was observed. In addition, both in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that the SIN-TSL combined with microwave hyperthermia exhibited superior anti-rheumatoid arthritis effect. Overall, these results suggest that SIN-loaded thermosensitive liposomes combined with microwave hyperthermia could provide an optional strategy for alleviating the clinical symptoms of RA.

In this work, phosphorus removal and recovery from secondary effluent were achieved using municipal wastewaterderived materials as adsorbents. Through modification with 0.5 M NaOH for 30 min, iron containing sludge that originated from the coagulation pretreatment of municipal wastewater was successfully converted to phosphorus adsorbent. The maximal adsorption capacity of the prepared adsorbent was estimated to be 22 mg-P/g, and the adsorption performance remained stable in the pH range of 5-8. FeO(OH) was identified as the key adsorption site, and the ligand exchange mediated chemical adsorption was the main mechanism for phosphorus removal by the prepared material. Moreover, a laboratory-scale continuous-flow adsorption column experiment showed that the surplus phosphorus in secondary effluent could be readily reduced to <0.1 mg/L By pyrolysis of P-laden alkali-treated iron sludge under oxygen limited conditions, the phosphorus was recovered and successfully applied to support wheat growth. This work provides valuable information for both the sustainable management of phosphorus streams in wastewater and cyclic utilization of waste sludge. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It remains a significant challenge to capture and detect CTCs with high purity and sensitivity from blood samples. Herein, a nanoplatform is developed for the efficient isolation and ultrasensitive detection of CTCs by combining near-infrared (NIR) multivalent aptamer functionalized Ag2S nanodots with hybrid cell membrane-coated magnetic nanoparticles. Multivalent aptamer functionalized Ag2S nanodots are synthesized using a one-pot method under mild conditions (60 degrees C). White blood cell and tumor cell membranes are fused as the hybrid membrane and coated with magnetic nanoparticles, which are further modified with streptavidin (SA). Through the specific interaction of SA-biotin, the multivalent aptamer-Ag2S nanodots are grafted with hybrid cell membrane-magnetic nanoparticles. Due to the features of hybrid cell membrane modification, multivalent aptamer functionalization, magnetic separation, and NIR fluorescence measurements, the nanoplatform shows sensitive recognition, efficient capture, easy isolation, and sensitive detection of CTCs due to its great enhancement in anti-interference from background and improvement on binding ability toward CTCs. The capture efficiency and purity for CTCs is as high as 97.63% and 96.96%, respectively. Furthermore, the nanoplatform is successfully applied to the detection of CTCs in blood samples.

We used cultivated Taxus media trees for analyses of the chemical composition and protein of major stem tissues by an integrated metabolomic and proteomic approach, and the role of TmMYB3 in paclitaxel biosynthesis was investigated. The metabolomic landscape analysis showed differences in stem tissue-specific accumulation of metabolites. Phytochemical analysis revealed that there is high accumulation of paclitaxel in the phloem. Ten key enzymes involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis were identified, most of which are predominantly produced in the phloem. The full-length sequence of TmMYB3 and partial promoter sequences of five paclitaxel biosynthesis-related genes were isolated. Several MYB recognition elements were found in the promoters of TBT, DBTNBT and TS. Further in vitro and in vivo investigations indicated that TmMYB3 is involved in paclitaxel biosynthesis by activating the expression of TBT and TS. Differences in the taxoid composition of different stem tissues suggest that the whole stem of T. media has potential for biotechnological applications. Phloem-specific TmMYB3 plays a role in the transcriptional regulation of paclitaxel biosynthesis, and may explain the phloem-specific accumulation of paclitaxel.

J	Ren, ZM				Ren Zhuo-Ming			Node influence of the dynamic networks	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Review						growing networks; time-variant dynamic network; network perturbation; node influence	COMPLEX; IDENTIFICATION; CENTRALITY; SYSTEMS; SPREADERS; METRICS	Crucial to the physicists' strong interest in the field is the fact that such macroscopic properties typically arise as the result of a myriad of interactions between the system constituents. Network science aims at simplifying the study of a given complex system by representing it as a network, a collection of nodes and edges interconnecting them. Nowadays, it is widely recognized that some of the structural traits of networks are in fact ubiquitous properties in real systems. The identification and prediction of node influence are of great theoretical and practical significance to be known as a hot research field of complex networks. Most of current research advance is focused on static network or a snapshot of dynamic networks at a certain moment. However, in practical application scenarios, mostly complex networks extracted from society, biology, information, technology are evolving dynamically. Therefore, it is more meaningful to evaluate the node's influence in the dynamic network and predict the future influence of the node, especially before the change of the network structure. In this summary, we contribute on reviewing the improvement of node influence in dynamical networks, which involves three tasks: algorithmic complexity and time bias in growing networks; algorithmic applicability in time varying networks; algorithmic robustness in a dynamical network with small or sharp perturbation. Furthermore, we overview the framework of economic complexity based on dynamical network structure. Lastly, we point out the forefront as well as critical challenges of the field.

The target analytes were determined by ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Some crucial experimental parameters, such as type of adsorbents, amount of adsorbent, type of eluent solvents and adsorption capacity were investigated and optimized. Under the optimum extraction conditions, the enrichment factors of fenuron, monuron, diuron, linuron and pencycuron were 90, 128, 148, 204 and 295 times, respectively. A good linearity was obtained in different concentration levels of target analytes with the determination coefficients (r(2)) larger than 0.993. In addition, the limits of detection varied from 0.05 to 0.36 ng/mL and the recoveries of the analytes were in the range of 85.19-99.13 %. The results demonstrated that the proposed miniaturized solid-phase extraction procedure coupled with Zr-MOF could become an effective tool to analyze phenylurea herbicides and would have the vast application prospect for the extraction of pesticide residue and more organic pollutants from Hawthorn, Dendrobii Officinalis Caulis and Salviae Miltiorrhizae Radix et Rhizoma samples.

Development of an early-warning system for high-risk patients for suicide attempt using deep learning and electronic health records	TRANSLATIONAL PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							BEHAVIORS; INTERVENTIONS; PREVALENCE; THOUGHTS; ADULTS	Suicide is the tenth leading cause of death in the United States (US). An early-warning system (EWS) for suicide attempt could prove valuable for identifying those at risk of suicide attempts, and analyzing the contribution of repeated attempts to the risk of eventual death by suicide. In this study we sought to develop an EWS for high-risk suicide attempt patients through the development of a population-based risk stratification surveillance system. Advanced machine-learning algorithms and deep neural networks were utilized to build models with the data from electronic health records (EHRs). A final risk score was calculated for each individual and calibrated to indicate the probability of a suicide attempt in the following 1-year time period. Risk scores were subjected to individual-level analysis in order to aid in the interpretation of the results for health-care providers managing the at-risk cohorts. The 1-year suicide attempt risk model attained an area under the curve (AUC ROC) of 0.792 and 0.769 in the retrospective and prospective cohorts, respectively. The suicide attempt rate in the "very high risk" category was 60 times greater than the population baseline when tested in the prospective cohorts. Mental health disorders including depression, bipolar disorders and anxiety, along with substance abuse, impulse control disorders, clinical utilization indicators, and socioeconomic determinants were recognized as significant features associated with incident suicide attempt.

H2O2 enters cells through aquaporin membrane proteins and covalently modifies cytoplasmic proteins to regulate signalling and cellular processes. However, whether sensors for H2O2 also exist on the cell surface remains unknown. In plant cells, H2O2 triggers an influx of Ca2+ ions, which is thought to be involved in H2O2 sensing and signalling. Here, by using forward genetic screens based on Ca2+ imaging, we isolated hydrogen-peroxide-induced Ca(2+)increases (hpca) mutants in Arabidopsis, and identified HPCA1 as a leucine-rich-repeat receptor kinase belonging to a previously uncharacterized subfamily that features two extra pairs of cysteine residues in the extracellular domain. HPCA1 is localized to the plasma membrane and is activated by H2O2 via covalent modification of extracellular cysteine residues, which leads to autophosphorylation of HPCA1. HPCA1 mediates H2O2-induced activation of Ca2+ channels in guard cells and is required for stomatal closure. Our findings help to identify how the perception of extracellular H2O2 is integrated with responses to various external stresses and internal cues in plants, and have implications for the design of crops with enhanced fitness. HPCA1, a member of a previously uncharacterized subfamily of leucine-rich-repeat receptor-like kinases, is the hydrogen-peroxide sensor at the plasma membrane in Arabidopsis.

Magnetotransport and electronic structure of the antiferromagnetic semimetal YbAs	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							RANGE SPIN CORRELATIONS; PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES; MAGNETIC POLARON; TRANSPORT; SYSTEMS	A number of rare-earth monopnictides have topologically nontrivial band structures together with magnetism and strong electronic correlations. In order to examine whether the antiferromagnetic (AFM) semimetal YbAs (T-N = 0.5 K) exhibits such a scenario, we have grown high-quality single crystals using a flux method, and characterized the magnetic properties and electronic structure using specific heat, magnetotransport, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, together with density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Both ARPES and DFT calculations find no evidence for band inversions in YbAs, indicating a topologically trivial electronic structure. From low-temperature magnetotransport measurements, we map the field-temperature phase diagram, where we find the presence of a field stabilized phase distinct from the AFM phase at low temperatures. An extremely large magnetoresistance (XMR) for both YbAs and the nonmagnetic counterpart LuAs is also observed, which can consistently be accounted for by the presence of electron-hole compensation. Moreover, an angle-dependent study of the Shubnikov-de Haas effect oscillations reveals very similar Fermi surfaces between YbAs and LuAs, with light effective masses down to at least 0.5 K, indicating that the Yb-4 f electrons are well localized, and do not contribute to the Fermi surface. However, the influence of the localized Yb-4 f electrons on the magnetotransport of YbAs can be discerned from the distinct temperature dependence of the XMR compared to that of LuAs, which we attribute to the influence of short-ranged spin correlations that appear well above T-N.

Higher-frequency heart rate variability (HF-HRV) was found to be closely associated with self-compassion and pain coping. The current study was therefore designed to investigate the relationship between self-compassion and experimental pain as well as the impact of HF-HRV. Sixty healthy participants provided self-reported self-compassion and underwent a cold pain protocol during which HF-HRV was evaluated. Results demonstrated a dual relationship between self-compassion and pain, dependent on the level of HF-HRV during pain exposure. Specifically, self-compassion was associated with lower pain in the condition of higher HF-HRV, while there was an inverse relationship between self-compassion and pain when HF-HRV was lower. Our data indicate the significance of HF-HRV in moderating the association between self-compassion and experimental pain.

We present several characterizations for weak sharpness of the solutions set of nonsmooth variational inequalities without using the gap functions. We show that under weak sharpness of the solutions set, the sequence generated by proximal point methods terminates after a finite number of iterations. We also give an upper bound for the number of iterations for which the sequence generated by the exact proximal point methods terminates.

The present study examined the functional network connectivity in Chinese dyslexic children with resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) recordings. EEG data were recorded from 27 dyslexic children and 40 age-matched controls, and a minimum spanning tree (MST) analysis was performed to examine the network connectivity in the delta, theta, alpha, and beta frequency bands. The results show that, compared to age-matched controls, Chinese dyslexic children had global network deficiencies in the beta band, and the network topology was more path-like. Moderate correlations are observed between MST degree metric and rapid automatized naming and morphological awareness tests. These observations, together with the findings in alphabetic languages, show that brain network deficiency is a common neural underpinning of dyslexia across writing systems.

How the effectiveness or practicability of these rainfall partitioning algorithms when applied to model results is not well known. In this study, three convective-stratiform rainfall partitioning methods are compared and evaluated by analyzing cloud properties and associated precipitation budgets based on both observations and grid-scale simulations from a three-dimensional Weather Research and Forecasting modeling of Typhoon Fitow (2013). Results show that convective-stratiform rainfall separation based on surface rain rate is generally more reasonable than that based on radar reflectivity in terms of statistics of vertical velocity and raindrop microphysical budgets. The radar reflectivity partition method does not conduct an exact demarcation between convective and stratiform regions, since the rainfall in stratiform region has similar characteristics as convective rainfall, whereas the rainfall classified as convective rainfall has similar characteristics as stratiform rainfall. Observational analysis based on satellite and lightning confirms these results and shows that the rainfall separation based on surface rain rate generally detects the cellular convective rainfall near eyewall and isolated convection in spiral rainbands, whereas the rainfall separation based on radar reflectivity not only fails to identify the scattered convective rainfall but also overestimates the convective rainfall embedded among the stratiform regions. Above all, the method based on surface rainfall produces more reasonable statistical and microphysical characteristics for both convective and stratiform regions of precipitation, which generally agree with the real rainfall distributions from satellite and lightning observations.

In this study, high-performance g-C3N4/NiO heterojunctions were fabricated to degrade 2-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (2-CDD) under ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) light illumination. Experiments revealed that the pure g-C3N4 and range of g-C3N4/NiO heterojunctions were synthesized by the mixing and heating method, and then were characterized by XRD, TEM, XPS and PL etc. The composites exhibited enhanced dechlorination activities under anoxic conditions. After comparison, the g-C3N4/NiO (4:6) showed optimal dechlorination performance such that 70.4% of 2-CDD was removed within 8 h and 52.3% of 2-CDD was transformed to dibenzo-p-dioxin (DD), about fourfold higher than the pristine g-C3N4. The transformation of 2-CDD was accompanied by the resale of Cl ion, and the additional oxygen was proven to be able to consume electrons and hydrogen ions, thus greatly inhibiting the degradation of PCDD in systems. The g-C3N4/NiO (4:6) can be reused at least seven times, and the mechanism was proposed in detail to promote photoinduced electrohole separation and provide active sites. This study extends the use range of g-C3N4/NiO heterojunctions and develops a new technology to degrade PCDDs with striking activity and stability.

Methods Silylation of isomeric cresols was carried out by treatment with N-methyl-N-(trimethylsilyl)trifluoroacetamide. The formed trimethyl(tolyloxy)silanes were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Theoretical calculations were carried out with the Gaussian 03 program using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-311 + G(2d,p) level. Results The derivatives of three isomeric cresols and six isomeric xylenols have been completely separated on an HP-5MS capillary column within a GC run of only 10 minutes. In addition, the derivative o-cresol can be very easily differentiated from its isomers due to its characteristic base peak ion at m/z 91 in electron ionization (EI)-MS. DFT calculation results indicated that the formation of the abundant fragment ion at m/z 91 is attributed to a facile dissociation pathway involving the shift of a neighboring phenylmethyl hydrogen atom in EI-MS of trimethyl(o-tolyloxy)silane. Conclusions Silylation provides a promising solution for simultaneous determination of isomeric cresols and isomeric xylenols.

Although natural sunlight is the unlimited and clean energy on the earth, it is still a challenge to use sunlight to trigger shape changes of SMMs because sunlight is a relatively weak energy source. Herein, a type of natural sunlight-actuated SMMs with self-healing ability based on the carbon nanotubes/chlorinated poly(propylene carbonate) composites is fabricated by the facile melt blending. It is observed that the composites exhibit excellent shape memory properties, which can be triggered not only by IR light but also by sunlight. For pre-stretched composites with 200% strain, the contraction force produced during shape recovery under IR light is 2.6 +/- 0.2 N, which can lift 550 times their own weight. In addition, the shortest shape recovery time of the sheet composites (a thickness of 0.2 mm) under natural sunlight is only 39 s. Subsequently, the composite-paper bilayer films are constructed and assembled into an artificial flower. It is interesting to note that this flower can open under sunlight and close after blocking the sunlight, which is similar to the heliophile flowers in nature. Moreover, it is found that the incision on the composite sheet can be fast healed under infrared irradiation, which exhibits light-actuated self-healing behavior. We hope that this work may stimulate new ideas and inspire in the development of natural sunlight-actuated SMMs and devices in future.

In the developing central nervous system, this developmentally important transcription factor functions as a transcriptional repressor that governs oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelin gene expression, but the roles of various NKX2-2 structural domains in this process are unclear. In this study, using in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and coimmunoprecipitation, we determined the structural domains that mediate the repressive functions of murine NKX2-2 and identified the transcriptional corepressors that interact with it in OL cells. Through in ovo electroporation in embryonic chicken spinal cords, we demonstrate that the N-terminal Tinman domain and C-terminal domain synergistically promote OL differentiation by recruiting distinct transcriptional corepressors, including enhancer of split Groucho 3 (GRG3), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and DNA methyltransferase 3 ? (DNMT3A). We also observed that the NK2-specific domain suppresses the function of the C-terminal domain in OL differentiation. These findings delineate the distinct NKX2-2 domains and their roles in OL differentiation and suggest that NKX2-2 regulates differentiation by repressing gene expression via multiple cofactors and molecular mechanisms.

This study aimed to investigate the impact of canteen services on older adults' general mental health, nutritional status, satisfaction with life, and social capital in rural areas. Methods This study used a cross-sectional design. We selected 14 villages in Jinhua City, Zhejiang Province, China, including seven villages with canteen services and seven villages without canteen services. Participants were 284 senior older adults (aged 7598), including 140 residing in villages with canteen services (Canteen Group [CG]) and 144 residing in villages without canteen services (Non-Canteen Group [NCG]). We also divided the CG into two sub-groups according to the funding sources (one receiving government support only, the other receiving government support plus enterprise donations). We used a self-designed questionnaire, including sociodemographics, diet-related items (e.g., satisfaction with the meals, diet expenditure, self-evaluation of meal nutrition), and the four scales including the Chinese version of the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12), the Chinese version of the Mini Nutritional Assessment Short-Form (MNA-SF), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the Social Capital Questionnaire (SCQ). Results The overall mental health, satisfaction with life, and social capital of the CG were better than the NCG (P < 0.05). The nutritional status of these two groups did not show a significant difference. Participants in the CG with financial support from local government and donations from an enterprise with a better dietary diversity exhibited a better nutritional status (P < 0.05); the average satisfaction with diet and self-evaluation of food nutrition of the CG were higher than the NCG (P < 0.05); the ratio of having a diet on time in the CG was higher than that of the NCG (P < 0.05). Conclusion The free canteen services provided by the government can improve older adults' satisfaction with life and diet, and mental health status and also enrich their social capital, but this still needs to be future evidenced. More financial support for canteen services is an essential component in promoting successful aging in China.

The proliferation of OECs is necessary for the formation of the presumptive olfactory nerve layer (ONL) during development and OECs transplantation. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of OEC proliferation in the ONL still remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the role of sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) and S1P receptors (S1PRs) on OEC proliferation. Initially, reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), western blot and immunostaining revealed that S1PRs were highly expressed in the OECs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, we found that S1P treatment promoted the proliferation of primary cultured OECs mediated by S1PR1. Mechanistically, yes-associated protein (YAP) was required for S1P-induced OEC proliferation through RhoA signaling. Finally, conditional knockout of YAP in OECs reduced OEC proliferation in ONL, which impaired the axonal projection and growth of olfactory sensory neurons, and olfactory functions. Taken together, these results reveal a previously unrecognized function of S1P/RhoA/YAP pathway in the proliferation of OECs, contributing to the formation of ONL and the projection, growth, and function of olfactory sensory neurons during development.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for baryon and lepton number violating decays D+ -> (Lambda)over-bar((Sigma)over-bar(0))e(+) and D+ -> Lambda(Sigma(0))e(+)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							OPERATOR ANALYSIS	Using a 2.93 fb(-1) data sample of electron-positron collisions taken with the BESIII detector at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV, which corresponds to (8296 +/- 31 +/- 64) x 10(3) D+ D- pairs, we search for the baryon and lepton number violating decays D+ -> (Lambda) over bar((Sigma) over bar (0))e(+) and D+ -> Lambda(Sigma(0))e(+). No obvious signals are found with the current statistics and upper limits on the branching fractions of these four decays are set at the level of 10(-6) at 90% confidence level.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F.

To elucidate the effects of aggregate size on the potential loss of P-coll in agricultural systems, soils (0-20 cm depth) from six land-use types were sampled in the Zhejiang Province in the Yangtze River Delta region, China. The aggregate size fractions (2-8 mm, 0.26-2 mm, 0.053-0.26 mm and < 0.053 mm) were separated using the wet sieving method. Colloidal P and other soil parameters in aggregates were analyzed. Results Our study demonstrated that 0.26-2 mm small macroaggregates had the highest total P (TP) content. In acidic soils, the highest P-coll content was observed in the 0.26- to 2-mm-sized aggregates, while the lowest was reported in the < 0.053 mm (silt + clay)-sized particles, the opposite of that revealed in alkaline and neutral soils. Paddy soils contained less P-coll than other land-use types. The proportion of P-coll in total dissolved P (TDP) was dominated by < 0.053 mm (silt + clay)-sized particles. Aggregate size strongly influenced the loss potential of P-coll in paddy soils, where P-coll contributed up to 83% TDP in the silt + clay-sized particles. The P-coll content was positively correlated with TP, Al, Fe, and the mean weight diameter. Aggregate-associated total carbon (TC), total nitrogen (TN), C/P, and C/N had significant negative effects on the contribution of P-coll to potential soil P loss. The P-coll content of the aggregates was controlled by the aggregate-associated TP and Al content, as well as the soil pH value. The potential loss of P-coll from aggregates was controlled by its organic matter content. Conclusion We concluded that management practices that increase soil aggregate stability or its organic carbon content will limit P-coll loss in agricultural systems.

This thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect is dubbed the anomalous Nernst effect (ANE), and both of these effects are expected to scale with spontaneous magnetization. Here, we report the observation of a giant ANE in a newly discovered magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 crystal. The Hall effect and the Nernst effect show sharp jumps at a threshold field and exhibit a clear hysteresis loop below the Curie temperature T-C. The anomalous Nernst signal, S-yx(A), peaks at a maximum value of similar to 5 mu V /K, which is comparable to the largest seen in previous magnetic materials and seriously violates the conventional scale relation in conventional ferromagnets. Moreover, the anomalous transverse thermoelectric conductivity alpha(A)(yx), reaches about similar to 10 A/K m at 70 K, the largest in known semimetals. These results together with first-principles calculation provide strong evidence that the giant ANE originated from the nontrivial Berry curvature near the chiral Weyl points, which are very close to the Fermi level in this compound.

The main difficulty arises from the possible resonance behavior which may result in multiple solutions. We discover a new and interesting phenomenon showing that there exist infinitely many solutions for some certain initial data, which is quite different compared to earlier studies for the isentropic model of a fluid flow in a nozzle with variable cross-section and the shallow water equations with discontinuous topography. In order to overcome this difficulty, we impose the so-called TV-condition to obtain the uniqueness of solution to the Riemann problem.

Recently, the multipolar degrees of freedom have attracted remarkable attention in the electronic correlated effects. In this work, we systematically study the transport, magnetic, and thermodynamic properties of the topological semimetal candidate PrBi in the framework of crystalline electric field theory. Our results demonstrate the Gamma(3) non-Kramers doublet as the ground state of Pr3+ (4f(2)) ions. This ground state is nonmagnetic but carries a nonzero quadrupolar moment <(O) over cap (0)(2)>. A quadrupolar phase transition is inferred below 0.08 K. No obvious quadrupolar Kondo effect can be identified. Ultrahigh-field quantum oscillation measurements confirm PrBi as a semimetal with a nontrivial Berry phase and low total carrier density 0.06/f.u. We discuss the interplay between low carrier density and 4f(2) quadrupolar moment, and ascribe the weak quadrupolar ordering and Kondo effect to consequences of the low carrier density. PrBi, thus, opens a new window to the physics of topology and strongly correlated effects with quadrupolar degrees of freedom in the low-carrier-density limit, evoking the need for a reexamination of the Nozieres exhaustion problem in the context of the multichannel Kondo effect.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for the rare decay eta ' -> pi(0)pi(0)pi(0)pi(0) at BESIII	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a sample of 1.31 x 10(9) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector, we perform a search for the rare decay if eta' -> 4 pi(0) via J/psi -> gamma eta'. No significant eta' signal is observed in the 4 pi(0) invariant mass spectrum. With a Bayesian approach, the upper limit on the branching fraction is determined to be B(eta' -> 4 pi(0)) < 4.94 x 10(-5) at the 90% confidence level, which is a factor of 6 smaller than the previous experimental limit.

This study was to explore the association of noise kurtosis, triphosphopyridine nucleotide oxidase 3 (NOX3) and lifestyles with NIHL. Methods This case-control study included 307 patients with NIHL and 307 matched control individuals from Zhejiang province of China. General characteristics, noise exposure data, the exfoliated cells of the oral mucosa, and lifestyle details of individuals were collected. The kompetitive allele specific polymerase chain reaction (KASP) method was used to analyze the genotypes of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of NOX3. Results People who exposed to complex noise had a higher risk of NIHL than those exposed to steady noise (adjusted: OR = 1.806, P = 0.002). The GT genotype of additive model and TT + GT genotype of dominant model in NOX3 rs12195525 decreased the risk of NIHL (adjusted: OR = 0.618, P = 0.043; OR = 0.622, P = 0.036). Smoking and exposure to high video volume increased the risk of NIHL (adjusted: OR = 1.486, P = 0.038; OR = 1.611, P = 0.014). Oppositely, regular physical exercise decreased the risk of NIHL (adjusted: OR = 0.598, P = 0.004). A positive interaction was found between complex noise and lifestyles including high video volume exposure and no physical exercise in the additive models (RERI = 1.088, P < 0.001; RERI = 1.054, P = 0.024). A positive interaction was also found between NOX3 rs12195525 GG genotype and lifestyles including smoking and high video volume exposure in the additive models (RERI = 1.042, P = 0.005; RERI = 0.774, P = 0.044). Conclusions Noise temporal structure, NOX3 rs12195525 polymorphism, and the three lifestyles of smoking, video volume, and physical exercise were related to the NIHL. There were the interactions between noise temporal structure and the lifestyle of video volume or physical exercise, as well as between NOX3 and the lifestyle of smoking or video volume. These results provide a theoretical basis for the prevention and genetic testing of NIHL.

Because viral DNA polymerase lacks proofreading function (3' exonuclease activity), theoretically, the incorporated NAs would irreversibly terminate viral DNA synthesis. This study explored the natures of nascent hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA and infectivity of progeny virions produced under NA treatment. HBV infectivity was determined by infection of HepG2-NTCP cells and primary human hepatocytes (PHHs). Biochemical properties of HBV DNA in the progeny virions were investigated by qPCR, northern blotting, or Southern blotting hybridization, sucrose gradient centrifugation, and in vitro endogenous DNA polymerase assay. Progeny HBV virions produced under NA treatment were mainly not infectious to HepG2-NTCP cells or PHHs. Biochemical analysis revealed that under NA treatment, HBV DNA in nucleaocapsids or virions were predominantly short minus-strand DNA with irreversible termination. This finding was supported by the observation of first disappearance of relaxed circular DNA and then the proportional decline of HBV-DNA levels corresponding to the regions of PreC/C, S, and X genes in serial sera of patients receiving NA treatment. Conclusion: HBV virions produced under NA treatment are predominantly replication deficient because the viral genomes are truncated and elongation of DNA chains is irreversibly terminated. Clinically, our results suggest that the viral loads of CHB patients under NA therapy vary with the different regions of genome being detected by qPCR assays. Our findings also imply that NA prevention of perinatal and sexual HBV transmission as well as infection of transplanted livers works not only by reducing viral loads, but also by producing noninfectious virions.

We assess 17 network-based metrics by their ability to identify milestone papers and patents in three large citation datasets. We find that traditional information-retrieval evaluation metrics are strongly affected by the interplay between the age distribution of the milestone items and age biases of the evaluated metrics. Outcomes of these metrics are therefore not representative of the metrics' ranking ability. We argue in favor of a modified evaluation procedure that explicitly penalizes biased metrics and allows us to reveal metrics' performance patterns that are consistent across the datasets. PageRank and LeaderRank turn out to be the best-performing ranking metrics when their age bias is suppressed by a simple transformation of the scores that they produce, whereas other popular metrics, including citation count, HITS and Collective Influence, produce significantly worse ranking results.

However, clinical applications are limited for most AKR1B1 inhibitors due to adverse effects of cross-inhibition with other AKRs. Here, we report an atypical competitive binding and inhibitory effect of tolrestat on the thermostable AKR Tm1743 from Thermotoga maritima. Analysis of the Tm1743 crystal structure in complex with tolrestat alone and epalrestat-NADP+ shows that tolrestat, but not epalrestat, binding triggers dramatic conformational changes in the anionic site and cofactor binding pocket that prevents accommodation of NADP+. Enzymatic and molecular dynamics simulation analyses further confirm tolrestat as a competitive inhibitor of Tm1743.

We develop an Individualized Network-based Co-Mutation (INCM) methodology by inspecting over 2.5 million nonsynonymous somatic mutations derived from 6,789 tumor exomes across 14 cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Our INCM analysis reveals a higher genetic interaction burden on the significantly mutated genes, experimentally validated cancer genes, chromosome regulatory factors, and DNA damage repair genes, as compared to human pan-cancer essential genes identified by CRISPR-Cas9 screenings on 324 cancer cell lines. We find that genes involved in the cancer type-specific genetic subnetworks identified by INCM are significantly enriched in established cancer pathways, and the INCM-inferred putative genetic interactions are correlated with patient survival. By analyzing drug pharmacogenomics profiles from the Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer database, we show that the network-predicted putative genetic interactions (e.g., BRCA2-TP53) are significantly correlated with sensitivity/resistance of multiple therapeutic agents. We experimentally validated that afatinib has the strongest cytotoxic activity on BT474 (IC50 = 55.5 nM, BRCA2 and TP53 co-mutant) compared to MCF7 (IC50 = 7.7 mu M, both BRCA2 and TP53 wild type) and MDA-MB-231 (IC50 = 7.9 mu M, BRCA2 wild type but TP53 mutant). Finally, drug-target network analysis reveals several potential druggable genetic interactions by targeting tumor vulnerabilities. This study offers a powerful network-based methodology for identification of candidate therapeutic pathways that target tumor vulnerabilities and prioritization of potential pharmacogenomics biomarkers for development of personalized cancer medicine.

The influences of Nb-Mg doping level on structure, piezoelectricity and other electrical properties were systematically researched. The XRD, EDS and Raman scattering results confirmed that the doped Nb-Mg ions had successfully diffused into the crystal lattice of CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramic. Co-doping of Nb-Mg enhanced the piezoelectric coefficient d 33 effectively without causing significant deterioration on Curie temperature T-C. The CaBL4Ti3.9(Nb2/3Mg1/3)(0)O-.1(15) ceramic possessed the optimized electric properties with a high d(33) value of 24 pC/N accompanied by a high T-C value of 787 degrees C. In addition, this ceramic also exhibited a good thermal stability with d(33) keeping 91% of its original value after annealing M 600 degrees C. All these results suggested that Nb-Mg co-doped CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramic could be a potential candidate for high temperature piezoelectric sensor or detector applications.

OTS is thermally stable up to 573 K with vacuum annealing, whereas PTES starts decomposing at a moderate temperature between 373 K and 423 K. Vacuum annealing results in the decomposition of CF3 and CF2 species rather than desorption of the entire PTES molecule. In addition, our UPS results reveal that the work function (WF)of OTS remains the same after annealing; however WF of PTES decreases from similar to 5.62 eV to similar to 5.16 eV after annealing at 573 K.

J	Lou, DN; Wang, J; Wang, XH				Lou, Danning; Wang, Jun; Wang, Xiaohang			Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the non-coding region of STIM1 gene are associated with Parkinson disease risk in Chinese Han population	MEDICINE			English	Article						haploid; Parkinson disease; single nucleotide polymorphism; stromal interaction molecule 1	CA2+ SENSOR; CALCIUM; ACTIVATION; CHANNELS; STORE	The stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) gene contributes essentially to Ca2+ transport, thus it is functionally related to neurodegenerative disorders. The objective of this study was to investigate the correlation between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the non-coding region of STIM1 gene and the risk for Parkinson disease (PD) in a Chinese Han population. In a cohort composed of 300 PD patients and 300 healthy individuals from a Chinese Han population, we analyzed genotypes for five novel SNPs, rs7934581, rs3794050, rs1561876, rs3750994 and rs3750996 in the non-coding region of STIM1 gene. The levels of STIM1 protein in plasma of these subjects were also assessed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the SNPs of STIM1 gene rs7934581, rs3794050, rs1561876, and rs3750996 were associated with increased PD risk, while rs3750994 SNP was not. An increased risk of PD was observed in subjects with the TAAG and TGAG haplotypes of rs7934581, rs3794050, rs1561876, rs3750996. Moreover, PD risk was significantly elevated only in subjects with age =60 years or females who carry the STIM1 rs3794050 minor allele. There was a significant difference in plasma STIM1 protein levels between subjects with different genotypes of STIM1 rs7934581, rs3794050, rs1561876, and rs3750996. STIM1 gene rs7934581, rs3794050, rs1561876, rs3750996 SNPs are associated with increased PD risk, and its mechanism may be related to abnormal STIM1 gene expression.

Methods: The liposomes were prepared by ethanol injection and high-pressure micro-jet homogenization. Characterization of the liposomes was conducted, and drug content, entrapment efficiency (EE), in vitro release and stability were studied by ultra-fast liquid chromatography (MC) and a liquid surface method. Blood was drawn from rats to establish the pharmacokinetic parameters. The anticancer effect was evaluated in a KU-19-19 bladder cancer xenograft model. Histological analyses were performed to evaluate safety. Results: The PEG-Lipo-beta-E showed good stability and was characterized as 83.31 +/- 0.181 nm in size, 0.2791 0.004 in polydispersity index (PM), -21.4 +/- 1.06 mV in zeta potential, 6.65 ! 0.02 in pH, 5.024 +/- 0.107 mg/mL in beta-elemene (beta-E) content, and 95.53 +/- 1.712% in average EE. The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) indicated the formation of PEG-Lipo-beta-E. Compared to elemene injection, PEG-Lipo-beta-E demonstrated a 1.75-fold decrease in clearance, a 1.62-fold increase in half-life, and a 1.76-fold increase in area under the concentration-time curves (AUCs) from 0 hour to 1.5 hours (P < 0.05). PEG-Lipo-beta-E also showed an enhanced anticancer effect in vivo. Histological analyses showed that there was no evidence of toxicity to the heart, kidney, liver, lung or spleen. Conclusions:The present study demonstrates PEG-Lipo-beta-E as a new formulation with ease of preparation, high EE, good stability, improved bioavailability and antitumor effects.

Herein, a convenient and cost-effective route has been put forward to in situ synthesize nanolayered heterostructure based on N-doped TiO2 nanoparticles and N-doped carbon (N-TiO2/NC) using 2D layered N-MXene (N-Ti3C2Tx) as the template. The as-obtained N-TiO2/NC nanocomposite displays greatly enhanced visible light absorption property, superior carrier separation and transport ability. As a result, the nanolayered N-TiO2/NC heterostructure exhibits a satisfactory H-2 evolution rate from water-splitting (102.6 mu mol g(-1) h(-1)) under visible-light without any additional cocatalyst. The study provides a new strategy for the synthesis of defective nanoheterostructure and expands the applications of MXene family.

J	Zheng, H; Hu, BJ; Sun, Q; Cao, J; Liu, FM				Zheng, Hui; Hu, Binjing; Sun, Qiang; Cao, Jun; Liu, Fangmin			Applying a Chemical Structure Teaching Method in the Pharmaceutical Analysis Curriculum to Improve Student Engagement and Learning	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						Upper-Division Undergraduate; Collaborative/Cooperative Learning; Drugs/Pharmaceuticals; Curriculum	CHEMISTRY; KNOWLEDGE	Pharmaceutical analysis, as the core curriculum of chemistry, chemical engineering, and pharmaceutical engineering, contains broad and in-depth knowledge that leads to massive learning and teaching loads. There are more than 100 analytical methods of medicines in this course. As such, this subject is a big challenge for both students and lecturers. A novel chemical structure teaching (CST) method was developed on the basis of our long-term teaching experience to cope with these challenges. It has been shown in practice that this CST method can significantly unload the stress of students and lecturers simultaneously. The survey about the improvement of students' interests was carried out and listed in the form of questionnaire. The outcome of CST indicates that it can help students to form abilities of critical and logical thinking, motivate them to discuss with their peers and lecturers, and eventually improve comprehensive abilities such as synthesizing information, thinking logically, and analyzing problems independently as well as the average score. Furthermore, CST can be beneficial for lecturers who teach other relevant curricula in chemical or pharmaceutical engineering to improve the teaching outcome, such as organic chemistry, spectrum analysis, pharmaceutical synthesis, and medicinal chemistry. This CST model can also help students cultivate a life-long learning ability as active learners from the cognitive perspective view.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the direct effect of perceived social support and the mediation role of resilience on left-behind children's mental well-being. Data of 476 left-behind children in grades 4-9 from 6 schools were collected from a school-based project in Chuzhou District in mainland China. Structural equation modeling indicated that perceived social support elicited a significant direct effect on left-behind children's mental well-being. Resilience could partially mediate the influence of perceived social support on left-behind children's mental well-being. These findings could provide cross-cultural evidence for theoretical implications and contribute to evidence-based social policy and social work intervention to promote left-behind children's mental well-being.

Aims: The present study aimed to examine the mediating role of depression and the moderating roles of interpersonal relationships in the association between negative life events and MPD, in order to clarify the factors that intensify or abate MPD. Methods: We investigated 1505 left-behind adolescents from 11 junior middle schools in rural China, by using self-report questionnaires; The moderating mediation model and multi-group comparison were conducted by using SPSS 20.0 and Amos 17.0 software. Results: Negative life events had an indirect positive relation with MPD via depression; parent-child relationships group buffer the relation of negative life events with depression; peer relationships played a unique moderation role, as well as an interactive moderation role together with parent-child relationships in the relation between negative life events and MPD. Conclusions: Adverse experiences and emotions are risk factors for MPD in left-behind children; parent-child and peer relationships showed a reinforcement mode in buffering the negative associations between adverse experiences, emotions, and MPD.

NNK metabolic activation by cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) is a prerequisite to exerting its genotoxicity, but the metabolic regioselectivity and mechanism are still unknown. Here the binding feature and regioselectivity of CYPs 1A1, 1A2, 2A6, 2A13, 2B6, and 3A4 toward NNK are unraveled through molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Binding mode analyses reveal that 1A2 and 2B6 have definite preferences for NNK alpha-methyl hydroxylation, while the other four CYPs preferentially catalyze alpha-methylene hydroxylation. The binding affinities between NNK and CYPs evaluated by the binding free energies follow the order 2A13 > 2B6 > 1A2 > 2A6 > 1A1 > 3A4. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations are further performed to characterize the mechanism of NNK biotransformation. Results show that the alpha-hydroxyNNK generated from alpha-hydroxylation may undergo nonenzymatic decomposition to form genotoxic diazohydroxide and aldehyde, and further oxidation by P450 to yield nitrosamide, which mainly contributes to NNK toxification capacity. Meanwhile the pyridine N-oxidation and denitrosation of C-alpha-radical intermediate play an important role in detoxifying NNK. Overall, the present study provides the molecular basis for CYP-catalyzed regioselectivity and mechanism of NNK biotransformation, which can enable the identification of metabolites for assessing the health risk of individual NNK exposure.

In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanisms of persistent HIV infection and residual immune activation in HAART-treated patients. We showed that the expression level of B-cell CLL/lymphoma 11B (BCL11B) was significantly increased in CD4(+)T cells from HIV-infected patients undergoing HAART, and this was accompanied by increased expression of BCL11B-associated chromatin modifiers and inflammatory factors in comparison to healthy controls and untreated patients with HIV. In vitro assays showed that BCL11B significantly inhibited HIV-1 long terminal repeat (LTR)-mediated transcription. Knockdown of BCL11B resulted in the activation of HIV latent cells, and dissociation of BCL11B and its related chromatin remodeling factors from the HIV LTR. Our findings suggested that increased expression of BCL11B and its related chromatin modifiers contribute to HIV-1 transcriptional silencing, and alteration of BCL11B levels might lead to abnormal transcription and inflammation.

Increasing evidence suggests that a low-caloric diet might be a promising adjuvant therapeutic strategy for slowing or preventing the pathogenesis and progression of AD through the induction of autophagy. Several intracellular pathways have been implicated in caloric restriction (CR)-induced autophagy. In this review, we summarized the efficacy of CR as well as its mimetics (resveratrol, spermidine, aspirin, rapamycin, metformin, and curcumin) in improving cognitive function of rodent models of AD. On the basis of recent in vitro and animal studies, the beneficial effects of CR- or caloric restriction mimetics-induced autophagy in alleviating amyloid burden and tau pathology of AD were also discussed.

Optical absorption, cyclic voltammetry (CV), single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses and organic thin-film transistor (OTFT) were employed to investigate the structure-activity relationships of the resulting pyrrole derivatives. It was found that the introduction of a benzofuran unit enhances the planarity and conjugation of heteroacenes leading to strong molecular aggregation and denser pi-pi stacking, resulting in better charge transport properties with the hole mobility of 0.025 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1) for the OTFTs.

Therefore, an in-depth understanding about the growth mechanism of metal atoms on liquid substrates is both fundamentally interesting and technically important. Herein, we report the growth of zinc nanocrystals, including hexagonal nanoplates and one-dimensional nanowires, on an ionic liquid substrate without catalyst using thermal deposition method. The average height of terraced steps is similar to 18.6 nm with all steps height larger than 5.7 nm, corresponding to a critical value in determining the growth rate along [001] and [010] direction based on our theoretical calculations. Moreover, one-dimensional Zn nanowires can be also observed. The longest Zn nanowire can grow up to similar to 35.2 mu m. A theoretical model is then proposed to explain the formation of hexagonal zinc nanoplates and nanowires, qualitatively and quantitatively. The interaction force between gas Zn atoms and the as-grown Zn nanostructures along with the preferential growth direction are the main reasons for the formation of nanocrystalline structures. The adsorption energy of a gas Zn atom on multilayer crystal planes is calculated using the ATK program. In addition, the initial structure also affects the dimensions of the structures to some extent.

The simulation was conducted to optimize scan parameters. To validate the feasibility of the proposed technique, the visual and motor task experiments were performed at 7.0 Tesla (T). The single-shot EPI sequence was also applied in comparison with the proposed technique. The simulation results showed that an optimized flip angle of 9 degrees provided maximal BOLD contrast for our scanning scheme, allowing low power deposition and SMS acceleration factor of 5. Additionally, parallel acquisition imaging with acceleration factor of 2 was utilized, which allowed a total acceleration factor of 10 in volunteer study. The experiment results showed that geometric distortion-free BOLD images with voxel size of 1.0 x 1.0 x 2.5 mm(3) were obtained. Significant brain activation was identified in both visual and motor task experiments, which were in accordance with previous investigations. The proposed technique has potential for high spatial resolution fMRI at ultra-high field because of its sufficient BOLD sensitivity as well as improved acquisition speed over conventional GRE-based techniques.

The enhanced magnetic properties (B-r = 11.01 kG, H-cj = 15.5 kOe, and (BH)(max) = 30.1 MGOe) have been obtained with the slight Ce-doped (x = 0.1). The lower values of the corrosion potential E-corr and corrosion current density i(corr) for the Ce-doped magnet indicate that electrochemical corrosion rate of the Ce-doped magnet slows down and the corrosion resistance of the magnet is stronger. The microstructure results show that the Ce-doped magnet obtains a more uniform cellular structure with the smaller cell size and the homogeneous cell boundary phase, while the content of the Ce shows no observable difference between the cell and cell boundary.

The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon, highly related to the rapid urbanization, has attracted considerable attention from both academic scholars and governmental policymakers because of its direct influence on citizens' daily life. Land surface temperature (LST) is a widely used indicator to assess the intensity of UHI significantly affected by the local land use/cover (LULC). In this study, we used the Landsat time-series data to derive the LULC composition and LST distribution maps of Nanjing in 2000, 2014, and 2018. A correlation analysis was carried out to check the relationship between LST and the density of each class of LULC. We found out that cropland and forest in Nanjing are helping to cool the city with different degrees of cooling effects depending on the location and LULC composition. Then, a Cellar Automata (CA)-Markov model was applied to predict the LULC conditions of Nanjing in 2030 and 2050. Based on the simulated LULC maps and the relationship between LST and LULC, we delineated high- and moderate-LST related risk areas in the city of Nanjing. Our findings are valuable for the local government to reorganize the future development zones in a way to control the urban climate environment and to keep a healthy social life within the city.

To evaluate strategies that allow genotypes to be efficient under variable P environments, we planted six hybrid Populus deltoides clones belonging to the section Aigeiros (Aig), LL1, LL9, NL351, NL35, NL1388 and NL895, to three growth conditions in a greenhouse experiment, including low P, a high homogenous P supply and a high heterogeneous P supply. Functional traits, including foliar and root traits as well as rhizosphere processes, were measured. Large genotypic variation in shoot biomass and leaf P concentration was found in response to the P supply level and pattern. Compared with no P supply, LL1, LL9 and NL895 had a greater root length, biomass and P concentration in leaves under a homogenous P supply, while growth traits of NL351, NL35 and NL1388 were not significantly affected. A heterogeneous P supply enhanced the shoot biomass of LL1 and LL9. The root proliferation of LL1 and LL9 in P-rich patches was related to increased P acquisition in leaves. By contrast, a heterogeneous P supply did not enhance the biomass accumulation and the morphological plasticity of roots in other four genotypes, NL351, NL35, NL895 and NL1388, in P-rich patches. We found that functional traits or rhizosphere processes under low P could predict high P performance in Populus clones. Genotypes with a higher specific root length under low P can accumulate a larger biomass under a homogenous P supply. Conversely, high acid phosphatase concentrations decreased the positive impact of a heterogeneous P supply on a genotype's performance. Our results provide implications and applications for silviculture and forest management.

However, studies on the associations of internal assessments of metal exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are limited in scope and have inconsistent outcomes. Objectives: This investigation aimed to explore the associations between urinary nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), antimony (Sb), cobalt (Co), or vanadium (V) in early pregnancy and the subsequent risk of GDM in Chinese pregnant women. Methods: The study population included 2090 women with singleton pregnancy from the Tongji Maternal and Child Health Cohort (TMCHC). Urine samples were collected before 20 gestational weeks, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was conducted at 24-28 gestational weeks to diagnose GDM. The concentrations of urinary metals were measured using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and were corrected for urinary creatinine. The associations between the risk of GDM and urinary metals were assessed using Poisson regression with a robust error variance with generalized estimating equations (GEE) models and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR). Results: A total of 241 participants (11.53%) were diagnosed with GDM. Five metals (Ni, As, Sb, Co, and V) were found significantly and positively associated with GDM based on single-metal models. In multiple-metal models, for each unit increase of ln-transformed urinary Ni or Sb, the risk of GDM increased 18% [relative risk (RR):1.18, 95%confidence interval (CI): 1.00, 1.38 or RR: 1.18, 95%CI: 1.00, 1.39, respectively]. The BKMR analysis revealed a statistically significant and positive joint effect of the six metals on the risk of GDM, when the urinary levels of the six metals were all above the 55th percentile, compared to the median levels. The effect of metal Ni was significant when the concentrations of the other metals were all fixed at their 25th percentile, and metal Sb displayed a significant and positive effect when all the other metals were fixed at 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate that increased concentrations of urinary Ni in early pregnancy are associated with an elevated risk of GDM, either evaluated individually or as a metal mixture. All six metals mixed exposure was positively associated with the risk of GDM, while Sb and Ni were demonstrated more important effects than the other four metals in the mixture.

This study aimed to investigate the possible transplacental transfer mechanism of OCPs using an in vitro placental model. The results showed that for HCHs and DDXs, the placenta had a potential protection mechanism for the fetus by having higher efflux than intake active transport efficiency to transfer the xenobiotic out of the fetal circulation. No enantiomer-specific transport was observed for the chiral OCPs in vitro, hints simple diffusion played the major role in the transplacental transfer. Metabolic and transporter inhibitors were applied in the transepithelial transport experiment to evaluate the role that major transporting protein played in the active efflux process. The ATP production inhibitors were observed to have significant inhibition on transfer, proving the hypothesis that active transport participates in the transplacental transport of OCPs in humans. Multiple transporters contributed simultaneously in the active transport for the OCPs. In this study, we could confirm that the transplacental transfer of OCPs is a combination of simple diffusion and active transport. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily transporters on the placenta contribute in the active transport. These findings could improve the understanding of the mechanisms of transplacental transfer of the OCPs.

Small nucleolar RNA host gene 12 (SNHG12) was found to be upregulated and to act as an oncogene in several cancers. However, the function and regulatory mechanism of SNHG12 remain unclear in papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC). In this study, SNHG12 was found to be increased in PTC tissues and cell lines using quantitative real-time PCR. Knockdown of SNHG12 significantly inhibited PTC cell proliferation, migration and invasion and induced apoptosis in vitro. Mechanistic investigations revealed that SNHG12 functions as a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) to sponge miR-16-5p, which was downregulated in PTC tissues. In addition, rescue assays further confirmed that SNHG12 contributed to the progression of PTC through regulating miR-16-5p expression. These results indicated that SNHG12 might contribute to tumor progression in PTC by acting as a ceRNA to sponge miR-16-5p.

The complexes having one copper structure were fully characterized by NMR, ESI-MS and the single-crystal X-ray structures. Their photoelectric chemical properties were investigated by using cyclic voltammetry, UV/vis and fluorescence spectroscopy. Compared with the classic Cu((PP)-P-boolean AND)((NN)-N-boolean AND) complexes, this distorted tetrahedral coordination structure of Cu((PNNP)-N-boolean AND-N-boolean AND-P-boolean AND) complexes showed a wider excitation wavelength and a red-shifted about 100 nm emission peak, due to the link function between phenanthroline and phosphorus ligands. Moreover, the copper complex B having the naphthyl link groups displayed high red-emissive photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQY), which was up to 3.8%.

The number of terpyridyl units of these two compounds has a remarkable effect on the responses towards metal ions. DTPy-TPA with two terpyridyl groups on both sides displayed multi-response to Zn2+ and Cd2+ in THE solution along with distinct absorption and emission spectral changes, and obvious naked-eye color changes. However, TPy-TPA with one terpyridyl phenyl group didn't work. This should be resulted from the formation of supramolecular polymers or oligomers for DTPy-TPA to restrict the intramolecular motions, but dimers for TPy-TPA. Moreover, both of these two compounds in H2O/THF (9:1, v:v) solution could selectively and sensitively detect CN- with distinct fluorescence quenching, which was attributed to the nucleophilic addition of CN- to the alpha-position of the dicyanovinyl group and thus the free rotation of phenyl groups on TPA. The sensing mechanism of DTPy-TPA or TPy-TPA with CN- was confirmed by H-1 NMR titration and Job's plot. Finally, based on their excellent photophysical properties, these two probes were successfully employed to detect CN- in living HEK293 cells using fluorescence bioimaging.

Hatchling turtles from different incubation temperatures frequently exhibited diverse growth rates. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying this variation remain largely unclear. Here, we investigated the metabolic rate and feeding performance of hatchling Asian yellow pond turtles (Mauremys mutica) from eggs incubated at two different temperatures (26 and 30 degrees C) to evaluate the role of differences in metabolic expenditure, food intake and digestive efficiency on growth rate variation. Hatchlings from the cooler temperature had a greater growth rate and metabolic rate, tended to eat more food but showed a lower digestive efficiency of energy (DEE) than those from the warmer temperature. Accordingly, the difference in energy acquisition acts as a potential source for growth rate variation of hatchling turtles from different incubation temperatures, and increased energy intake (rather than enhanced digestive efficiency and reduced metabolic expenditure of other physiological processes) might be associated with the higher growth rate of cooler-incubated hatchling M. mutica.

In this study, we proposed a fast water filtering method, with a high salt rejection rate, that uses MoSe2 nanopore via molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. These simulation results suggest that fast water filtering and high salt rejection rates can be achieved using MoSe2 nanopore with a pore size of 66.54 angstrom(2). Water permeation through the MoSe2 nanopore is larger than that through the MoS2 nanopore of various size, and the water flux through both MoSe2 and MoS2 nanopores is much larger than that through the graphene nanopore of similar nanopore size. The underlying mechanism of water transportation through both MoSe2 and MoS2 nanopores are discussed after analysis of the water permeation potential of mean force (PMF), the 2D density of the water molecule inside the nanopores, the dipole of water molecules during transportation, etc. Our results suggest that a 1-cm(2) MoSe2 nanopore (66.54 angstrom(2)) membrane can produce freshwater with a flow rate of 10.1 L per day per MPa under 150 MPa, which it is about 2 orders of magnitude higher than the currently used commercial reverse osmosis (RO) membrane.

Different from the problem with Dirichlet boundary condition, the Green function of the Helmholtz equation with impedance boundary condition becomes very complicated and comprises surface waves along the locally perturbed line. A uniaxial perfectly matched layer (UPML) method is proposed to truncate the half plane into a bounded computational domain. The main contribution of this paper is to prove the well-posedness of the PML problem and the exponential convergence of the approximate solution to the exact solution as either the thickness or the medium parameter of PML increases.

J	Chen, QY; Liu, MY; Cao, C; He, Y				Chen, Qing-Yuan; Liu, Ming-yang; Cao, Chao; He, Yao			The effect of changing stacking patterns on electronic and optical properties of black phosphorus by strain:A computational study	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article							CHARGE-TRANSFER; GRAPHENE	The synergy effect on structural properties, electronic properties, and optical properties when changing strain and the number of layers at the same time of 2D black phosphorus (BP) are calculated in this paper by using first-principles calculations. The results show that with the number of the layer increased, the band-gap shows a decreasing trend, whereas the absorption edge shows a trend of red-shift. When we put different in-layer biaxial strain from -10% compressive strain (a/a(0) = 90%) to 10% tensile strain (a/a(0) = 110%) on all few-layer BP layers, the electronic, optical and structural properties change. In terms of electronic property, few-layer BP shows an increasing trend of the band-gap, and at the same time, a distinct change of chemical bond has been observed. As for the optical property, an anisotropic variation of the absorption and reflectivity occurs. And for the structural property, there is a noticeable regular anisotropic change of the stacking order. In our opinion, the increasing number of layers affects band splitting around the Gamma point and entire BZ, which leads to the decrease of the gap. The changing of the layer from 5 L to 1L and the strain from -10% compressive strain to 10% tensile strain affect the stacking order and the change of near-band-states of few-layer BP, which further impacts the band-gap, chemical bond and its transition from metal to semiconductor of BP. Besides, the strain effect leads to the anisotropic change of the structure, which further results in the anisotropic change in the optical properties of the few-layer BP. This study implies that we can alter the function of the few-layer material by setting up the suitable strain and the number of the layer in the future.

To examine the linkages among the three aspects of academic engagement, a sample of 789 Chinese primary school students (47% girls; 39% 3rd graders, 31% 4th graders, 30% 5th graders) completed the Mathematics Engagement Scale at three 6-month intervals over the course of 1.5 years. Results indicated that the effects of behavioural, cognitive, and emotional engagement amplified and influenced one another over time. Specifically, behavioural engagement stably predicted cognitive and emotional engagement over time, but the prediction of cognitive engagement on emotional engagement was not consistent from T1 to T2 and from T2 to T3. In addition, emotional engagement significantly predicted behavioural and cognitive engagement only from T2 to T3. These findings support academic engagement as multidimensional construct and advance the understanding of its internal dynamical and continuous developmental interrelations.

In vitro TPGS1000 significantly inhibited the viability and mobility of HCC cells (HepG2, Hep3B and Huh7) in a dose-dependent manner. Cell cycle analysis indicated that TPGS1000 treatment arrested the HCC cell cycle in the G0/G1 phase, and induction of cell apoptosis was confirmed by TUNEL and Annexin V-7-AAD staining. Further pharmacological analysis indicated that collapse of the transmembrane potential of mitochondria, increased ROS generation, PARP-induced cell apoptosis and FoxM1-p21-mediated cell cycle arresting, were involved in the anti-HCC activity of TPGS1000. Moreover, treatment in vivo with TPGS1000 effectively impaired the growth of HCC xenografts in nude mice.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of Proton Electromagnetic Form Factors in e(+) e(-) -> p(p)over-bar in the Energy Region 2.00-3.08 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							ANNIHILATION	The process of e(+)e(-) -> p (p) over bar is studied at 22 center-of-mass energy points (root s) from 2.00 to 3.08 GeV, exploiting 688.5 pb(-1) of data collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII collider. The Born cross section (sigma(p (p) over bar)) of e(+)e(-) -> p (p) over bar is measured with the energy-scan technique and it is found to be consistent with previously published data, but with much improved accuracy. In addition, the electro-magnetic form-factor ratio (vertical bar G(E)/G(M)vertical bar) and the value of the effective (vertical bar G(eff)vertical bar), electric (vertical bar G(E)vertical bar), and magnetic (vertical bar G(M)vertical bar) form factors are measured by studying the helicity angle of the proton at 16 center-of-mass energy points. vertical bar G(E)/G(M)vertical bar and vertical bar G(M)vertical bar are determined with high accuracy, providing uncertainties comparable to data in the spacelike region, and vertical bar G(E)vertical bar is measured for the first time. We reach unprecedented accuracy, and precision results in the timelike region provide information to improve our understanding of the proton inner structure and to test theoretical models which depend on nonperturbative quantum chromodynamics.

Herein we report the impact of MoO3 surface functionalization on the photoresponse of epitaxially grown ZnO. Under illumination with 350 nm UV light, the photocurrent of ZnO is found to be enhanced by 2.87 times after the deposition of 0.2 nm MoO3. As corroborated by in situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy results, the enhanced photoresponse derives from MoO3 related gap states within the band gap of ZnO and larger upward band bending at the interface, which is attributed to the strong electron transfer from ZnO to MoO3. Moreover, photoluminescence results reveal that the recombination probability of the photo-generated charge carriers in ZnO is reduced after MoO3 surface functionalization.

In this study, a Pd(ii) Schiff base complex is fixed on FeNi3/DFNS nanoparticles and then reacted with melamine to provide a recoverable magnetic heterogeneous nanocomposite of FeNi3/DFNS/salen/Pd(ii). It was determined that the FeNi3/DFNS nanoparticles are an appropriate catalyst for the oxidation carboxylation of styrenes with CO2 in a one-step reaction. The FeNi3/DFNS nanoparticles were characterized via XPS, FTIR, EDX, FE-SEM, XRD, TGA, TEM, IC, VSM and BET analyses. The important benefits of this catalyst are its easy work-up, low cost and high efficiency.

In this work, a convenient nitriding-pretreatment route has been applied to engineer the C vacancy defects in Ti3C2Tx MXene, which often results in the structural instability. Based on the above defect engineering, the 2D skeleton is maintained in the following Ti3C2Tx oxidation for the formation of TiO2 and carbon layers. Successfully, a "from 2D to 2D" structure and functional transformation is realized and TiO2 nanoplates are in-situ grown between carbon layers, which greatly boost photogenerated carrier's separation and electron's transmission. As a result, this TiO2/C superstructure exhibits an efficient photocatalytic ability in water-splitting process under visible light without any cocatalyst (87.2 mu mol g(-1)h(-1) 28.1 times of disordered TiO2/C sample). The defect engineering for MXene provides a new strategy for the highly orderly layer-by-layer superstructure.

However, only a few studies have reported the early degeneration in the distal CST during the acute stage of stroke and pathological changes in the distal CST have not been described. Purpose: To study the microstructural changes along the CST beyond the ischemic lesion in acute stroke using diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI). Study Type: Prospective. Population: In all, 48 patients (26 males, 22 females; mean age 58.27 +/- 12.89 years) with acute ischemic stroke. Sequence: A DKI sequence with three b-values (0, 1000, and 2000 s/mm(2)) at 3.0T MRI. Assessment: The kurtosis and tensor parameters were derived from DKI and were compared along the length of the CST beyond the ischemic lesion between the affected and unaffected hemispheres using both voxelwise and slicewise analysis. The degree of neurological deficits was evaluated using the National Institute of Health Stroke Score (NIHSS) and the Barthel index and the clinical outcome at 3 months was evaluated using a modified Rankin scale. Statistical Tests: Paired t-tests, a linear mixed model, and multivariate linear regression. Results: Voxelwise analysis demonstrated increased mean kurtosis, increased axial kurtosis, and decreased axial diffusivity in the affected CST, which were seen only at the level of the cerebral peduncle (all corrected P <0.05). Slicewise analysis also demonstrated increased axial kurtosis in the cerebral peduncle of the affected CST (corrected P <0.05). The axial kurtosis from slicewise analysis independently correlated with the motor component of NIHSS (beta = 0.297, P = 0.040). Data Conclusion: Our findings suggest that early anterograde degeneration occurs along the axon direction in the distal CST in acute stroke, and can be detected using DKI. Moreover, acute axonal degeneration along the CST correlated with motor deficits.

As a potential DNA carrier, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have been extensively studied due to its unique properties. However, the mechanism of DNA translocation with CNTs through cell membrane is still not well understood. In this study, the DNA translocation process through POPC (1-palmitoyl-2-oleoylphosphatidylcholine) membrane with the assistance of CNTs was explored by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Our simulation results demonstrated that the CNTs could insert steadily into the POPC membrane, and DNA molecules tends to insert into the inner space of CNTs. With the assistance of CNTs, the free energy of nucleotides passing through the POPC membrane decreases. Moreover, the free energy of nucleotides (DA (deoxyadenosine), DT (deoxythymidine), DC (deoxycytidine), and DG (deoxyguanosine)) passing through POPC membrane follows the order: DA (deoxyadenosine) > DG (deoxyguanosine) > DC (deoxycytidine) > DT (deoxythymidine). These results may promote the design and application of CNT-based gene delivery system.

In the present study, we showed that microRNA (miR)-127 played a key role in controlling bacterial infection and conferred a profound protection against staphylococcal pneumonia. The protective effect of miR-127 was largely dependent on its regulation of macrophage bactericidal activity and the generation of IL-22, IL-17, and anti-microbial peptides (AMPs), the pathway primarily driven by STAT3. Importantly, we revealed that the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20, a genuine target of miR-127, specifically interacted with and repressed K63-ubiquitination of STAT3, thereby compromising its phosphorylation upon bacterial infection. Thus, our data not only identify miR-127 as a non-coding molecule with anti-bacterial activity but also delineate an unappreciated mechanism whereby A20 regulates STAT3-driven anti-microbial signaling via modulating its ubiquitination.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of the decays chi(cJ) -> phi phi eta	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							RADIATIVE DECAYS	Using a data sample of (448.1 +/- 2.9) x 10( )(6)psi(3686) decays collected by the BESIII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider (BEPCII), we observe the decays chi(cJ) -> phi phi eta (J = 0, 1, 2), where the chi(cJ) are produced via the radiative processes psi(3686) -> gamma chi(cJ) . The branching fractions are measured to be B(chi(c0) -> phi phi eta) = (8.41 +/- 0.74 +/- 0.62) x 10(-4), B(chi(c1) -> phi phi eta) = (2.96 +/- 0.43 +/- 0.22) x 10(-4), and B( chi(c2) -> phi phi eta) = (5.33 +/- 0.52 +/- 0.39) x 10(-4), where the first uncertainties are statistical, and the second are systematic. We also search for intermediate states in the phi phi or eta phi subsystems, but no significant structure is seen due to the limited statistics.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Cai, X.; Cao, G.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of the Cross Section for e(+)e(-) -> Xi(-)Xi(+)and Observation of an Excited Xi Baryon	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							RELATIVIZED QUARK-MODEL; CONSTRUCTION; RESONANCES	Using a total of 11.0 fb(-1) of e(+)e(-) collision data with center-of-mass energies between 4.009 and 4.6 GeV and collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, we measure fifteen exclusive cross sections and effective form factors for the process e(+)e(-) -> Xi(-)Xi(+) by means of a single baryon-tag method. After performing a fit to the dressed cross section of e(+)e(-)-> Xi(-)Xi(+) no significant psi(4230) or psi(4260) resonance is observed in the Xi(-)Xi(+) final states, and upper limits at the 90% confidence level on T B-ee for the processes psi(4230)psi/(4260) -> Xi(-)Xi(+) are determined. In addition, an excited Xi baryon at 1820 MeV/c(2) is observed with a statistical significance of 6.2-6.5 sigma by including the systematic uncertainty, and the mass and width are measured to be M = (1825.5 +/- 4.7 +/- 4.7) MeV/c(2) and Gamma = (17.0 +/- 15.0 +/- 7.9) MeV, which confirms the existence of the J(P) =3-/2 state Xi (1820).

Telomere G4 stabilization prevents telomere lengthening by telomerase in cancer cells representing a promising strategy in cancer therapy. Using molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, specific binding of the anionic phthalocyanine 3,4MODIFIER LETTER PRIME,4MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEMODIFIER LETTER PRIME,4MODIFIER LETTER PRIMEMODIFIER LETTER PRIMEMODIFIER LETTER PRIME-tetrasulfonic acid (APC) to the human hybrid (3 + 1) G4s was investigated at the atomic level. We found that APC preferred the end-stacking binding with the telomere hybrid type II (hybrid-II) G4 as compared to the groove binding with the hybrid type I (hybrid-I) G4 remarkable stabilizing effect and more favourable binding free energies. Analysis of non-covalent interaction and decomposition of the binding free energy revealed that van der Waals interaction played a leading role in the binding of APC and telomere hybrid G4s. These findings provide evidence for the first time to shed light on the designs of selective telomere G4 stabilizers.

In this study, we explored the potential function of phosphoglucomutase (PGM) using RNA interference technology in Nilaparvata lugens, the brown planthopper. PGM1 and PGM2 were found highly expressed in the midgut of brown planthoppers, with different expression levels in different instar nymphs. The glycogen, glucose, and trehalose levels were also significantly increased after brown planthoppers were injected with dsRNA targeting PGM1 (dsPGM1) or PGM2 (dsPGM2). In addition, injection of dsPGM1 or dsPGM2 resulted in increased membrane-bound trehalase activity but not soluble trehalase activity. Furthermore, the expression of genes related to trehalose and glycogen metabolism decreased significantly after injection with dsPGM1 and dsPGM2. The expression levels of genes involved in chitin metabolism in the brown planthopper were also significantly decreased and the insects showed wing deformities and difficulty molting following RNAi. We suggest that silencing of PGM1 and PGM2 expression directly inhibits trehalose metabolism, leading to impaired chitin synthesis.

TlCo2S2 and TlCo1.97Ni0.03S2 are ferromagnetically ordered below 153 K and 142 K with saturated moment 0.82 /Co and 0.80 /Co, respectively, while TlCo1.95Ni0.05S2 shows ferromagnetic transition at 132 K. The magnetism displays slightly itinerant character, as inferred from the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio. An unusual historical dependence of magnetization in TlCo1.95Ni0.05S2 is consistently observed by scanning both the temperature and magnetic field. The isothermal magnetic entropy change ( S) of TlCo2S2 and TlCo1.95Ni0.05S2 are calculated by Maxwell relation and a temperature averaged entropy change is adopted to estimate the figure of merit for the compounds.

The GHZ states of the N-group qubits are generated by using N-group qutrits placed in the N cavities. Here, "qutrit" refers to a three-level quantum system with the two lowest levels representing a qubit while the third level acting as an intermediate state necessary for the GHZ state creation. This proposal does not depend on the architecture of the cavity-based quantum network and the way for coupling the cavities. The operation time is independent of the number of qubits. The GHZ states are prepared deterministically because no measurement on the states of qutrits or cavities is needed. In addition, the third energy level of the qutrits during the entire operation is virtually excited and thus decoherence from higher energy levels is greatly suppressed. This proposal is quite general and can in principle be applied to create GHZ states of many qubits using different types of physical qutrits (e.g., atoms, quantum dots, NV centers, various superconducting qutrits, etc.) distributed in multiple cavities. As a specific example, we further discuss the experimental feasibility of preparing a GHZ state of four-group transmon qubits (each group consisting of three qubits) distributed in four one-dimensional transmission line resonators arranged in an array.

BESIII Collaboration	Cross section measurement of e(+) e(-) -> eta ' J/psi from root S=4.178 to 4.600 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The cross section of the process e(+) e(-) -> eta ' J/ psi is measured at center-of-mass (c.m.) energies from root S = 4.178 to 4.600 GeV using data samples corresponding to a total integrated luminosity of 11 fb(-1) collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. The dependence of the cross section on root S shows an enhancement around 4.2 GeV. While the shape of the cross section cannot be fully explained with a single psi(4160) or psi(4260) state, a coherent sum of the two states does provide a reasonable description of the data.

J	Chen, JW; Zhu, YT; Jiang, W				Chen, Jianwen; Zhu, Yutian; Jiang, Wei			A stretchable and transparent strain sensor based on sandwich-like PDMS/CNTs/PDMS composite containing an ultrathin conductive CNT layer	COMPOSITES SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Conductive polymer composites (CPCs); Strain sensing behaviors; Optical transparency	CONTINUOUS POLYMER BLEND; CARBON NANOTUBES; PIEZORESISTIVE BEHAVIOR; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; SENSING BEHAVIORS; NANOCOMPOSITES; DESIGN; SENSITIVITY; NETWORK; PERFORMANCE	Stretchable and transparent strain sensors based on conductive polymer composites (CPCs) possess potential applications in a variety of fields, including electronic skin, wearable electronics, and human motion detection. However, it is still a challenge to prepare CPC-based strain sensors with both good transparency and broad sensing range by a low-cost, facile, and scalable fabrication method. Herein, we report a simple spray deposition and transfer method to fabricate a stretchable and transparent strain sensor based on the sandwich-like poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS)/carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/PDMS composite containing with an ultrathin and uniform conductive layer. The fabricated strain sensors exhibit superb stretchability, good optical transparency, and excellent sensing performances, which can detect both the subtle and large strains with outstanding stability and repeatability. For example, the strain sensor based on PDMS/CNTs/PDMS composite (containing 0.16 mg/cm(2) CNTs on the conductive layer) presents a good optical transmittance of 53.1% at 550 nm, broad sensing range of over 130%, and the ability to monitor both the subtle motions of facial expressions and the large motions of human joints, which has great potential applications in human motion detection, wearable electronics, and electronic skin.

Based on a comparison of the type specimens for Carex purpureotincta, C. haematorrhyncha (C. purpureotincta var. sphaerocarpa), C. xiangxiensis and C. retrofracta, and an analysis of morphological and molecular variation within and among populations, we could not find consistent diagnostic characters to differentiate all four of these putative species. Consequently, all of these taxa are considered to be conspecific and reduced to synonym of Carex retrofracta, the oldest name among them, expanding the distribution of this species to the provinces of Anhui, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Sichuan, Taiwan and Zhejiang. Populations from southern Hunan and northern Guangxi were found to be distinct from the other samples of Carex retrofracta in both morphological and molecular data, and are described here as a new subspecies, which differs from C. retrofracta in having glabrous leaves and shorter perigynia.

Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) is critical for steady-state number and differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), but its downstream targets are unclear. Here, we show for the first time that Gab1, an adaptor protein of receptor tyrosine kinase, is specifically expressed in OL lineage cells and is an essential effector of PDGF signaling in OPCs in mice. Gab1 is downregulated by PDGF stimulation and upregulated during OPC differentiation. Conditional deletions of Gab1 in OLs cause CNS hypomyelination by affecting OPC differentiation. Moreover, Gab1 binds to downstream GSK3 beta and regulated its activity, and thereby affects the nuclear accumulation of beta-catenin and the expression of a number of transcription factors critical to myelination. Our work uncovers a novel downstream target of PDGF signaling, which is essential to OPC differentiation and CNS myelination.

We perform systematical calculations in DL hydrogenated bismuthene (H-Bi) that can be used to simulate the experimentally grown planar bismuthene to explore realizable 2D topological insulator van der Waals DL. Two possible geometry configurations of AA- and AB-stacked DL H-Bi are investigated. Due to pseudo Jahn-Teller effect, AB-stacked DL H-Bi has a strong interlayer coupling interaction and shows buckled lattice. Particularly, both AA- and AB-stacked DL H-Bi are topologically trivial rather than topologically nontrivial. The physical origin of the trivial topology is clarified by analyzing orbital composition. We discuss how the electronic properties are modified by interlayer coupling, external strain, and metal atom intercalation. It is also found that, for AB-stacked DL H-Bi, metal atom intercalation gives rise to novel multiple Rashba splitting near the valence band top, which is expected to manipulate the same spin in different planar bismuthene layers. Our results present various and tunable electronic properties of van der Waals DL H-Bi and allow for probing into multiple Rashba effect in 2D inversion-asymmetric topological insulators.

However, the mechanisms by which telomerase is reactivated or upregulated during tumorigenesis remain incompletely understood. Here, we report that the Hippo pathway effector Yes-associated protein (YAP) regulates the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT). Ectopic expression or physiological activation of YAP increases hTERT expression, whereas knockdown of YAP decreases the expression of hTERT. YAP binds to the hTERT promoter through interaction with the TEA domain family transcription factors and activates hTERT transcription. Furthermore, sustained YAP hyperactivation promotes telomerase activity and extends telomere length, with increased hTERT expression. In addition, we show that hTERT expression is positively correlated with YAP activation in human liver cancer tissues. Together, our results demonstrate that YAP promotes hTERT expression, which could contribute to tumor progression.

This compound is stable and practical for use as a reagent. Various primary, secondary. and tertiary alkyl-Bpin and aryl-Bpin substrates were aminated to give the corresponding amine derivatives. The amination is stereospecific. The anti-Markovnikov hydroamination of olefins was easily achieved by catalytic hydroboration with HBpin and in subsequent situ amination using H2N-DABCO. Moreover, the combination of 1,2-diboration of olefins, using B(2)pin(2), with this amination process achieved the unprecedented 1,2-diamination of olefins. The amination protocol was also successfully extended to aryl pinacol boronates.

Bufotalin, an active constituent of Bufadienolides, exerts potent antitumor effects with unknown effects on autoimmune diseases including SS. This study aims to investigate whether bufotalin possesses therapeutic potentials to SS and the underlying mechanisms. The experimental Sjogren's syndrome (ESS) murine model was constructed by SG-immunization and murine naive CD4(+) T cells were cultured under Th17 polarization conditions with or without low doses of bufotalin treatment. Saliva flow rate was measured, and flow cytometry was applied to analyze T cell subpopulations. ELISA was conducted to determine the levels of targeted inflammatory cytokines. Bufotalin-treated ESS mice showed higher saliva flow rates, lower serum levels of autoantibodies (anti-M3R and anti-SSA IgG), lower serum levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as lower Th17 cell population from spleens and cervical lymph nodes. Additionally, in vitro study showed that bufotalin inhibits Th17 polarization and secretion of cytokines IL-17 and IFN-gamma. Bufotalin at a low dose significantly ameliorates ESS development, possibly via inhibiting pro-inflammatory Th17 population and secretion of inflammatory cytokines during ESS pathogenesis.

The compatibilization efficiency is found to be dictated by the thermodynamic interactions between PMMA-type compatibilizers and ABS materials. For one type of ABS, which is composed of methyl methacrylate (MMA), styrene (St), acrylonitrile (AN), and butadiene (BD), the MMA component of ABS is able to strengthen the interaction between the PMMA-type compatibilizers and the ABS phase and thus the obtained compatibilized PLLA/ABS blends display a fine cocontinuous morphology and excellent mechanical properties. For the other two ABS materials, which are constituted by St, AN, and BD, it has been found that the PMMA-type compatibilizers are pulled out from the interface to form micelles in the PLLA phase, on account of the weakening interactions between ABS and PMMA-type compatibilizers.

For this purpose, aldehyde ketone reductase (AKR) was used as a model enzyme, and 110Y, 114Y, 143Y, 162Q and 189Q were each replaced with p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF). Then, the mutant AKR was coupled to the functionalized support by strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition (SPAAC). The effects of the incorporation number and site of NSAAs on the loading and thermal stability of the immobilized AKR were examined. The results show that the mutant enzymes presented better specific activity than the wild type, except for AKR-110Y, and AKR-114Y showed 1.16-fold higher activity than the wild type. Moreover, the half-life (t(1/2)) of the five-point immobilized AKR reached 106 h and 45 h, 13 and 7 times higher than that of the free enzyme at 30 degrees C and 60 degrees C, respectively. Comparison of these three types of enzymes shows that multi-point immobilization provides improved loading and thermal stability and facilitates one-step purification. We expect this platform to facilitate a fundamental understanding of precisely oriented and controllable covalent immobilization and enable bio-manufacturing paradigms for fine chemicals and pharmaceuticals.

Abnormal PRPF3 expression is potentially associated with carcinogenesis. However, the biological role of PRPF3 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains to be determined. We analyzed PRPF3 expression via multiple gene expression databases and identified its genetic alterations and functional networks using cBioPortal. Co-expressed genes with PRPF3 and its regulators were identified using LinkedOmics. The correlations between PRPF3 and cancer immune infiltrates were investigated via Tumor Immune Estimation Resource (TIMER). PRPF3 was found up-regulated with amplification in tumor tissues in multiple HCC cohorts. High PRPF3 expression was associated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS). Functional network analysis suggested that PRPF3 regulates spliceosome, DNA replication, and cell cycle signaling via pathways involving several cancer-related kinases and E2F family. Notably, PRPF3 expression was positively correlated with infiltrating levels of CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. PRPF3 expression showed strong correlations with diverse immune marker sets in HCC. These findings suggest that PRPF3 is correlated with prognosis and immune infiltrating in HCC, laying a foundation for further study of the immune regulatory role of PRPF3 in HCC.

However, few studies have analyzed how these historical degradation trends will continue into the future, especially in rapidly developing regions. Here, we quantified the long-term wetland degradation from 1984 to 2016 in Hangzhou Bay and then developed land use simulation models to predict the spatial locations of wetland degradation to 2046 under different scenarios. Key findings include the following: (a) there was a statistically significant decreasing trend for the natural wetlands of ~10 km(2) yr(-1) on average from 1984 to 2016; (b) after the establishment of an economic development zone in 2001, the degradation rate more than quadrupled, accelerating from ~4 to ~18 km(2) yr(-1); and (c) if the high degradation rate continues (the economic development scenario), then the coastline will move approximately 5.89 km inland, significantly undermining the protections against sea level rise. In contrast, in the wetland protection scenarios, the projected degradation could be mitigated by ~20%. The proposed framework to reveal the key historical drivers of degradation and potential future protection strategies of wetlands provides much needed insights and tools for protection of other coastal wetlands undergoing rapid development.

Conductive polymer composites (CPCs) have been utilized to fabricate strain sensors owing to their lightweight and high flexibility. It is a great challenge to develop flexible and wearable strain sensors with light weight, good skin affinity and gas permeability, high sensitivity and excellent corrosion resistance. In this work, electrospun thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) nanofibers were first decorated by graphene through ultra-sonication, followed by polydopamine (PDA) modification and then hydrophobic treatment with 1H, 1H, 2H, 2H-perfluorodecanethiol (PFDT). The obtained electrical conductive polymer nanofiber composites (CPNCs) have a hierarchical polymer core/graphene shell structure and exhibit super-hydrophobicity even under harsh environments. The introduction of PDA not only improves the interfacial interaction between individual graphene sheets but also the interaction between graphene and the TPU nanofibers. Their mechanical properties including Young's modulus, tensile strength and elongation at break are significantly improved, compared to those of TPU nano-fibrous membranes. When CPNC is used as a strain sensor, it displays high stretchability, controllable sensitivity, excellent cyclical stability and durability. Hence, the nanofiber composite based strain sensor can be attached on the skin for precise monitoring of different human motions, such as tiny and large body movements and thus has promising applications in wearable devices.

In particular, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) material has become the focus of current research due to its unique properties and advantages. An in-depth understanding of the interfacial interaction between materials and biomolecules is critical in biomedical field. Therefore, the directional selection of double-stranded DNA (ds-DNA) on the MoS2 surface was studied by molecular dynamics (MD) simulation in this work. The simulation results showed that double-strand DNA (ds-DNA) was vertically adsorbed on the MoS2 surface through terminal bases, and the main driving forces is Van der Waals force. In addition, our results indicate that the length and base sequence of ds-DNA are independent of its selection of vertically adsorbed orientation, which may be beneficial for improving the development of fast DNA sequencing technology through MoS2 nanopore in the future. Moreover, the ds-DNA structure is still stable after adsorption on the surface of MoS2. These simulation results greatly enhanced our understanding on the interaction between ds-DNA and MoS2 and may promote the promising application of MoS2 in the field of biosensor and DNA sequencing.

The target analytes were determined by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detector. Surfactant vesicle was adopted as extraction solvent. Different operating conditions including the type and concentration of vesicle, extraction time and solid to liquid ratio were investigated by single-factor experiments and response surface methodology. Optimized experimental conditions were 1% (w/v) of DTAB/SDS vesicle, 20 min of extraction time and 160 mg/mL of solid to liquid ratio. The proposed method provided good linearity in the linear range of 10-1000 mu g/mL with regression coefficients larger than 0.999, low limits of detection of 27.64-55.67 ng/mL, good precision with relative standard deviations below 0.35%, and satisfactory recoveries of 83.84-90.92% for tested saponins. Consequently, the proposed vesicle based UAE method was well suited for the extraction of saponins in Panax notoginseng.

The two logic states of the photonic cqubit here are encoded by two orthogonal cat states (i.e. superpositions of coherent states) of photons. We show that quantum information of one photonic cqubit can be deterministically transferred between two cavities, with a single-step operation only. As a specific example, we numerically analyse the experimental implementation of this proposal, by considering a set-up of two microwave cavities coupled to a superconducting artificial atom. This proposal can also be applied to transfer one-cqubit quantum information between two modes of a quantum field coupled by a natural or artificial atom.

However, the poor stability of NHases is still one of the main drawbacks for their industrial application. Recently, mesoporous metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been explored as an attractive support material for immobilizing enzymes. Here, we encapsulated a recombinant cobalt-type NHase from Aurantimonas manganoxydans into the cobalt-based MOF ZIF-67 by a biomimetic mineralization strategy. The nano-catalyst NHase1229@ZIF-67 shows high catalytic activity for the hydration of 3-cyanopyridine to nicotinamide, and its specific activity reached 29.5 U mg(-1). The NHase1229@ZIF-67 nanoparticles show a significant improvement in the thermal stability of NHase1229. The optimum reaction temperature of NHase1229@ZIF-67 is at 50-55 degrees C, and it still retained 40% of the maximum activity at 70 degrees C. However, the free NHase1229 completely lost its catalytic activity at 70 degrees C. The half-lives of NHase1229@ZIF-67 at 30 and 40 degrees C were 102.0 h and 26.5 h, respectively. NHase1229@ZIF-67 nanoparticles exhibit an excellent cycling performance, and their catalytic efficiency did not significantly decrease in the initial 6 cycles using 0.9 M 3-cyanopyridine as the substrate. In a fed-batch reaction, NHase1229@ZIF-67 can efficiently hydrate 3-cyanopyridine to nicotinamide, and the space-time yield was calculated to be 110 g center dot L-1 center dot h(-1). Therefore, the cobalt-type NHase was immobilized in MOF ZIF-67, which is shown as a potential nanocatalyst for the large-scale industrial preparation of nicotinamide.

In this work, through first-principles calculations, we have comprehensively investigated the structural and electronic properties of hydrogenated group V TMDN nanosheets. We find that surface hydrogenation can well stabilize the H-, T- and M-phase structures of group V TMDNs, for which the formed MN2H2 nanosheets have robust energetic, dynamical and thermal stabilities. Different from pristine MN2 systems, the H-phase system has become the most favorable structure of MN2H2 nanosheets. Intrinsic ferromagnetism is present in these H-MN2H2 nanosheets, which even exhibit bipolar magnetic semiconducting behaviors. More interestingly, large spontaneous valley polarization occurs in the H-MN2H2 nanosheets, and is attributed to the coexistence of remarkable spin-orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions according to the k center dot p model analysis. Among them, the H-NbN2H2 nanosheets are found to be a promising ferrovalley material, whose valley polarization value reaches as large as 0.11 eV and the Curie temperature is up to 225 K. Besides that, versatile electronic properties are obtained in the T- and M-phase structures of the MN2H2 nanosheets, which will be magnetic/nonmagnetic metals/semiconductors depending on the metal species and phase structures. Our study demonstrates that the hydrogenation can bring robust structural stabilities and unconventional electronic properties into the group V TMDN nanosheets, which enable many potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics.

The conventional 2D gold nanoparticle films usually possess symmetric structures and identical properties of gold nanoparticles on both sides. Herein, we developed an easy and efficient approach to construct a new type of free-standing 2D gold nanoparticle monolayer film with asymmetric gold nanoparticle structures and functions, called a 2D Janus gold nanoparticle film. The remarkable feature of our method is the subsequent asymmetric growth on one side of the interfacial self-assembled gold nanoparticle monolayer film at the air liquid interface. It is very easy to control the morphology of the Janus film by simply and precisely adjusting the size and shape of the gold nanoparticles on the top side, and selectively tuning the structure and composition on the bottom side of the film by growing gold nanoparticles or other noble metals such as Ag, Pt, and Pd. Unlike the conventionally prepared Janus films at solid substrate that require long-time etching and transfer procedures, other features of our method include the short time in which the interfacial self-assembly and the subsequent asymmetric growth are completed as well as the easily transferable property of the Janus film onto different substrates, such as quartz glass sheets, silicon wafers, and PDMS. The obtained Janus gold nanoparticle film shows asymmetric wettabilities, optical properties, and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) effects, which is promising for a range of potential applications in optical devices, sensors, and asymmetric catalysis.

Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register for studies from 1999 to 2019 to assess the perioperative outcomes and safety of transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy and the retroperitoneal approach for laparoscopic adrenalectomy in patients with pheochromocytoma. After data extraction and quality assessments, we used RevMan 5.2 to pool the data. Results Four retrospective studies were obtained in our meta-analysis. Patients who underwent retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy were associated with shorter operative time (WMD: 34.91, 95% CI: 27.02 to 42.80, I2 = 15%; p < 0.01), less intraoperative blood loss (WMD: 139.32, 95% CI: 125.38 to 153.26, I2 = 0, p < 0.01), and a shorter hospital stay (WMD: 2, 95% CI: 1.18 to 2.82, I2 = 82%, p < 0.01) than patients who underwent transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. No significant differences were found in the complication rate (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 0.58 to 4.33, I-2 = 0; p = 0.38) or in the incidence of hemodynamic crisis (OR: 0.74, 95% CI: 0.19 to 2.94, p = 0.67) between the two groups. Conclusion Retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy could achieve better perioperative outcomes than the transperitoneal approach for patients with pheochromocytoma.

Association of leaf silicon content with chronic wind exposure across and within herbaceous plant species	GLOBAL ECOLOGY AND BIOGEOGRAPHY			English	Article						leaf functional traits; mechanical protection; phylogeny; silica; wind speed; wind stress	LODGING RESISTANCE; DEFENSES; RICE; GROWTH; LEAVES; GRASSES; IMPACTS; CHARACTERS; HERBIVORY; PATTERNS	Aim High foliar silicon (henceforth Si) concentration protects plant tissues against herbivory, but protection against several abiotic stressors has also been proposed, although the adaptive significance of these functions is still being debated. We aimed to explore the potential relationships between foliar Si content and chronic wind exposure across a large scale and multiple species and to analyse an overlooked alternative or complementary function of silicon in leaves: mechanical protection against wind. Location Mainland China. Time period From July to September during 2012-2014. Major taxa studied Two hundred and eighty-two vascular plant species in predominantly herbaceous communities. Methods We compiled a dataset for leaf silicon concentration ([Si]) across 27 sites and 153 herbaceous plots within the major climate zones of China. We hypothesized that evolutionary lineages that generally have high [Si] should show positive relationships between leaf [Si] and mean annual wind speed. Results Within major families with generally high [Si] (especially grasses, sedges and composites), leaf [Si] exhibits a consistently positive correlation with mean wind speed among species across China. For the seven widespread monocot species with high leaf [Si], including the globally distributed common reed (Phragmites australis), intraspecific variation in leaf [Si] exhibits the same consistent positive correlation with mean wind speed. Main conclusions Our findings suggest that high leaf [Si] is likely to have widespread adaptive value for wind exposure of leaves, at least in several very widespread families and species of herbaceous plants. Damage from wind is a danger for plants in many ecosystems, hence these findings are of global significance and indicate that further research into large-scale variation of leaf Si and mechanical traits in relationship to wind exposure is likely to be illuminating.

P. capitalensis is an endophyte fungus of citrus while P. citricarpa can cause black spot of citrus (e.g., oranges and mandarins). P. citriasiana was identified recently which is the causal agent of the pomelo tan spot. Here, we present the similar to 34 Mb genome of P. citriasiana. The genome is organized in 92 contigs, encompassing 9202 predicted genes. Comparative genomic analyses with two other Phyllosticta species (P. citricarpa and P. capitalensis) associated with citrus was conducted to understand their evolutionary conservation and diversification. Pair-wise genome alignments revealed that these species are highly syntenic. All species encode similar numbers of CAZymes and secreted proteins. However, the molecular functions of the secretome showed that each species contains some enzymes with distinct activities. The three Phyllosticta species investigated shared a core set of 7261 protein families. P. capitalensis had the largest set of orphan genes (1991), in complete contrast to that of P. citriasiana (364) and P. citricarpa (262). Most of the orphan genes are functionally unknown, but they contain a certain number of species-specific secreted proteins. A total of 23 secondary metabolites biosynthesis clusters were identified in the three Phyllosticta species, 21 of them being highly conserved among these species while the remaining two showed whole cluster gain and loss polymorphisms or gene content polymorphisms. Taken together, our study reveals insights into the genetic mechanisms of host adaptation of three species of Phyllosticta associated with citrus and paves the way to identify effectors that function in infection of citrus plants.

The myelination of axons in vertebrates enables fast, saltatory impulse propagation, and this process relies on organelles, especially on mitochondria to supply energy. Approximately 99% of mitochondrial proteins are encoded in the nucleus. Since mitochondria play a central role in the energy production and metabolic pathways, which are essential for myelinogenesis, studying these nucleus-encoded genes (nMGs) may provide new insights into the roles of energy metabolism in demyelinating diseases. In this work, a multiomics-based approach was employed to 1) construct a 1,740 human nMG subset with mitochondrial localization evidence obtained from the Integrated Mitochondrial Protein Index (IMPI) and MitoCarta databases, 2) conduct an evolutionary genomics analysis across mouse, rat, monkey, chimp, and human models, 3) examine dysmyelination phenotype-related genes (nMG subset genes with oligodendrocyte- and myelin-related phenotypes, OMP-nMGs) in MGI mouse lines and human patients, 4) determine the expression discrepancy of OMP-nMGs in brain tissues of cuprizone-treated mice, multiple sclerosis patients, and normal controls, and 5) conduct literature data mining to explore OMP-nMG-associated disease impacts. By contrasting OMP-nMGs with other genes, OMP-nMGs were found to be more ubiquitously expressed (59.1% vs. 16.1%), disease-associated (67.3% vs. 20.2%), and evolutionarily conserved within the human populations. Our multiomics-based analysis identified 110 OMP-nMGs implicated in energy production and lipid and glycan biosynthesis in the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of demyelinating disorders. Future targeted characterization of OMP-nMGs in abnormal myelination conditions may allow the discovery of novel nMG mediated mechanisms underlying myelinogenesis and related diseases.

However, the unit of blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal is arbitrary and hence ALFF is sensitive to the scale of raw signal. A well-accepted standardization procedure is to divide each voxel's ALFF by the global mean ALFF, named mALFF. Although fractional ALFF (fALFF), a ratio of the ALFF to the total amplitude within the full frequency band, offers possible solution of the standardization, it actually mixes with the fluctuation power within the full frequency band and thus cannot reveal the true amplitude characteristics of a given frequency band. The current study borrowed the percent signal change in task fMRI studies and proposed percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) for RS-fMRI. We firstly applied PerAF and mPerAF (i.e., divided by global mean PerAF) to eyes open (EO) vs. eyes closed (EC) RS-fMRI data. PerAF and mPerAF yielded prominently difference between EO and EC, being well consistent with previous studies. We secondly performed test-retest reliability analysis and found that (PerAF approximate to mPerAF approximate to mALFF) > (fALFF approximate to mfALFF). Head motion regression (Friston-24) increased the reliability of PerAF, but decreased all other metrics (e.g. mPerAF, mALFF, fALFF, and mfALFF). The above results suggest that mPerAF is a valid, more reliable, more straightforward, and hence a promising metric for voxel-level RS-fMRI studies. Future study could use both PerAF and mPerAF metrics. For prompting future application of PerAF, we implemented PerAF in a new version of REST package named RESTplus.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of J/psi -> Xi(1530+)(-) (Xi)over-bar(+) and evidence for the radiative decay Xi(153)(-) -> gamma Xi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BARYON	The SU(3)-flavor violating decay J/psi -> Xi(1530)(-) (Xi) over bar (+) + c.c. is studied using (1310.6 +/- 7.0) x 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, and the branching fraction is measured to be B(J/psi -> Xi(1530)(-) (Xi) over bar (+) + c.c.) = (3.17 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.08(syst)) x 10(-4). This result is consistent with previous measurements with an order of magnitude improved precision. The angular parameter for this decay is measured for the first time and is found to be alpha = -0.21 +/- 0.04(stat) +/- 0.06(syst). In addition, we report evidence for the radiative decay Xi(1530)(-) -> gamma Xi(-) with a significance of 3.9 sigma, including the systematic uncertainties. The 90% confidence level upper limit on the branching fraction is determined to be B(Xi(1530)(-) -> gamma Xi(-)) <= 3.7%.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, N.; Chang, J.

Herein, we report the preparation and mechanism study of a novel nanocomposite, Cu2+-modified hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets-supported subnanometer gold nanoparticles (Au NPs/Cu2+-BNNS). Interestingly, our investigation reveals that Cu2+-BNNS exhibits strong peroxidase mimetic nanoenzyme activity, while Au NPs/Cu2+-BNNS exhibits excellent oxidase-like activity, that is, it can catalyze the oxidation reaction of the substrate in the absence of an oxidant such as H2O2. For example, Au NPs/Cu2+-BNNS can efficiently and selectively oxidize 3,3',5,5'-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and 3,3'-dimethylbiphenyl-4,4'-diamine (OT) coloration without the presence of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and H2O2. It is worthy to note that AuNPs/Cu2+-BNNS-induced TMB coloration only takes 4 min to reach the platform, while the conventional HRP H2O2 system takes more than 30 min to reach the platform. Further mechanism study shows that the zeta potential, oxidation potential, and steric hindrance of the oxidative chromogenic substrate determine the selectivity of oxidation coloration, while the oxidase-like properties of Au NPs/Cu2+-BNNS are derived from reactive oxygen species generated by the adsorbed oxygen, and Cu2+ ion can synergistically promote the oxidation process. Compared with conventional biological enzymes, Au NPs/Cu2+-BNNS has the advantages of being HRP free and H2O2 free, having high efficiency, low cost, and good stability, and is successfully demonstrated for the detection of carcinoembryonic antigen (a universal cancer biomarker) and H2S (the third gaseous signal molecule).

It crystallizes in a tetragonal structure (space group I4(1)md, No. 109), featuring three dimensional honeycomb networks of Pt-As and a much elongated c-axis (a = b = 4.18 angstrom, and c = 43.70 angstrom). The superconductivity of CaPtAs with T-c = 1.47 K was characterized by means of electrical resistivity, specific heat, and ac magnetic susceptibility. The electronic specific heat C-e(T)/T shows evidence for a deviation from the behavior of a conventional BCS superconductor, and can be reasonably fitted by a p-wave model. The upper critical field mu H-0(c2) of CaPtAs exhibits a moderate anisotropy, with an in-plane value of around 204 mT and an out-of-plane value of 148 mT. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the Pt-5d and As-4p orbitals mainly contribute to the density of states near the Fermi level, showing that the Pt-As honeycomb networks may significantly influence the superconducting properties.

Drosophila Chchd2, a homolog of the human disease-related genes CHCHD2 and CHCHD10, encodes a mitochondrial protein. In this study, we found that loss of Chchd2 in flies resulted in progressive degeneration of photoreceptor cells and reduced muscle integrity. In the flight muscles of adult Chchd2 mutants, some mitochondria exhibited curling cristae and a reduced number of cristae compared to those of controls. Overexpression of Chchd2 carrying human disease-related point mutations failed to fully rescue the mitochondrial defects in Chchd2 mutants. In fat body cells, loss of Chchd2 resulted in fragmented mitochondria that could be partially rescued by Marf overexpression and enhanced by Opa1 RNAi. The expression level of Opa1 was reduced in Chchd2 mutants and increased when Chchd2 was overexpressed. The chaperone-like protein P32 co-immunoprecipitated with Chchd2 and YME1L, a protease known to processes human OPA1. Moreover, the interaction between P32 and YME1L enhanced YME1L activity and promoted Opa1 degradation. Finally, Chchd2 stabilized Opa1 by competing with P32 for YME1L binding. We propose a model whereby Chchd2 regulates mitochondrial morphology and tissue homeostasis by fine-tuning the levels of OPA1.

Resting-State Functional Connectivity of the Thalamus in Complete Spinal Cord Injury	NEUROREHABILITATION AND NEURAL REPAIR			English	Article						spinal cord injury; pulvinar nucleus; mediodorsal nucleus; fMRI; thalamus	MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; CORTICOCORTICAL COMMUNICATION; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; BRAIN; REORGANIZATION; AREAS; NETWORKS; NUCLEUS	Background. Neuroimaging studies of spinal cord injury (SCI) have mostly examined the functional organization of the cortex, with only limited focus on the subcortical substrates of the injury. However, thalamus is an important modulator and sensory relay that requires investigation at a subnuclei level to gain insight into the neuroplasticity following SCI. Objective. To use resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the functional connectivity (FC) of thalamic subnuclei in complete SCI patients. Methods. A seed-based connectivity analysis was applied for 3 thalamic subnuclei: pulvinar, mediodorsal, and ventrolateral nucleus in each hemisphere. A nonparametric 2-sample t test with permutations was applied for each of the 6 thalamic seeds to compute FC differences between 22 healthy controls and 19 complete SCI patients with paraplegia. Results. Connectivity analysis showed a decrease in the FC of the bilateral mediodorsal nucleus with right superior temporal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex in the SCI group. Similarly, the left ventrolateral nucleus exhibited decreased FC with left superior temporal gyrus in SCI group. In contrast, left pulvinar nucleus demonstrated an increase in FC with left inferior frontal gyrus and left inferior parietal lobule in SCI group. Our findings also indicate a negative relationship between postinjury durations and thalamic FC to regions of sensorimotor and visual cortices, where longer postinjury durations (12 months) is associated with higher negative connectivity between these regions. Conclusion. This study provides evidence for reorganization in the thalamocortical connections known to be involved in multisensory integration and affective processing, with possible implications in the generation of sensory abnormalities after SCI.

Method A total of 125 children with MPP were included in the MPP group and 89 children with Mycoplasma-negative pneumonia were included in the control group, and the sera were collected from the children at both the acute and recovery stages in the two groups. Results The sialic acid and C3 in the MPP group were significantly higher than those in the control group both at the acute and at the recovery stage. On the other hand, the sialic acid and C3 at the acute stage were significantly higher than those at the recovery stage in the MPP group. However, in the control group, the sialic acid and C3 demonstrated IgG exhibited no significant change between the acute stage and the recovery stage. Lastly, positive correlations between sialic acid level and C3 level were identified in the MPP group at both acute and recovery stages. Conclusion Our study demonstrated that the serum sialic acid correlated with C3 specifically increased in children with MPP, indicating that it might be the important non-specific parameters in the diagnosis of MPP.

Although many studies have investigated the pathogenesis of overweight and obesity, multiple regulatory factors underlying the onset of obesity-related metabolic disorders remain elusive. Macrophages contribute to modulation of obesity-related inflammation and insulin resistance (IR); adipose tissue macrophages are particularly important in this context. Based on newly identified links between the chemokine system and obesity, macrophage polarization has become an essential target of new therapies for obesity-related IR. The findings of multiple studies imply that variations in gut microbiota and its metabolites might contribute to the regulation of obesity and related metabolic disorders. Recently, several novel antidiabetic drugs, applied as treatment for weight loss, were shown to be effective for obesity-induced IR and other comorbidities. The present review will discuss the properties and functions of macrophages in adipose tissue under conditions of obesity from three perspectives: the chemokine system, the gut microbiota, and antidiabetic drug application. It is proposed that macrophages might be a key therapeutic target for obesity-induced complications.

This study aims to measure income-related inequality in dietary knowledge, and to explain the sources of the inequality. Data were from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) conducted in 2015. A summary of the dietary knowledge score and dietary guideline awareness was used to measure the dietary knowledge of respondents. The concentration index was employed as a measure of socioeconomic inequality and was decomposed into its determining factors. The study found that the proportion of respondents who correctly answered questions on dietary knowledge was significantly low for some questions. Compared to rural residents, urban residents had a higher proportion of correctly answered dietary knowledge questions. In addition, there are pro-rich inequalities in dietary knowledge. This observed inequality is determined not only by individual factors but also high-level area factors. Our study recommends that future dietary education programs could take different strategies for individuals with different educational levels and focus more on disadvantaged people. It would be beneficial to consider local dietary habits in developing education materials.

The development of innovative strategies and safe sensitizers is required to overcome MDR. Paclitaxel (PTX) is a widely used chemotherapeutic drug, the application of which has been learn to understand MDR. However, the application and use are severely restricted because of this MDR. Cyclodextrins (CDs) of many carriers, additionally have shown anti-cancer capability in MDR cancer cells. In this study, novel paclitaxel/hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin complex-loaded liposomes (PTXCDL) have been developed in an attempt to overcome MDR in a PTX-resistant human lung adenocarcinoma (A549/T) cell line. The in vitro application of PTXCDL exhibited pH-sensitive PTX release, potent cytotoxicity, and enhanced intracellular accumulation. In comparison to in vivo, PTXCDL also show a stronger inhibition of tumor growth. In comparison, these findings suggest that the PTXCDL provide a novel strategy for effective therapy of resistant cancers by overcoming the drug resistance.

Accumulating evidence indicates that the cause and maintenance of OCD are related to attentional bias. In this study, the neural processes underpinning attentional bias were carefully inspected for thirty participants with a high/low propensity of OC symptoms (HOC/LOC). Both behavioral and electroencephalogram (EEG) data were collected while participants were performing a dot-probe task with the threat or neutral pictures as stimuli. It was discovered from the event-related potential (ERP) results that compared to the neutral pictures, the threat pictures elicited higher amplitudes of ERP component $C1$ for both the HOC and LOC groups during the stimuli onset period. However, only the HOC group exhibited lower amplitudes of ERP component $P1$ to the threat pictures than to the neutral ones, indicating that individuals with a high level of contamination fear might divert their attention away from the threat automatically. The novel findings from the present study can pave an avenue for unveiling the complex neural mechanism associated with attentional avoidance in individuals with contamination fear.

Materials and methods: The study included 392 cases of TI-RADS category 4 thyroid nodules that underwent thyroidectomy between January 2017 and October 2019. All patients underwent ultrasonography, ultrasound elastography, and fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) before surgery. The nodules were classified into different categories based on the KWAK-TIRADS, ES, and BSRTC. Patients were divided into two groups based on postoperative pathological characteristics. The sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated. Student's t-test and Pearson chi-square test were used to compare diagnostic performance. Results: There were 159 patients in the benign group and 233 in the malignant group. The percentage of malignant nodules in KWAK-TIRADS categories 4a, 4b, and 4c were 44.3%, 64.8%, and 92.9%, respectively. The percentages of malignant nodules in ES 2, 3, 4, and 5 were 0%, 37.1%, 93.8%, and 100%, respectively. The percentage of malignant nodules in BSRTC levels I, II, III, IV, V and VI were 57.1%, 2.8%, 9.9%, 76.6%, 99.1%, and 100%, respectively. Among those methods, the BSRTC had better diagnostic efficiency than the KWAK-TIRADS and ES (Sp 81.1%, Se 93.6%, and AUC 0.918, P<0.01). Among the combined methods, KWAK-TIRADS+ES+BSRTC was more effective than KWAK-TIRADS+ES, KWAK-TIRADS+BSRTC, and ES+BSRTC (Sp 93.7%, Se 91.4%, and AUC 0.967, P<0.01). Conclusion: The combination of KWAK-TIRADS, ES, and BSRTC can improve the accuracy of identifying category 4 thyroid nodules.

J	Han, D; Fang, Y T; Luo, H				Han, Dai; Fang, Yantong; Luo, Hong			A Predictive Model Offor Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder Based on Clinical Assessment Tools	NEUROPSYCHIATRIC DISEASE AND TREATMENT			English	Article						attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; LibSVM; parent rating scale; child; behavior checklist; integrated visual and auditory continuous performance testing	ADHD	Background: At present, clinicians diagnose that the clinical diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children is mainly on the basis of the information provided by their parents, the behaviour of children in clinical clinics and the assessments of clinical rating scales and neuropsychological tests. Notably, no unified standard exists currently for analysing the results of various measurement tools for diagnosing ADHD. Therefore, clinicians interpret the results of clinical rating scales and neuropsychological tests entirely based on their clinical experience. Methods and subjects:: To provide guidance for clinicians on how to analyse the results of various clinical assessment tools when diagnosing ADHD, this study assessed children with ADHD and children in the control group using two clinical assessment scales-parent rating scale (PSQ) and Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-and one neuropsychological test (Integrated Visual and Auditory Continuous Performance Testing). The two-sample t-test (FDR correction) screened the parameters of the three assessment tools with significant inter-group differences. LibSVM was used to establish a classification prediction model for analysing the accuracy of ADHD prediction using parameters of the three assessment tools and weight values of each parameter for classification prediction. Results: A total of 19 parameters (16 from clinical rating scales, 3 from neuropsychological tests) with significant inter-group differences were screened. The accuracy of classification modelling was higher for the clinical rating scales (61.635%) than for the neuropsychological test (59.784%), whereas the accuracy of classification modelling was higher for the clinical rating scales combined with the neuropsychological test (70.440%) than for the former two parameters alone. The three parameters with the highest weight values were learning problem (0.731), hyperactivity/impulsivity (0.676) and activity capacity (0.569). The three parameters with the lowest weight values are integrated control force (0.028), visual attention (0.028) and integrated attention (0.034). Conclusion: Our study findings indicate that the diagnosis of ADHD should be based on multidimensional assessment. For a more accurate diagnosis of ADHD, assessments and that more assessment parameters should be developed on the basis of different dimensions of physiology or psychology in the future to obtain a more accurate diagnosis of ADHD. Furthermore, the predictive model for ADHD may improve our understanding and help in optimisation of the treatment of such a condition.

Therefore, new cell death forms have focused on identifying indirect targets to inhibit Ras-induced oncogenesis. Recently, emerging evidence has shown the potential of triggering ferroptosis for cancer therapy, particularly for eradicating aggressive malignancies that are resistant to traditional therapies. Methods: KRAS mutant CRC cell HCT116 and Lovo were treated with cetuximab and beta-elemene, a bioactive compound isolated from Chinese herb Curcumae Rhizoma. Ferroptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transformation (EMT) were detected in vitro and in vivo. Orthotopic CRC animal model were established and the tumor growth was monitored by IVIS bioluminescence imaging. Tumor tissues were collected to determine ferroptosis effect and the expression of EMT markers after the treatment. Results: CCK-8 assay showed that synergetic effect was obtained when 125 pg/ml beta-elemene was combined with 25 mu g/ml cetuximab in KRAS mutant CRC cells. AV/PI staininz suggested a non-apoptotic mode of cell death after the treatment with beta-elemene and cetuximab. In vitro, beta-elemene in combination with cetuximab was shown to induce iron-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, glutathione (GSH) depletion, lipid peroxidation, upregulation of HO-1 and transferrin, and downregulation of negative regulatory proteins for ferroptosis (GPX4, SLC7A11, FTH1, glutaminase, and SLC40A1) in KRAS mutant CRC cells. Meanwhile, combinative treatment of beta-elemene and cetuximab inhibited cell migration and decreased the expression of mesenchymal markers (Vimentin, N-cadherin, Slug, Snail and MMP-9), but promoted the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin. Moreover, ferroptosis inhibitors but not other cell death suppressors abrogated the effect of beta-elemene in combination with cetuximab on KRAS mutant CRC cells. In vivo, co-treatment with beta-elemene and cetuximab inhibited KRAS mutant tumor growth and lymph nodes metastases. Conclusions: Our data for the first time suggest that the natural product beta-elemene is a new ferroptosis inducer and combinative treatment of beta-elemene and cetuximab is sensitive to KRAS mutant CRC cells inducing ferroptosis and inhibiting EMT, which will hopefully provide a prospective strategy for CRC patients with RAS mutations.

Previous studies have identified the central role of osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in the pathogenesis of PPO. Thus, therapeutic approaches of inhibiting osteoclast formation and activity are considered to be of great potential to prevent and treat this osteolytic disease. Hedgehog (Hh) signaling has been shown to play an important role in promoting osteoblast differentiation and bone formation. While Hh signaling is also implicated in regulating osteoclastogenesis, whether it can directly inhibit osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption remains controversial. Moreover, its potential therapeutic effects on PPO have never been assessed. In this study, we explored the cell-autonomous role of Hh signaling in regulating osteoclastogenesis and its therapeutic potential in preventing wear particle-induced osteolysis. Methods: Hh signaling was activated in macrophages by genetically ablating Sufu in these cells using LysM-Cre or by treating them with purmorphamine (PM), a pharmacological activator of Smoothened (Smo). In vitro cell-autonomous effects of Hh pathway activation on RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and activity were evaluated by TRAP staining, phalloidin staining, qPCR analyses, and bone resorption assays. In vivo evaluation of its therapeutic efficacy against PPO was performed in a murine calvarial model of titanium particle-induced osteolysis by mu CT and histological analyses. Mechanistic details were explored in RANKL-treated macrophages through Western blot analyses. Results: We found that Sufu deletion or PM treatment potently activated Hh signaling in macrophages, and strongly inhibited RANKL-induced TRAP(+) osteoclast production, F-actin ring formation, osteoclast-specific gene expression, and osteoclast activity in vitro. Furthermore, we found that Sufu deletion or PM administration significantly attenuated titanium particle-induced osteoclast formation and bone loss in vivo. Our mechanistic study revealed that activation of Hh signaling suppressed RANKL-induced activation of JNK pathway and downregulated protein levels of two key osteoclastic transcriptional factors, c-Fos and its downstream target NFATc1. Conclusions: Both genetic and pharmacological activation of Hh signaling can cell-autonomously inhibit RANKL-induced osteoclast differentiation and activity in vitro and protect against titanium particle-induced osteolysis in vivo. Mechanistically, Hh signaling hinders osteoclastogenesis partly through suppressing the JNIQc-Fos-NFATc1 cascade. Thus, Hh signaling may serve as a promising therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of PPO and other osteolytic diseases.

However, whether and how the features of dynamic FC would change in patients with MDD are unclear. In this study, we aimed to characterize dynamic FC in MDD using a large multi-site sample and a novel dynamic network-based approach. Methods: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from a total of 460 MDD patients and 473 healthy controls, as a part of the REST-meta-MDD consortium. Resting-state dynamic functional brain networks were constructed for each subject by a sliding-window approach. Multiple spatio-temporal features of dynamic brain networks, including temporal variability, temporal clustering and temporal efficiency, were then compared between patients and healthy subjects at both global and local levels. Results: The group of MDD patients showed significantly higher temporal variability, lower temporal correlation coefficient (indicating decreased temporal clustering) and shorter characteristic temporal path length (indicating increased temporal efficiency) compared with healthy controls (corrected p < 3.14 x 10(-3)). Corresponding local changes in MDD were mainly found in the default-mode, sensorimotor and subcortical areas. Measures of temporal variability and characteristic temporal path length were significantly correlated with depression severity in patients (corrected p < 0.05). Moreover, the observed between-group differences were robustly present in both first-episode, drug-naive (FEDN) and non-FEDN patients. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that excessive temporal variations of brain FC, reflecting abnormal communications between large-scale bran networks over time, may underlie the neuropathology of MDD.

HDAC6 exhibits deacetylase activity not only to histone protein but also to non-histone proteins such as alpha-tubulin, HSP90, cortactin, and peroxiredoxin. These unique functions of HDAC6 have gained significant attention in the medicinal chemistry community in recent years. Thus a great deal of effort has devoted to developing selective HDAC6 inhibitors for therapy with the hope to minimize the side effects caused by pan-HDAC inhibition. Objective: The review intends to analyze the structural feature of the scaffolds, to provide useful information for those who are interested in this field, as well as to spark the future design of the new inhibitors. Methods: The primary tool used for patent searching is SciFinder. All patents are retrieved from the following websites: the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO (R)), the United States Patent Trademark Office (USPTO (R)), Espacenet (R), and Google Patents. The years of patents covered in this review are between 2016 and 2019. Results: Thirty-six patents from seventeen companies/academic institutes were classified into three categories based on the structure of ZBG: hydroxamic acid, 1,3,4-oxadiazole, and 1,2,4-oxadiazole. ZBG connects to the cap group through a linker. The cap group can tolerate different functional groups, including amide, urea, sulfonamide, sulfamide, etc. The cap group appears to modulate the selectivity of HDAC6 over other HDAC subtypes. Conclusion: Selectively targeting HDAC6 over other subtypes represents two fold advantages: it maximizes the pharmacological effects and minimizes the side effects seen in pan-HDAC inhibitors.

However, the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of co-exposure to melamine and CA are not fully clear. Therefore, the cytotoxic effects of melamine and CA were first examined by co-exposure in human kidney 293 cells using the MTT assay. During a 24-h period for the three concentrations tested (0.5, 1, and 5 mg/mL), neither melamine nor CA alone showed significant toxic effects on 293 cells at 0.5 mg/mL, while higher concentrations led to decreased in cell viability. However, co-exposure to several combinations of melamine and CA [100:1, 10:1, 1:10, and 1:100 (v:v), at a final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL] did cause cytotoxicity with higher levels of CA leading to higher cytotoxicity. By contrast, while neither melamine nor CA alone induced phosphorylated-H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci formation, melamine and CA at a 100:1 ratio induced gamma H2AX foci 24 h post-treatment. The alkaline comet assay also revealed the presence of DNA damage following melamine and CA co-exposure. In vivo assay also revealed the presence of melamine-CA complex in the kidney. These data indicated that the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of melamine and CA co-exposure differ from those of melamine or CA alone.

In present study, 126 non-redundant F-box genes were identified in barley (Hordeum vulgare L., Hv). The corresponding proteins contained 165887 amino acid residues and all were amphiphilic, except 5 proteins. Phylogenetic analysis of F-box protein sequences in barley and stress-related F-box protein sequences in wheat and Arabidopsis thaliana (At) was used to classify barley F-box genes are divided into 9 subfamilies (A-I). A structure-based sequence alignment demonstrated that F-box proteins were highly conserved with a total of 10 conserved motifs. In total, 124 F-box genes were unevenly distributed on 7 chromosomes; another 2 genes have not been anchored yet. The gene structure analysis revealed high variability in the number of exons and introns in F-box genes. Comprehensive analysis of expression profiles and phylogenetic tree analysis, a total of 12 F-box genes that may be related to stress tolerance in barley were screened. Of the 12 detected F-box genes, 8 and 10 were upregulated after drought and salt stress treatments, respectively, using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). This study is the first systematic analysis conducted on the F-box gene family in barley, which is of great importance for clarifying this family's bioinformatic characteristics and elucidating its function in barley stress resistance. These results will serve as a theoretical reference for subsequent research on molecular regulation mechanisms, genetic breeding, and improvement.

The YTH domain-containing proteins participate in numerous RNA processes, such as mRNA splicing, nuclear export, translation and decay in post-transcriptional regulation. Most recently, it has been found that YTH domain-containing proteins play important roles in post-transcriptional modification process hence modulate the expression of genes involved in cancer and other processes including cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, migration and invasion, inflammatory, immunity and autophagy. In this review, we summarize the roles and molecular mechanisms of YTH domain-containing proteins in cancer development and progression. In addition, we discuss the prospect of using YTH domain-containing proteins as a new diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancers.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have been proven to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression of cancers. The aim of this study is to develop a useful prognostic index based on lncRNA signature to identify patients at high risk of disease progression. We obtained lncRNA expression profiles from three publicly available datasets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). By the risk scoring method, we built an individualized four-lncRNA signature (HCCLnc-4) to predict survival of HCC patients in the discovery set (ROC curve, AUC: 0.83, 95% CI: 0.65-1.00, P < 0.05, Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank test, P < 0.01). Similar prognostic value of HCCLnc-4 has been further verified in two other independent sets. Stratified analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis suggested the independence of HCCLnc-4 for prediction of HCC patient survival from traditional clinicopathological factors. Area under curve (AUC) analysis suggested that HCCLnc-4 could compete sufficiently with, or might be even better than classical pathological staging systems to predict HCC patient prognosis in the same data sets. Functional analysis and network analysis suggested the potential implication of lncRNA biomarkers. Our study developed and validated the lncRNA prognostic index of HCC patients, warranting further clinical evaluation and preventive interventions.

Neuronally, these may depend on altered relationships between sensorimotor network (SMN) and subcortical structures. The study aimed to investigate the functional relationships of SMN with substantia nigra (SN) and raphe nuclei (RN) via subcortical-cortical loops, and their alteration in bipolar mania and depression, as characterized by psychomotor excitation and inhibition. Method: In this resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study on healthy (n = 67) and BD patients (n = 100), (1) functional connectivity (FC) between thalamus and SMN was calculated and correlated with FC from SN or RN to basal ganglia (BG)/thalamus in healthy; (2) using an a-priori-driven approach, thalamus-SMN FC, SN-BG/thalamus FC, and RN-BG/thalamus FC were compared between healthy and BD, focusing on manic (n = 34) and inhibited depressed (n = 21) patients. Results: (1) In healthy, the thalamus-SMN FC showed a quadratic correlation with SN-BG/thalamus FC and a linear negative correlation with RN-BG/thalamus FC. Accordingly, the SN-related FC appears to enable the thalamus-SMN coupling, while the RN-related FC affects it favoring anti-correlation. (2) In BD, mania showed an increase in thalamus-SMN FC toward positive values (ie, thalamus-SMN abnormal coupling) paralleled by reduction of RN-BG/thalamus FC. By contrast, inhibited depression showed a decrease in thalamus-SMN FC toward around-zero values (ie, thalamus-SMN disconnection) paralleled by reduction of SN-BG/thalamus FC (and RN-BG/thalamus FC). The results were replicated in independent HC and BD datasets. Conclusions: These findings suggest an abnormal relationship of SMN with neurotransmitters-related areas via subcortical-cortical loops in mania and inhibited depression, finally resulting in psychomotor alterations.

J	Chen, WF; Sheng, MM; Mao, JF; Sheng, WG				Chen, Wenfan; Sheng, Mengmeng; Mao, Jiafa; Sheng, Weiguo			Investigating Word Meta-Embeddings by Disentangling Common and Individual Information	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Natural language processing; word meta-embedding; word representation		In the field of natural language processing, combining multiple pre-trained word embeddings has become a viable approach to improve word representations. However, there is still a lack of understanding of why such improvements can be achieved. In this paper, we investigate this issue by firstly proposing a novel word meta-embedding method. The proposed method tends to disentangle common and individual information from different word embeddings and learns representations for both. Based on the proposed method, we then carry out a systematic evaluation to provide a perspective on how common and individual information contributes to different tasks. Our intrinsic evaluation results suggest that common information is critical for word-level representations in terms of word similarity and relatedness. While, based on natural language inference, our extrinsic evaluation results show that common and individual information plays different roles and can complement each other. Further, both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations reveal that explicitly separating common and individual information is beneficial for learning word meta-embeddings.

J	Huang, ZX; Jing, CW				Huang, Zhi-Xing; Jing, Chang-Wei			Super-Resolution Reconstruction Method of Remote Sensing Image Based on Multi-Feature Fusion	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Remote sensing image; super-resolution; self-correlation; image texture		The acquisition of remote sensing images is affected by imaging equipment and environmental conditions. Usually on lower performance devices, the resolution of the acquired images is also low. Among many methods, the super-resolution reconstruction method based on generative adversarial networks has obvious advantages over previous network models in reconstructing image texture details. However, it is found in experiments that not all of these reconstructed textures exist in the image itself. Aiming at the problem of whether the texture details of the reconstructed image are accurate and clear, we propose a super-resolution reconstruction method combining wavelet transform and generative adversarial network. Using wavelet multi-resolution analysis, training wavelet decomposition coefficients in the generative adversarial network can effectively improve the local detail information of the reconstructed image. Experimental results show that our method can effectively reconstruct more natural image textures and make the images more visually clear. In the remote sensing image test set, the four indicators of the algorithm, peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), Feature Similarity (FSIM) and Universal Image Quality (UIQ) are slightly better than the algorithms mentioned in the article.

J	Gong, WY; Chen, DC; Li, S				Gong, Wenyan; Chen, Dechao; Li, Shuai			Active Sensing of Robot Arms Based on Zeroing Neural Networks: A Biological-Heuristic Optimization Model	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Zeroing neural networks (ZNNs); biological-heuristic optimization; nonlinear optimization; inequality and equality constraints; robot motion control	VARYING NONLINEAR OPTIMIZATION; TRACKING CONTROL; MANIPULATORS; DYNAMICS; SYSTEMS; EQUATION	Conventional biological-heuristic solutions via zeroing neural network (ZNN) models have achieved preliminary efficiency on time-dependent nonlinear optimization problems handling. However, the investigation on finding a feasible ZNN model to solve the time-dependent nonlinear optimization problems with both inequality and equality constraints still remains stagnant because of the nonlinearity and complexity. To make new progresses on the ZNN for time-dependent nonlinear optimization problems solving, this paper proposes a biological-heuristic optimization model, i.e., inequality and equality constrained optimization ZNN (IECO-ZNN). Such a proposed IECO-ZNN breaks the conditionality that the solutions via ZNN for solving nonlinear optimization problems can not consider the inequality and equality constraints at the same time. The time-dependent nonlinear optimization problem subject to inequality and equality constraints is skillfully converted to a time-dependent equality system by exploiting the Lagrange multiplier rule. The design process for the IECO-ZNN model is presented together with its new architecture illustrated in details. In addition, the conversion equivalence, global stability as well as exponential convergence property are theoretically proven. Moreover, numerical studies, real-world applications to robot arm active sensing, and comparisons sufficiently verify the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed IECO-ZNN model for the time-dependent nonlinear optimization with inequality and equality constraints.

This study examined Cd accumulation, translocation and allocation among tissues and cellular compartments in Populus cathayana Rehder females and males. Both leaf Cd accumulation and root-to-shoot Cd translocation were significantly greater in females than in males under a normal N supply, but they were reduced in females and enhanced in males under N deficiency. The genes related to Cd uptake and translocation, HMA2, YSL2 and ZIP2, were strongly induced by Cd stress in female roots and in males under a normal N supply. Cadmium largely accumulated in the leaf blades of females and in the leaf veins of males under a normal N supply, while the contrary was true under N deficiency. Furthermore, Cd was mainly distributed in the leaf epidermis and spongy tissues of males, and in the leaf palisade tissues of females. Nitrogen deficiency increased Cd allocation to the spongy tissues of female leaves and to the palisade tissues of males. In roots, Cd was preferentially distributed to the epidermis and cortices in both sexes, and also to the vascular tissues of females under a normal N supply but not under N deficiency. These results suggested that males possess better Cd tolerance compared with females, even under N deficiency, which is associated with their reduced root-to-shoot Cd translocation, specific Cd distribution in organic and/or cellular compartments, and enhanced antioxidation and ion homeostasis. Our study also provides new insights into engineering woody plants for phytoremediation.

The obtained fluorinase@FHAp-NFs were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and FT-IR spectrum and used in the enzymatic synthesis of 5 '-fluorodeoxy adenosin with S-adenosyl-L-methionine and fluoride as substrate. At an optimum pH of 7.5, fluorinase confined in the hybrid nanoflowers presents an approximately 2-fold higher synthetic activity than free fluorinase. Additionally, after heating at 30 degrees C for 8 h, the FHAp-NFs retained approximately 80.0% of the initial activity. However, free enzyme could remain only 48.2% of its initial activity. The results indicate that the fluoride and hybrid nanoflowers efficiently enhance the catalytic activity and thermal stability of fluorinase in the synthesis of 5 '-fluorodeoxy adenosine, which gives a green method for producing the fluorinated organic compounds.

This study was done to identify the risk factors for LN-pr-RLN metastasis and indications for LN-pr-RLN dissection in PTC patients with no clinically detectable node metastasis (CNO). We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 189 patients who underwent total thyroidectomy (24 patients), or right lobectomy (165 patients) with central lymph node (CLN) including LN-pr-RLN dissection for primary PTC. Patients were categorized into two groups according to the median result of the shortest distance between the tumor and the gland capsule. CLN metastases were present in 39.6% (75/189) of patients, and LN-pr-RLN metastases were present in 20.6% (39/189) of the patients. A univariate analysis revealed that LN-pr-RLN metastases were significantly correlated with the size of the tumor (>1 cm), multifocality, the extrathyroidal extension, CLN metastasis, and distance between the tumor and the gland capsule (<= 0.07 cm). A multivariate analysis indicated that the distance between the tumor and the gland capsule (<= 0.07 cm) and extrathyroidal extension were independent risk factors for LN-pr-RLN metastasis. LN-pr-RLN dissection should be considered in patients with CNO PTC when there is extrathyroidal extension, the tumor is >1 cm in size, multifocality, CLN metastases are found in the pre- and intra-operative evaluation, and especially when the distance between the tumor and the gland capsule is <= 0.07 cm with extrathyroidal extension.

Therefore, some resting-state functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging (R-fMRI) studies have used interregional functional connections as discriminative features. The aim of this study was to investigate ADHD-related spatially distributed discriminative features derived from whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity patterns using machine learning. Patients and Methods: We measured the interregional functional connections of the R-fMRI data from 40 ADHD patients and 28 matched typically developing controls. Machine learning was used to discriminate ADHD patients from controls. Classification performance was assessed by permutation tests. Results: The results from the model with the highest classification accuracy showed that 85.3% of participants were correctly identified using leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOV) with support vector machine (SVM). The majority of the most discriminative functional connections were located within or between the cerebellum, default mode network (DMN) and frontoparietal regions. Approximately half of the most discriminative connections were associated with the cerebellum. The cerebellum, right superior orbitofrontal cortex, left olfactory cortex, left gyms rectus, right superior temporal pole, right calcarine gyrus and bilateral inferior occipital cortex showed the highest discriminative power in classification. Regarding the brain-behaviour relationships, some functional connections between the cerebellum and DMN regions were significantly correlated with behavioural symptoms in ADHD (P < 0.05). Conclusion: This study indicated that whole-brain resting-state functional connections might provide potential neuroimaging-based information for clinically assisting the diagnosis of ADHD.

J	Zhou, SJ; Gao, H; Chen, J; Liu, WB				Zhou, Sanjun; Gao, Hong; Chen, Jing; Liu, Wenbing			THE PROTECTIVE EFFECT OF ULINASTATIN IN SEVERE SEPSIS. A MECHANISTIC APPROACH	FARMACIA			English	Article						ulinastatin; severe sepsis; vascular permeability; endothelial polysaccharide coating	NEUTROPHIL ADHESION; ORAL-MUCOSA; CELLS; EXPRESSION; SYNDECAN-1	The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of ulinastatin on endothelial polysaccharide coating and mortality in patients with severe sepsis and septic shock. Twenty-nine cases of sepsis and septic shock diagnosed from June 2015 to December 2018 were included in the study. According to their time of admission, the patients were randomly divided into ulinastatin group (Y, N = 13), which was subdivided in L15 group (APACHE II (Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II) >= 15) (8 cases) and in S15 group (APACHE II < 15) ( 5 cases), and control group (N, N = 16), subdivided in L15 group (11 cases) and S15 group (5 cases). All patients were treated in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The ulinastatin group (Y) received 100,000 U ulinastatin as an intravenous infusion for a period of 8 h, while the control group received routine treatment. Temperature (T), respiratory rate ( RR), heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP), central venous pressure (CVP), and pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI) at 0 h, 24 h and 72 h after admission were determined for each patient. Moreover, the blood samples were collected in order to evaluate the white blood cell count (WBC), lactate (Lac), C-Reactive Protein (CRP), procalcitonin (PCT), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), Syndecan-1 (SDC-1), and systemic central venous oxygen saturation (ScVO2). The results showed that the lactate levels after 72 h of treatment and the 28-day mortality rate of group Y significantly decreased compared to group N (p < 0.018). In L15 subgroup, the lactate level and the 28-day mortality rate in group Y significantly decreased compared to group N (p < 0.018). In S15 subgroup, lactate level, PVPI, SDC-1 and The 28-day mortality rate significantly decreased in group Y compared to group N (p < 0.05). In conclusion, for sepsis patients with an APACHE II score >= 15, their structure of vascular endothelial polysaccharide coating may be affected by many factors, and the effect of ulinastatin is limited. For sepsis patients with an APACHE II score of < 15, ulinastatin may improve vascular permeability, reduce capillary leakage and improve microcirculation by protecting the structure of endothelial polysaccharide coating. In addition, ulinastatin may reduce the mortality of sepsis patients.

PLANT GROWTH REGULATION			English	Article						Barley; SBP-box gene family; Evolutionary analysis; Gene structure; Expression analysis	PROTEIN-LIKE GENES; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; DNA-BINDING; EVOLUTIONARY EXPANSION; SHOOT MATURATION; SQUAMOSA; DOMAIN; MIR156; CHLAMYDOMONAS	The SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN box (SBP-box) gene family is a unique family of transcription factors in plants, which is found widely in green plants. This family functions involve many aspects of crop genetic improvement, such as yield, floral period, and stress resistances; therefore, it has an important practical application value. In this study, 14 non-redundant SBP-box genes were identified and isolated in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) using Hordeum vulgare.IBSC_v2 in combination with bioinformatics analysis. The results revealed that 13 of these genes were unevenly distributed on five chromosomes, and another gene has not been anchored yet. Sequence alignments demonstrated that each SBP protein has highly conserved functional elements (zinc finger structure and nuclear localization signal sequence). Gene structure analysis indicated their diversified exon-introns structure. Phylogenetic analysis was used to classify the barley SBP-box genes into five subfamilies (D-H). Each subfamily was found to contain similar protein motifs and gene structures. Expression profiles based on the barley RNA-seq database found that the barley SBP-box gene family expresses the highest amount in the inflorescence and showed different expression patterns in different tissues and different stages. Overall, the results indicated that the barley SBP-box gene family is relatively conserved in evolution and function, and plays a crucial role in many stages of barley plant growth development. Our results provide a theoretical reference for subsequent studies of molecular regulation and genetic breeding of SBP-box family genes in barley growth and development.

J	Liu, HJ; Wu, CS				Liu, Haijian; Wu, Changshan			Developing a Scene-Based Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) Technique for Individual Tree Crown Reconstruction with LiDAR Data	FORESTS			English	Article						scene-based tin; individual tree crown reconstruction; control points; lidar	CANOPY HEIGHT MODELS; HIGH-DENSITY LIDAR; SURFACE RECONSTRUCTION; DISCRETE-RETURN; POINT CLOUDS; AIRBORNE; FOREST; CLASSIFICATION; VOLUME; DELINEATION	LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging)-based individual tree crown reconstruction is a challenge task due to the variable canopy morphologies and the penetrating properties of LiDAR to tree crown surfaces. Traditional methods, including LiDAR-derived rasterization, low-pass filtering smooth algorithm, and original triangular irregular network (TIN) model, have difficulties in balancing morphological accuracy and model smoothness. To address this issue, a scene-based TIN was generated with three steps based on the local scene principle. First, local Delaunay triangles were formed through connecting neighboring point sets. Second, key control points within each local Delaunay triangle, including steeple, inverted tip, ridge, saddle, and horseshoe shape control points, were extracted by analyzing multiple local scenes. These key points were derived to determine the fluctuations of forest canopies. Third, the scene-based TIN model was generated using the control points as nodes. Visual analysis indicates the new model can accurately reconstruct different canopy shapes with a relatively smooth surface, and statistical analysis of individual trees confirms that the overall error of the new model is smaller than others. Especially, the scene-based TIN derived raster reduced the average error to 0.18 m, with a standard deviation of 0.41, while the average errors of LiDAR-derived raster, low-pass filtered smooth raster, and original TIN derived raster have average errors of 0.96, 2.05, and 1.00 m, respectively. The local scene-based control point extraction also reduces data storage due to the elimination of redundant points, and furthermore the different point densities on different objects are beneficial for canopy segmentation.

In order to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in the prevention of stage II-III NEC, we performed a meta-analysis of clinical studies. Methods: We searched in PubMed, Medline and Embase from 1 January 1990 to 16 January 2018. Heterogeneity was examined by Q-test. Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plot and Egger's regression test. Results: 30 articles were identified meeting the inclusion criteria. Data showed that probiotics supplement could significantly reduce the risk of stage II-III NEC (RR = 0.51, 95% CI, 0.38 to 0.67, P < 0.001) and death rate (RR = 0.69, 95% CI, 0.55 to 0.87, P = 0.002). The mixed probiotics and lactobacillus could reduce the risk of stage II-III NEC (for mixed probiotics, RR = 0.39, 95% CI, 0.26 to 0.57; for lactobacillus, RR = 0.53, 95% CI, 0.36 to 0.78), while bifidobacterium or saccharomyces did not have such effect. The results also indicated that only the mixed probiotics could reduce the risk of deaths (RR = 0.52, 95%CI, 0.34 to 0.80). Subgroup analysis for mortality revealed that probiotics had significant effect in Asian region (RR = 0.54, 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.80, P = 0.002) but not in non-Asian region (RR = 0.84, 95% CI, 0.66 to 1.08, P = 0.179). Conclusions: Probiotics could significantly decrease the risk of stage II-III NEC and death. Compared to using single probiotics species, the application of combining different probiotics has a better efficacy in the prevention of stage II-III NEC and death, especially in the Asian population.

It is important to understand the interaction mechanism between chitosan and BNNTs from atomic level. Herein, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation were employed to investigate the interaction mechanism and loading mechanism of chitosan into/onto BNNTs. The effect of functional group in chitosan and the diameter of BNNTs on the interaction mechanism between BNNTs and chitosan were discussed. It is found that chitosan can only absorb on the outer surface of BNNT (12,12) owing to the size of chitosan and its solvent layer. The loading process of chitosan with -NH2 group (CS_A(10)) into the BNNT (14,14) is much easier than that for -NH3+ group system (CS_B-10). The different loading dynamics for CS_A(10)/CS_B-10 were explained from Gibbs free energy as well as the solvation behavior of chitosan chains. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhao, HY; Zhan, HW				Zhao, Hongyan; Zhan, Hongwei			The use of genitive citations in academic writing	LINGUA			English	Article						Citation; Genitives; Possessee nominals; Evaluative function	ENGLISH; CHINESE; STANCE; CONSTRUCTIONS	Citation, an indispensable feature of academic English writing, is often regarded as an indication of the degree of sophistication in academic writing. Building on previous studies that have shown the importance of integral citation in academic writing, this study investigates one of the subcategories of integral citation: "genitive citation" (e.g., Smith's study, where 's denotes a possessive relationship: the study is in Smith's possession, so Smith is the possessor, study is the possessee). Based on a corpus of 82 articles collected from the discipline of applied linguistics, with 41 from six leading international journals written by experts and 41 from the MICUSP linguistics subcorpus written by college students, this study renders a cognitive semantic analysis of (a) the possessee nominals in genitive constructions and (b) the evaluative functions of genitive citations. Based on the specificity of cue validity, possessee nominals are classified into three types: 1) research-as-a-whole; 2) ideological; and 3) methodological. The analysis yields the following results. First, genitive citations are commonly used by both experts and students, with the use of s-genitive citations significantly outnumbering that of the of-genitives. Second, expert writers prefer possessee nominals with specific meanings while student writers tend to use words with less specificity, especially in terms of methodological possessee nominals. Third, in terms of evaluative function, the expert writers' s-genitive citations include much more sophisticated employment of engagement and attitude resources than those used by student writers, though both groups make extensive use of this structure. Based on the analysis, the study proposes a semantic framework for classifying possessee nominals in sgenitive citations. Limitations of the study and implications for future research are also discussed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared to conventional chemotherapy, anti-tumor vaccines can specifically target cancer cells and they have lower side effects. We developed a recombinant vaccinia virus (VACV) (Western Reserve) WR strain, and we tested its anti-tumor effects in an animal model. Methods: A recombinant VACV WR strain expressing mutant survivin T34A (SurT34A) and FilC was constructed and validated. Its oncolytic effect was tested in vitro using a CCK-8 assay, and its tolerance and anti-tumor effects were tested in a murine gastric cancer model. The proportion of lymphocytes in the spleen and tumor was determined after antibody-mediated immuno-depletion. Results: The recombinant VACV showed a stronger replication ability in tumor cells, and it was safe in vivo, even at high doses. The combination of vv-SurT34A and vv-Fi1C resulted in a stronger anti-tumor effect compared to either construct alone. However, the inhibitory effect of vv-SurT34A was stronger than the combination. The recombinant VACV activated the host immune response, as indicated by lymphocyte infiltration in the spleen and tumor tissues. Conclusion: The recombinant VACV WR strain expressing SurT34A and FilC is a safe and effective anti-tumor vaccine.

Here, we examined the effects of PX on neuronal development and plasticity in the developing optic tectum. We found that HuC/D-positive neurons were more vulnerable than SOX2-positive progenitor cells or BLBP-positive radial glial cells after exposure to PX at 1 mM for 48 h. The further measurement of postsynaptic receptors and synaptic vesicle proteins showed that the expression levels of GluA1 and GluA2, but not Rab3a and SNAP25, were significantly decreased in the tectal brain. In vivo time-lapse images and electrophysiological recordings showed that PX exposure resulted in significant deficits in neuronal structure, particularly in the total dendritic branch length (TDBL), and visual stimulation-induced excitatory compound synaptic currents (eCSCs) without altering neurotransmitter release probability. Strikingly, coexposure to D-glucuronolactone (GA) and PX rescued the structural and functional deficits caused by PX exposure alone. Furthermore, we found that visual experience-induced structural, functional and behavioral plasticity was blocked by PX exposure, which was also rescued by the simultaneous administration of GA and PX. Thus, our findings indicate that PX is neurotoxic to brain development and plasticity and that GA may be considered a promising candidate to treat PX-induced defects in neural circuits.

These findings have provided an unprecedented opportunity to identify individuals in the population at high risk for disease who carry causal genetic mutations and hold great promise for early intervention and individualized medicine. While interest is high in building risk prediction models based on recent genetic findings, it is crucial to have appropriate statistical measurements to assess the performance of a genetic risk prediction model. Predictiveness curves were recently proposed as a graphic tool for evaluating a risk prediction model on the basis of a single continuous biomarker. The curve evaluates a risk prediction model for classification performance as well as its usefulness when applied to a population. In this article, we extend the predictiveness curve to measure the collective contribution of multiple genetic variants. We further propose a nonparametric, U-statistics-based measurement, referred to as the U-Index, to quantify the performance of a multi-locus predictiveness curve. In particular, a global U-Index and a partial U-Index can be used in the general population and a subpopulation of particular clinical interest, respectively. Through simulation studies, we demonstrate that the proposed U-Index has advantages over several existing summary statistics under various disease models. We also show that the partial U-Index can have its own uniqueness when rare variants have a substantial contribution to disease risk. Finally, we use the proposed predictiveness curve and its corresponding U-Index to evaluate the performance of a genetic risk prediction model for nicotine dependence.

There are presently only five plants still remaining in the wild. Since plant endophytes affect the growth and development of the host plant either directly or indirectly, in this study, we adopted the tissue block separation method to isolate 22 endophytic bacteria strains from the roots of O. rehderiana, with 10 strains from wild O. rehderiana and 12 from O. rehderiana plantations. From morphological analysis and 16S rDNA sequence analysis, 6 known genera were identified from the 22 strains. Among the isolated strains, eight were Bacillus (the dominant endophytic bacteria in the root of O. rehderiana), six were Paenibacillus, three were Agrobacterium, three were Paraburkholderia, one was Rhizobium, and one was Pseudomonas. Both wild and plantation O. rehderiana contained Bacillus, Paenibacillus and Paraburkholderia, which presumably could promote the growth of O. rehderiana. Besides, the Rhizobium strain isolated from wild O. rehderiana might be beneficial to the growth of O. rehderiana, but the Agrobacterium strains from the plantations might impair the growth of O. rehderiana.

There are different and conflicting opinions about the relationship between the degree of lumbar lordosis and functional status of patients with chronic low back pain (CLBP). OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the relationships among the lumbar lordosis index, sacral horizontal angle, and CLBP in the elderly. METHODS: Subject data were collected from Lishui City, Zhejiang Province, China, using cluster sampling according to the background information provided by national physical fitness monitoring. The 207 subjects were urban and rural individuals, 60-69 years old. Radiographs were evaluated according to a standardized protocol. The lumbar lordosis index and sacral horizontal angle were recorded. Data on the prevalence and functional status of CLBP were collected through field investigations. Statistical correlations between the radiographic parameters and the prevalence and functional status of CLBP measurements were evaluated. RESULTS: No significant difference was observed in the sacral horizontal angles among the subjects with and without CLBP; however, the lumbar lordosis index of CLBP subjects was significantly higher than that of those without CLBP (P = 0.028) and showed a significant association with CLBP (P = 0.013). Neither the sacral horizontal angle nor the lumbar lordosis index showed significant correlations with the Oswestry Disability Index in CLBP subjects. CONCLUSIONS: The lumbar lordosis index, but not the sacral horizontal angle, was significantly associated with CLBP in the subjects.

Here, we acclimated hatchling of Asian yellow pond turtles (Mauremys mutica) to one of two different temperatures (25 or 30 degrees C) for four weeks to determine temperature acclimation effects on their physiology. All four measured physiological variables (righting time, resting metabolic rate, critical thermal minimum and critical thermal maximum) were significantly affected by temperature acclimation. Turtles acclimated to 25 degrees C righted themselves more slowly and had a lower mean metabolic rate than 30 degrees C-acclimated turtles. Turtles acclimated to 25 degrees C were more resistant to low temperatures, but less resistant to high temperatures than 30 degrees C-acclimated turtles, as measured by critical thermal limits. The thermal resistance range (i.e., the difference between critical thermal minimum and maximum) did not differ between the two acclimation groups. Compared with other semi-aquatic turtles, M. mutica had relatively higher acclimation response ratios for its critical thermal minimum and critical thermal maximum. Our results indicate that acclimation to relatively moderate temperatures could also produce significant responses in the thermal physiology of turtles.

Here, we propose to produce a new type of energy, bio-coal, via a fast pyrolysis coupled with atmospheric distillation process. The high heating values of the as-prepared bio-coals from the representative biomass are within 25.4 to 28.2 MJ kg(-1), which are comparable to that of the commercial coals. Life cycle assessment further shows that the bio-coal production process could achieve net positive energy, financial, and environmental benefits. By using available biomass wastes as feedstock, China is expected to have a total bio-coal production of 402 million tons of standard coal equivalent, which is equal to 13% of national coal consumption. It would grant China an opportunity to additionally cut 738 million tons of CO2 emission by substituting an equal amount of coal with bio-coal in 2030.

Methods: Viability, apoptosis and LRP2 level in TPC-1 cells treated with different doses of metformin for different time points were determined. Besides, protein levels of p-JNK1 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK) in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were detected by Western blot. Regulatory effects of LRP2 on the JNK pathway and cell viability in metformin-treated TPC-1 cells were assessed. Results: Viability in TPC-1 cells gradually decreased with the treatment of increased doses of metformin either for 24 h or 48 h. The apoptotic rate was concentration-dependently elevated by metformin treatment. Relative levels of LRP2 and p-JNK1 were concentration-dependently downregulated by metformin treatment. In addition, overexpression of LRP2 partially abolished the inhibitory effect of metformin on the viability of TPC-1 cells. Conclusion: Metformin treatment suppresses the proliferative ability and induces apoptosis of TPC-1 cells by downregulating LRP2 to block the JNK pathway.

MRF-ZOOM for the unbalanced steady-state free precession (ubSSFP) magnetic resonance fingerprinting	MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING			English	Article						Magnetic resonance fingerprinting; Fast searching; ubSSFP; FISP; T1; T2		In magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF), tissue parameters are determined by finding the best-match to the acquired MR signal from a predefined signal dictionary. This dictionary searching (DS) process is generally performed in an exhaustive manner, which requires a large predefined dictionary and long searching time. A fast MRF DS algorithm, MRF-ZOOM, was recently proposed based on DS objective function optimization. As a proof-of-concept study, MRF-ZOOM was only tested with one of the earliest MRF sequences but not with the recently more popular unbalanced steady state free precession MRF sequence (MRF-ubSSFP, or MRF-FISP). Meanwhile noise effects on MRF and MRF-ZOOM have not been examined. The purpose of this study was to address these open questions and to verify whether MRF-ZOOM can be combined with a dictionary-compression based method to gain further speed. Numerical simulations were performed to evaluate the DS objective function properties, noise effects on MRF, and to compare MRF-ZOOM with other methods in terms of speed and accuracy. In-vivo experiments were performed as well. Evaluation results showed that premises of MRF-ZOOM held for MRF-FISP; noise did not affect MRF-ZOOM more than the conventional MRF method; when SNR >= 1, MRF quantification yielded accurate results. Dictionary compression introduced quantification errors more to T2 quantification. MRF-ZOOM was thousands of times faster than the conventional MRF method. Combining MRF-ZOOM with dictionary compression showed no benefit in terms of fitting speed. In conclusion, MRF-ZOOM is valid for MRFFISP, and can remarkably save MRF dictionary generation and searching time without sacrificing matching accuracy.

Although the therapeutic approaches have improved, the 5-year survival rate of GC patients after surgical resection remains low due to the high rates of metastasis and recurrence. Patients with schizophrenia have significantly lower incidences of cancer after long-term drug treatment, suggesting the potential or partially ameliorate the risk of cancer development of antipsychotic drugs. The goal of this study was to explore antipsychotic drugs with an optional effective therapy against gastric cellular carcinoma. We found that sertindole, an atypical antipsychotic, exhibited anti-tumor efficacy on human GC cells in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, sertindole in combination with cisplatin dramatically enhanced apoptosis-induction in GC cells. In addition, the pro-apoptotic effect of sertindole on GC might in part, involved in inhibition of STAT3 activation and downstream signals, including Mcl1, surviving, c-Myc, cyclin D1. Collectively, these results suggested that sertindole could be a potential anticancer reagent and be an attractive therapeutic adjuvant for the treatment of human GC.

Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states. The here suggested model carries important implications for psychiatric disorders, providing novel and well testable hypotheses especially on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia.

However, there are limited studies investigating caring perceptions in nursing students across multiple cultures. Objective: To determine perceptions of caring in Slovene, Croatian, Chinese and Russian nursing students and explore whether there are statistically significant differences in perceptions of caring between countries and between first and third-year nursing students. Design: A cross-sectional descriptive study design was used. Settings and participants: The study included 604 nursing students enrolled in first and third year in seven different nursing faculties in four countries: Slovenia; China; Croatia; and the Russian Federation. Methods: The 25-item Caring Dimension Inventory (CDI-25) was used to measure caring perceptions. We also included demographic questions regarding age, gender, country, year of study and type of study. Demographic data were analysed using descriptive analysis while a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) adjusted for unequal sample sizes was performed together with a post hoc analysis of the results. Results: The results of two-way ANOVA showed that both main effects (country and year of study) were statistically significant, as well as their interaction at the 0.05 significance level. The main effect for country was F (3, 596) = 3.591, p < 0.0136 indicating a significant difference in CDI-25 between Slovenia (M = 108.9, SD = 9.2), Russian Federation (M = 107.1, SD = 8.2), China (M = 102.8, SD = 9.7) and Croatia (M = 110.0, SD = 8.6). Conclusions: Perceptions of caring in nursing students differ across countries, probably due to different educational systems, curricula, cultural differences and societal values. Implementing caring theories in nursing curricula could help students to cultivate caring during their education.

In this study, we examined physiological, chemical and microstructural traits involving in Cd accumulation, distribution and tolerance under different N forms (NH4+-N and NO3--N). We found that N limitation-insensitive clone Nanlin 1388 had stronger Cd tolerance than N limitation-sensitive clone Nanlin 895 under both N forms, which is associated with Cd elaborate arrangement in tissues and/or cellular compartments, as well as an enhanced antioxidation capacity. NH4+ supply significantly promoted Cd uptake and accumulation in leaves, especially in Nanlin 895, when compared to NO3- supply. Furthermore, NO3- and NH4+ differently regulated Cd distribution in leaves and roots of Nanlin 1388 and Nanlin 895. NO3- supply promoted Cd distribution in leaf epidermis, especially in the upper epidermis of leaf blades and veins in Nanlin 1388. In contrast, NH4+ induced more Cd distribution in the leaf lower epidermis and vascular tissues for Nanlin 895. These results collectively suggested that Nanlin1388 had stronger Cd tolerance, especially under NO3- supply, which provided new insights to engineer woody plants for phytoremediation.

Dynamic event-triggered mechanism for H-infinity non-fragile state estimation of complex networks under randomly occurring sensor saturations	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Complex networks; Dynamic event-triggered mechanisms; Randomly occurring sensor saturations; H-infinity state estimation; Non-fragile state estimation	TIME-DELAY SYSTEMS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; PARTIAL-NODES; OUTPUTS; NOISES	In this paper, the problem of non-fragile H-infinity state estimation is investigated for a class of discrete-time complex networks subject to randomly occurring sensor saturations (ROSSs) under a dynamic event-triggered mechanism (DETM). The ROSS phenomenon is taken into account in the network measurements as a reflection of the probabilistic limitation of the physical sensors, and the DETM is implemented to govern the signal transmission from the sensor to its corresponding state estimator. The objective of the problem addressed is to design an H-infinity non-fragile state estimator under the DETM that can tolerate the possible gain perturbations, thereby possessing the desired non-fragility. By constructing a novel Lyapunov function, a sufficient condition is established such that the estimation error dynamics is exponentially mean-square stable with a prescribed H-infinity performance level, and then the estimator gains are parameterized according to certain matrix inequalities. A simulation example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed state estimation scheme. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Methods: 85 MDD patients and 45 matched normal controls were recruited. MDD was diagnosed based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed (DSM-IV). Symptoms of depression were assessed using the Hamilton depression scale-24 (HAMD-24) at baseline and follow-up (after 8-week treatment). All subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans at baseline, and 30 MDD patients completed scans at 8th week. Whole brain BEN maps at each session was calculated using the BEN mapping toolbox. Results: The 8-week antidepressant treatment improved symptoms for all MDD patients. As compared to normal controls, MDD showed reduced BEN in medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC)/subgenual cingulate cortex (sgACC), but increased BEN in motor cortex (MC). In MDD patients, higher baseline BEN in MOFC/sgACC and lower baseline BEN in temporal cortex (TC) were associated with higher baseline HAMD scores; higher baseline BEN in MOFC/sgACC and hippocampus were associated with greater reduction of HAMD scores after 8-week medication; greater reduction of HAMD scores after 8-week medication was correlated with greater BEN reduction in MOFC/sgACC but were correlated with less BEN reduction in MC, TC, fusiform gyrus (FG) and visual cortex (VC). Conclusion: The results highlighted MOFC/sgACC BEN as a potential marker for the prediction of MDD diagnosis and treatment effect. MDD might have increased MOFC/sgACC BEN but reduced BEN in visual and sensorymotor circuits corresponding to the imbalanced emotional and sensory-motor information processing. Reversing this unbalanced BEN would improve disease conditions in MDD.

Since strong consensus regarding commonly altered MRs in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is lacking, we generated a compendium of HCC datasets from 21 studies and identified a comprehensive signature consisting of 483 genes commonly deregulated in HCC. We then used reverse engineering of transcriptional networks to identify the MRs that underpin the development and progression of HCC. After cross-validation in different HCC datasets, systematic assessment using patient-derived data confirmed prognostic predictive capacities for most HCC MRs and their corresponding regulons. Our HCC signature covered well-established liver cancer hallmarks, and network analyses revealed coordinated interaction between several MRs. One novel MR, SEC14L2, exerted an anti-proliferative effect in HCC cells and strongly suppressed tumor growth in a mouse model.

Firstly, POM/PLLA membranes were aminolyzed by 1,6-hexanediamine to render the membranes with amino groups and porous structure simultaneously. The membranes were then immersed in tetrachloroauric acid (H4AuCl4) solution, where the AuCl4- anions were able to complex with the free amine groups of POM/PLLA, followed by in situ reduction by sodium borohydride to immobilize Au NPs on POM/PLLA membranes. The POM/PLLA/Au membranes exhibited high SERS sensitivity as well as good Raman signal reproductivity for rhodamine 6G (R6G). The minimum detection concentration was 10(-14) M and the enhancement factor was calculated to be 1.54 x 10(9).

Young children are more likely to cheat after overhearing that a classmate is smart	DEVELOPMENTAL SCIENCE			English	Article; Early Access						ability praise; cheating; eavesdropping; overhearing; smart; young children	FEEDBACK; BEHAVIOR; REPUTATION; LANGUAGE; GOSSIP; PRAISE; WORDS; LEARN	Research on moral socialization has largely focused on the role of direct communication and has almost completely ignored a potentially rich source of social influence: evaluative comments that children overhear. We examined for the first time whether overheard comments can shape children's moral behavior. Three- and 5-year-old children (N = 200) participated in a guessing game in which they were instructed not to cheat by peeking. We randomly assigned children to a condition in which they overheard an experimenter tell another adult that a classmate who was no longer present is smart, or to a control condition in which the overheard conversation consisted of non-social information. We found that 5-year-olds, but not 3-year-olds, cheated significantly more often if they overheard the classmate praised for being smart. These findings show that the effects of ability praise can spread far beyond the intended recipient to influence the behavior of children who are mere observers, and they suggest that overheard evaluative comments can be an important force in shaping moral development.

The FIR technique is self-referenced and regarded as a promising method to improve the temperature accuracy and simplify the experimental devices. Herein, a point all-fiber temperature sensor based on the FIR technique has been developed. Er3+/Yb3+ co-doped NaYF4 phosphors (NPs) were used to fabricate a temperature sensing probe combined with silica fiber. Highly crystalline and pure hexagonal NPs were synthesized by a hydrothermal method. Intense green up-conversion luminescence was observed in the prototype sensor at an excitation power of 1 mW. The relationship between FIR value and temperature was investigated at the temperature range of 258-423 K. The maximum relative temperature sensitivity is 1.68% K-1 at 258 K. Preliminary experimental results indicate that the absolute error is +/- 1 K with a temperature uncertainty sigma of 0.187 K and relative standard deviation of 0.133%, suggesting the high accuracy and reliability of the proposed all-fiber temperature sensor.

Here, we aim to understand the molecular mechanisms of Zn deficiency response by integrating the analyses of the global miRNA and mRNA expression profiles under Zn deficiency and resupply in rice seedlings by integrating Illumina's high-throughput small RNA sequencing and transcriptome sequencing. Results: The transcriptome sequencing identified 360 genes that were differentially expressed in the shoots and roots of Zn-deficient rice seedlings, and 97 of them were recovered after Zn resupply. A total of 68 miRNAs were identified to be differentially expressed under Zn deficiency and/or Zn resupply. The integrated analyses of miRNAome and transcriptome data showed that 12 differentially expressed genes are the potential target genes of 10 Zn-responsive miRNAs such as miR171g-5p, miR397b-5p, miR398a-5p and miR528-5p. Some miRNA genes and differentially expressed genes were selected for validation by quantitative RT-PCR, and their expressions were similar to that of the sequencing results. Conclusion: These results provide insights into miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways in Zn deficiency response, and provide candidate genes for genetic improvement of Zn deficiency tolerance in rice.

Core-shell nanostructures are usually formed by the deposition of the second metal atoms onto the first core metal particles via the chemical wet method. The conventional approaches for the manipulation of the shape usually were done by homogeneous growth or etching of isotropic nanoparticles. Through in situ modification of the first metal core at the different locations, the different growth model of the second metal can be regulated to control the shapes of core-shell structures. Herein, we modified the gold nanorods (AuNRs) asymmetrically at the end and side parts using thiolated molecules to regulate the morphology of gold nanorod@silver (AuNR@Ag) core-shell nanoparticles. Interestingly, the obvious eccentric nanostructures of AuNR@Ag core-shell nanoparticles were obtained with the increase of the molecular weight of macromolecules modified at the end of AuNRs. Therefore the growth mode was adjusted from Frank-van der Merwe mode to Stranski-Krastanow mode. By changing the length of the hydrocarbon chain and functional groups of the small mercaptan molecules at the side of AuNRs, the silver shell exhibits selective growth at the side of the AuNRs, resulting in heterogeneous core-shell nanoparticles and various shapes of the AuNR@Ag core-shell. Our method opens up a new avenue toward preparing core shell nanostructures with controlled shapes, and the obtained structures are promising in various applications.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for the decay D-s(+) -> p(p)over-bare(+) nu(e)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a 3.19 fb(-1) data sample collected at the root s = 4.178 GeV with the BESIII detector, we search for the rare decay D-s(+) -> p (p) over bare(+)nu(e). No significant signal is observed, and an upper limit of B(D-s(+) -> p (p) over bare(+)nu(e)) < 2.0 x 10(-4) is set at the 90% confidence level. This measurement is useful input in understanding the baryonic transition of D-s(+) mesons.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Cao, N.; Chang, J. F.; Chang, W. L.; Chen, G.; Chen, H.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of e(+)e(- )-> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)eta(c) and evidence for Z(c) (3900)(+/-) decaying into rho(+/-)eta(c)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO; STATES	We study the reaction e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)eta(c) for the first time using data samples collected with the BESIII detector at center-of-mass energies root s = 4.226, 4.258, 4.358, 4.416, and 4.600 GeV. Evidence of this process is found and the Born cross section sigma(B) (e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)eta(c)), excluding e(+)e(-) -> omega eta(c) and eta eta(c), is measured to be (46(-11)(+12) +/- 10) pb at root s = 4.226 GeV. Evidence for the decay Z(c) (3900)(+/-) -> rho(+/-)eta(c) is reported at root s = 4.226 GeV with a significance of 3.9 sigma, including systematic uncertainties, and the Born cross section times branching fraction sigma(B)(e(+)e(-) -> pi(-/+)Z(c) (3900)(+/-)) x B(Z(c)(3900)(+/-) -> rho(+/-)eta(c)) is measured to be (48 +/- 11 +/- 11) pb, which indicates that e(+) e(-)-> pi(-/+)Z(c) (3900)(+/-) -> pi(-/+)rho(+/-)eta(c) dominates the e(+) e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)eta(c) process. The Z(c)(3900)(+/-)->rho(+/-)eta(c) signal is not significant at the other center-of-mass energies and the corresponding upper limits are determined. In addition, no significant signal is observed in a search for Z(c) (4020)(+/-) -> rho(+/-)eta(c) with the same data samples. The ratios R-Zc(3900) = B(Z(c)(3900)(+/-) -> rho(+/-)eta(c))/B(Z(c)(3900)(+/-) -> pi(+/-)J/psi) and RZ(c)((4020)) = B(Z(c)(4020)(+/-) -> rho(+/-)eta(c))/B(Z(c)(4020)(+/-) -> pi(+/-)eta(c)) are obtained and compared with different theoretical interpretations of the Z(c)(3900)(+/-) and Z(c)(4020)(+/-).

The influence of aliovalent doping of Li+ and Ga3+ in SrMoO4 phosphors on the crystal structure and growth was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). A detailed structural analysis was carried out using Eu3+ ions as a spectroscopic probe to disclose the change of the local site symmetry due to aliovalent doping. The upconversion emission intensity of Er3+ in SrMoO4 phosphors is enhanced by 82 times and 255 times due to Li+ doping and Li+/Ga3+ codoping, respectively. The intense upconversion luminescence and high temperature sensitivity lead to a small temperature uncertainty (0.091 K) and an absolute error (-0.5-0.3 K) as well as good repeatability (<1%). Preliminary experiments from material design to device applications pave the way for the practical applications of ratiometric temperature sensors.

However, it has remained a great challenge to realize high-temperature resilience and flame resistance in polymer foams at an ultra-low loading of flame retardant additives. Herein we report a facile, low-cost and scalable strategy to create unprecedented high-performance polydimethylsiloxane foam materials by the in situ reactive self-assembly of graphene oxide (GO) sheets. Addition of 0.10 wt% GO produces compact and ultrathin protective nano-coatings on the foam surface. Moreover, such nano-coatings are chemically bonded with the foam skeleton. As a result, the nano-coatings produce significantly improved thermal stability and high-temperature resilience as well as synergistic fire shielding properties, enabling similar to 57% and similar to 87% reduction in the heat release rate and total smoke rate at 0.10 wt% and a limiting oxygen index of >31% at 0.50 wt%. By observing the burnt surface zones, we demonstrate that the thermal decomposition of PDMS molecules transforms them into inorganic nano-silica layers and promotes GO graphitization to form compact protective char, leading to synergetic flame retardant properties. The successful fabrication of the fascinating polymer foam materials provides new perspectives for the understanding and design of advanced polymer foam nanocomposite materials.

The methyl group at the 3,5-position can be versatilely functionalized by the Knoevenagel condensation reaction. In this paper, a small series of non-symmetric thieno[3,2-b]thiophene-fused BODIPYs have been prepared via the condensation of 7H-thieno[2 ',3 ':4,5]thieno[3,2-b]pyrrole-6-carbaldehydes and various pyrroles, followed by coordination with BF2. The resulting BODIPY dyes exhibited red absorption and emission with extremely high absorption coefficients (2 x 10(5) M-1 cm(-1)) and fluorescence quantum yields up to 1.00. Importantly, the remaining methyl group at the 3-position can be further functionalized to achieve NIR probes; we then synthesized an organosilicon-based probe for F- and evaluated its imaging in living cells. The structure-property relationships were interpreted on the basis of X-ray crystallography, optical spectroscopy and theoretical calculations.

Methods The expression level of YAP was evaluated by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. Cell viability, cell proliferation and growth were detected by CCK-8, PH3 and Ki67 immunostaining, and the real-time cell analyser system. The nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins of p27(Kip1) were dissociated by the nuclear-cytosol extraction kit and were detected by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry. mRNA levels of Akt, CDK5 and CRM1 were determined by qRT-PCR. Results YAP was enriched in SH-SY5Y cells (a human neuroblastoma cell line). Knock-down of YAP in SH-SY5Y cells or SK-N-SH cell line (another human neuroblastoma cell line) significantly decreased cell viability, inhibited cell proliferation and growth. Mechanistically, knock-down of YAP increased the nuclear location of p27(Kip1), whereas serum-induced YAP activation decreased the nuclear location of p27(Kip1) and was required for cell proliferation. Meanwhile, overexpression of YAP in these serum-starved SH-SY5Y cells decreased the nuclear location of p27(Kip1), promoted cell proliferation and overexpression of p27(Kip1) in YAP-activated cells inhibited cell proliferation. Furthermore, knock-down of YAP reduced Akt mRNA and protein levels. Overexpression of Akt in YAP-downregulated cells decreased the nuclear location of p27(Kip1) and accelerated the proliferation of SH-SY5Y cells. Conclusions Our studies suggest that YAP promotes the proliferation of neuroblastoma cells through negatively controlling the nuclear location of p27(Kip1) mediated by Akt.

However, how rTMS modulates the topological organization of the SMN remains unclear. In this study, we employed resting-state fMRI to investigate the topological alterations in the functional SMN after application of different frequency rTMS over the left M1. To accomplish this, we collected MRI data from 45 healthy participants who were randomly divided into three groups based on rTMS frequency (HF, high-frequency 3 Hz; LF, low-frequency 1 Hz; and SHAM). Individual large-scale functional SMN was constructed by correlating the mean time series among 29 regions of interest (ROI) in the SMN and was fed into graph-based network analyses at multiple levels of global organization and nodal centrality. Our results showed that compared with the network metrics before rTMS stimulation, the left paracentral lobule (PCL) exhibited reduced nodal degree and betweenness centrality in the LF group after rTMS, while the right supplementary motor area (SMA) exhibited reduced nodal betweenness centrality in the HF group after rTMS. Moreover, rTMS-related alterations in nodal metrics might have been attributable to the changes in connectivity patterns and local activity of the affected nodes. These findings reflected the potential of using rTMS over M1 as an effective intervention to promote motor function rehabilitation.

But the details of patients' brain responses to the rTMS are yet to be disclosed. The aim of the study is to explore the neural electrical responses of DOC patients to rTMS modulation. DOC Patients [14 vegetative state, seven minimally conscious state (MCS)] and healthy subjects were enrolled and received one session of rTMS. The TMS-electroencephalogram was recorded at before and immediately after rTMS stimulation. TMS-evoked potentials as well as TMS-evoked connectivity were proposed to capture the effective connectivity alteration induced by rTMS. Significant changes of TMS-evoked potential were found in the healthy group but not in DOC patients. TMS-evoked connectivity was significantly enhanced by the rTMS in healthy and MCS groups. In addition, the enhancement was positively correlated with patients' Coma Recovery Scale-Revised scores. Global synchrony of the TMS-evoked connectivity matrix significantly enhanced by rTMS in the control and MCS groups but not in vegetative state patients. Furthermore, after rTMS stimulation, the similarity of TMS-evoked connectivity patterns between pairwise patients was significantly raised in MCS patients. But no significant changes were found in vegetative state patients. TMS-evoked connectivity reveals that rTMS can effectively modulate effective connectivity of MCS patients, but no evidence of changes in vegetative state patients.

The p53 tumor suppressor gene, a master regulator of diverse cellular pathways, is frequently altered in various cancers, for example, in similar to 36% of hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and similar to 68% of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC5). Current methods for restoration of p53 expression, including small molecules and DNA therapies, have yielded progressive success, but each has formidable drawbacks. Here, a redox-responsive nanoparticle (NP) platform is engineered for effective delivery of p53-encoding synthetic messenger RNA (mRNA). We demonstrate that the synthetic p53-mRNA NPs markedly delay the growth of p53-null HCC and NSCLC cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. We also reveal that p53 restoration markedly improves the sensitivity of these tumor cells to everolimus, a mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitor that failed to show clinical benefits in advanced HCC and NSCLC. Moreover, cotargeting of tumor-suppressing p53 and tumorigenic mTOR signaling pathways results in marked antitumor effects in vitro and in multiple animal models of HCC and NSCLC. Our findings indicate that restoration of tumor suppressors by the synthetic mRNA NP delivery strategy could be combined together with other therapies for potent combinatorial cancer treatment.

However, a lack of suitable advanced anode materials has hindered further applications. Herein, metal-semiconductor mixed phase twinned hierarchical (MPTH) MoS2 nanowires with an expanded interlayer (9.63 angstrom) are engineered and prepared using MoO3 nanobelts as a self-sacrificed template in the presence of a trace amount of (NH4)(6)Mo7O24 center dot 4H(2)O as initiator. The greatly expanded interlayer spacing accelerates Na+ insertion/extraction kinetics, and the metal-semiconductor mixed phase enhances electron transfer ability and stabilizes electrode structure during cycling. Benefiting from the structural merits, the MPTH MoS2 electrode delivers high reversible capacities of 200 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 A g(-1) for 200 cycles and 154 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) for 2450 cycles in the voltage range of 0.4-3.0 V. Strikingly, the electrode maintains 6500 cycles at a current density of 2 A g(-1), corresponding to a capacity retention of 82.8% of the 2nd cycle, overwhelming the all reported MoS2 cycling results. This study provides an alternative strategy to boost SIB cycling performance in terms of reversible capacity by virtue of interlayer expansion and structure stability.

However, how sleep deprivation contributes to the pathogenesis of sleep deficiency disorder remains incompletely defined. Accordingly, more effective treatment methods for sleep deficiency disorder are needed. Thus, to better understand the detailed mechanism of sleep deficiency disorder, a sleep deprivation mouse model was established by the multiple platform method in our study. The accumulation of free radicals and senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) was observed in the sleep-deprived mice. Moreover, our mouse and human population-based study both demonstrated that telomere shortening and the formation of telomere-specific DNA damage are dramatically increased in individuals suffering from sleeplessness. To our surprise, the secretion of senescence-associated cytokines and telomere damage are greatly improved by folic acid supplementation in mice. Individuals with high serum baseline folic acid levels have increased resistance to telomere shortening, which is induced by insomnia. Thus, we conclude that folic acid supplementation could be used to effectively counteract sleep deprivation-induced telomere dysfunction and the associated aging phenotype, which may potentially improve the prognosis of sleeplessness disorder patients.

However, it is still uncertain whether there are any differences between MCI patients with and without depression symptom in their brain function activities. Here we have identified the brain function activity differences in two groups of MCI patients (with depression or without depression) using the resting state MRI (rsfMRI) measurements. 76 right-handed MCI subjects have been recruited in this study, including 27 MCI patients with depression symptom (MCID), 49 MCI patients without depression symptom (MCIND). Analyses based on 7 rsfMRI measurements, including four static measurements (ALFF, fALFF, PerAF, and ReHo) and three dynamic measurements (dALFF, dfALFF, and dReHo) have been used to explore the temporal variability of intrinsic brain activity. No significant differences in ALFF and dALFF between the two group were found. In the MCID group, fALFF decreased in temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, inferior occipital gyrus, middle frontal gyrus and cerebellum, but increased in cuneus, calcarine, lingual; while PerAF increased in left parahippocampus. The differences of ReHo in the two groups was only found in cerebellum. Compared to MCIND group, dfALFF in MCID decreased in cuneus, occipital gyrus and calcarine, while dReHo in MCID increased in bilateral temporal gyrus, frontal gyrus, superior parietal gyrus, inferior parietal gyrus and precuneus. Our results may provide a better understanding in the relationship between the depressive symptoms and memory deficits.

ACS OMEGA			English	Article							POLY(VINYLIDENE FLUORIDE) FILMS; POLY(METHYL METHACRYLATE); BETA-PHASE; POLYMER; BLENDS; COMPOSITES; BEHAVIOR; MISCIBILITY; CRYSTALLIZATION; COMPATIBILITY	The miscibility and physical and rheological properties of binary poly(vinylidene fluoride)/maleic anhydride (PVDF/MAH) blends have been systematically investigated. MAH was found to be miscible with PVDF by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) investigations provided positive evidence for the specific interaction between the carbonyl groups of MAH and the methylene groups of PVDF. Rheological measurements showed that both the storage modulus and the melt viscosity of PVDF increase with the addition of MAH, followed by a decrease with excess MAH. In addition, the elongation of the PVDF/MAH blend with 10 wt % MAH is 589.7%, which is almost 5 times that of neat PVDF. It is concluded that MAH small molecules act as physical "crosslinking" points for the neighboring PVDF molecule chains due to this specific interaction between PVDF and MAH. Such a physical crosslinking function enhances the storage modulus, viscosity, and mechanical properties of PVDF.

Crystallographic and NMR analysis shows that the six-membered (SnAu)(3) ring of 3(-) is planar and highly symmetric with an equal distance of six Au-Sn bonds. A UV/Vis spectrum of 3(-) in hexane reveals an intense absorption maximum at 598 nm. While cyclic Au-3(-) with four valence electrons is known as unstable anti-aromatic anion, 3(-) with three divalent tin ligands is stable sigma aromatic anion with an unprecedented Mobius orbital array as predicted by the perturbation MO and CCSD analysis of 3(-).

The quantitative measurement of it remains absent, which does hinder the basic understanding and applications of reactive compatibilization. In this work, co-continuous structures have been fabricated in PVDF/PLLA with reactive comb compatibilizers (RCC). Based on the co-continuous structures, acid hydrolysis has been employed to remove both reacted and free PLLA, producing acid hydrolysis ratio (AR). On the contrary, only free PLLA can be extracted by chloroform (its selective solvent), corresponding to the extraction ratio (ER). The difference between AR and ER represents the reacted weight percent of PLLA, which is a good parameter to describe the graft ratio (GR). According to the quantitative measurement of GR, the direct evidence for the blending sequence dependence of the extent of graft reaction has been provided. By optimizing the migration and localization of compatibilizers, 50 nm co-continuous structures have been fabricated in (PLLA/RCC)/PVDF, in which GR exhibits the highest magnitude. This is the reason for the best mechanical and optical performances in the resultant specimen. Our results open a new avenue for understanding the reactive compatibilization in polymer blend.

The in-situ-formed graft/block copolymers should be thermodynamically located at the interface to bridge the neighboring phases. Unfortunately, they are often pulled out of the interface because of the asymmetric molecular structures. Here, we propose a new strategy to compatibilize immiscible polymer blends called reactive splicing compatibilization. Poly (styrene-co-glycidyl methacrylate) (SG) with high glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) content is used as the reactive backbone chain. Both poly (L-lactic acid) (PLLA) and poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT) molecular chains can be easily grafted onto the SG main backbone by the reaction of the terminal carboxylic acid groups with the epoxide groups in the melt. Direct melt blending SG with PLLA and/or PBAT leads to reactive compatibilizers with various molecular architectures, which are used for subsequent compatibilization of PLLA/PBAT blends. It was found that the compatibilizer architecture significantly affects the compatibilization efficiency. The best compatibilization occurs with a reactive compatibilizer of SG-g-PBAT with the SG to PBAT weight ratio of 1:2. The compatibilized PLLA/PBAT (50/50 w/w) blend has precise co-continuous phase morphology with very few micelles. The blend exhibits extremely high Charpy notched impact strength of 90.2 kJ/m(2) and tensile strength of 33.3 MPa. The principle of the facile splicing compatibilization strategy is highly applicable to many other immiscible blends with both components containing reactive groups.

This study used permutation entropy (PeEn) of neural activities to quantify brain responses to SCS. Method: We recruited 14 patients with DOC, including seven patients in minimally conscious state (MCS) and seven patients in vegetative state/unawareness state (VS/UWS). All patients received a single session of 20 min' continuous SCS. We recorded resting state EEG before, during and after SCS. In this study, PeEn was first calculated to describe overall neural activities changes in SCS. The brain was then divided into frontal, central, parietal and occipital regions to explore spatial SCS modulation effects. Finally, a correlation analysis was conducted between CRS-R values and changes in PeEn on each of the four regions. Results: SCS was associated with short-term changes in neural activities in DOC. When SCS was on, PeEn increased as compared to the baseline. When SCS was shut off, PeEn decreased. The PeEn of all patients after SCS was higher than before SCS, and changes of PeEn for MCS were more significant than those for VS, especially in the frontal region. Conclusion: PeEn from EEG data could be used to evaluate SCS modulation effects, and EEG complexity might be a critical index to describe brain responses to SCS in DOC.

Based on the numerical results of self-consistent equations, properties of the excited spectrums, magnon internal energy, static susceptibility, magnetization plateau and specific heat are obtained with different bond alternation parameters delta and external magnetic field B. This method provides qualitative consistent results to describe the phase from ferrimagnetic state to bond altered state.

Specifically, dopamine was polymerized in an alkaline solution to generate PDA nano-aggregates as hierarchically rough structure on PU sponge skeleton. After the sponge was further treated with HMDS, the obtained PU-PDA-HMDS sponge surface was transformed from hydrophilic into superhydrophobic with a water contact angle about 153 degrees. The Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement results demonstrated that the PDA nano-aggregates layer was successfully coated onto PU skeleton, and HMDS molecules were grafted onto PDA nano-aggregates layer by forming silicyl groups on sponge. When the superhydrophobic PU-PDA-HMDS sponge was used towards oil-water separation, it exhibited high oil absorption capacity and stable absorption performance even after cyclic absorption-desorption process. Meanwhile, the sponge exhibited good elastic property and recovery ability under compression test. Furthermore, the thermal stability and flame-retardant property of the sponges were measured, and the results showed the resulting PU-PDA-HMDS sponge exhibited superior thermal stability and flame-retardant property to the pristine PU or PU coated with PDA alone. Even encountering a flame attack, the PU-PDA-HMDS sponge would be self-extinguished and remained its structure integrity due to the formation of silica-hybrid char residue layer during combustion process. The formation process of silica-hybrid char residue layer and what role it exerted on enhancing flame-retardant property were proposed and discussed. Therefore, this work not only provided a simple strategy for fabricating the superhydrophobic porous composites for oil-water separation, but also opened a door to protect the combustible porous composites from fire with exceptional flame-retardant performance.

The community structure was analyzed using quantitative real-time PCR. The results suggested that the IC50 of TC and Zn(II) on the PN sludge were 235.8 and 41.8 mg L-1, respectively. The PN sludge was insensitive to TC at a relatively high concentration (<= 300 mg L-1) during the short-term exposure. Long-term test demonstrated that the PN sludge could tolerate 150 mg L-1 of TC after a domestication period. The PN performance was significantly inhibited when the concentration of Zn(II) reached 5 mg L-1. Real-time PCR revealed that the dynamics of the ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) were indicative for the operation of the PN process. The analyses also indicated that there was a direct correlation between the size of the indicative population and PN performance.

This reaction occurred through chemoselective Si-C(sp(2)) bond activation in synergy with ring expansion/insertion of cyclopropenes to form new C(sp(2))-C(sp(3)) and Si-C(sp(3)) bonds. An array of previously elusive bicyclic skeleton with high strain, silabicyclo[4.1.0]heptanes, were formed in good yields with excellent diastereoselectivity under mild conditions. An asymmetric version of the reaction with a chiral phosphoramidite ligand furnished a variety of chiral bicyclic silaheterocycle derivatives with good enantioselectivity (up to 95.5:4.5 er). Owing to the mild reaction conditions, the good stereoselectivity profile, and the ready availability of the functionalized precursors, this process constitutes a useful and straightforward strategy for the synthesis of densely functionalized silacycles.

As a rapidly developing field of plant biology, recent studies have begun to address the function and mechanism of plant SAURs. We found that, in Arabidopsis, the SAUR41 subfamily genes were ABA-inducible, and overexpression of SAUR41 induced the biosynthesis of ABA. The saur41/40/71/72 quadruple mutants and the SAUR41 overexpression lines had an altered expression of ABA and calcium homeostasis/signaling genes, but not the AUX/IAAs and GH3s. Here, we reported that the quadruple mutants showed an increased sensitivity to ABA treatment, in terms of cotyledon greening/expansion rate, while for the overexpression lines, this was decreased. With respect to the root touch response, the overexpression of SAUR41 led to an extensive root looping phenotype, while the quadruple mutations of saur41s led to a relaxed root looping. As reported, the ion content (Na+, K+ and Fe2+), apoplast acidification ability, and salt tolerance were also abnormal in the quadruple mutants and/or the SAUR41 overexpression lines. Our work supports an emerging concept that ABA and calcium are integrated together to modulate ion homeostasis. In addition, our work demonstrates that SAUR41s might be new components for the regulation of ion homeostasis by ABA and calcium.

The study is to explore the effect of LBP on IL-1?-evoked ATDC5 cell inflammatory injury. Methods: ATDC5 cells were administrated with 10?ng/mL interleukin (IL)-1? to establish an in vitro model of cartilage damage. After management, cell viability was tested through CCK8 assay. The pro-inflammatory cytokines and cyclooxygenase (Cox)-2 were assessed through ELISA, western blot and qRT-PCR. MiR-124 expression in ATDC5 cells was silenced by transfecting with miR-124 inhibitor, and the pro-inflammatory cytokines and Cox-2 were re-assessed. NF-?B and JNK pathways were measured through western blot. Results: IL-1? stimulation accelerated the release of IL-1?, IL-6 and TNF-?, elevated Cox-2 expression. LBP significantly eased IL-1?-induced inflammation. MiR-124 expression was observed to enhance by LBP, and the impacts of LBP on ATDC5 cells were lightened via transfection with miR-124 inhibitor. NF-?B and JNK pathways were activated after IL-1? stimulation, nevertheless were inactivated by LBP administration. Besides, LBP-evoked the repression of NF-?B and JNK pathways were overturned by miR-124 inhibitor. Conclusions: Our study suggests that LBP protects ATDC5 cells from IL-1?-evoked injury through up-regulating miR-124 via blocking NF-?B and JNK pathways.
