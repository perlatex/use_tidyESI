J	Guo, C; Jiang, KZ; Zheng, S				Guo, Cheng; Jiang, Kezhi; Zheng, Shu			Fragmentation reactions of N-benzyltetrahydroquinolines in electrospray ionization mass spectrometry: the roles of ion/neutral complex intermediates	RAPID COMMUNICATIONS IN MASS SPECTROMETRY			English	Article							ION-NEUTRAL COMPLEXES; GAS-PHASE FRAGMENTATION; REARRANGEMENT; CHEMISTRY; COLLISION; DISSOCIATION; SPECTRUM; HYDRIDE; ANALOGS; KETONES	RATIONALEElectrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) combined with the collision-induced dissociation (CID) technique has assumed increasing importance as an invaluable tool for the structural analysis of organic and biological molecules. However, general rules for elucidating the fragmentation behaviors of charged molecules in the gas phase are still lacking. Therefore, explorations on the mechanistic information are desirable at all times. METHODSCID experiments of protonated N-benzyltetrahydroquinolines were carried out on ESI ion trap mass spectrometer and accurate mass measurements were performed on a high-resolution ESI quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-TOF) mass spectrometer in positive ion mode. RESULTSAn ion/neutral complex, [RC6H4CH2+/tetrahydroquinoline], resulting from cleavage of the C-N bond induced by the positive charge brought in by protonation, was proposed to be the intermediate to elucidate the fragmentation reactions. For all the compounds investigated, benzyl cation transfer, electron transfer and hydride transfer reactions mediated by the complex were observed. Moreover, for the compound substituted by a methyl group at the para-position of the benzylic phenyl ring, proton transfer reaction via the complex also occurs. CONCLUSIONSThis study is a case for better understanding the intriguing roles of ion/neutral complexes in gas-phase fragmentation reactions and enriching the knowledge about the gas-phase chemistry of the benzyl cation. In addition, it provides useful information for researchers working on analysis or structural elucidation of complicated compounds which contain the N-benzyltetrahydroquinoline substructure.

J	Gu, YM; Li, L; Zhou, C; Yang, TZ; Dong, HJ				Gu, Yaming; Li, Lu; Zhou, Chi; Yang, Tingzhong; Dong, Hengjin			Factors influencing voluntary premarital medical examination in Zhejiang province, China: a culturally-tailored health behavioral model analysis	BMC PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Premarital medical examination; Health belief model; Theory of reasoned action; Multilevel analysis model; Structural equation modeling; Marlowe-Crowne social desirability scale	BELIEF MODEL; SUBJECTIVE NORMS; BETWEEN-SUBJECTS; ATTITUDES; CANCER; INTENTIONS; PROGRAMS; PARTICIPATION; PERCEPTIONS; THALASSEMIA	Background: Premarital medical examination (PME) compliance rate has dropped drastically since it became voluntary in China in 2003. This study aimed to establish a prediction model to be a theoretic framework for analyzing factors affecting PME compliance in Zhejiang province, China. Methods: A culturally-tailored health behavioral model combining the Health Behavioral Model (HBM) and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) was established to analyze the data from a cross-sectional questionnaire survey (n = 2,572) using the intercept method at the county marriage registration office in 12 counties from Zhejiang in 2010. Participants were grouped by high (n = 1,795) and low (n = 777) social desirability responding tendency (SDRT) by Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale (MCSDS). A structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to evaluate behavioral determinants for their influences on PME compliance in both high and low SDRT groups. Results: 69.8% of the participants had high SDRT and tended to overly report benefits and underreport barriers, which may affect prediction accuracy on PME participation. In the low SDRT group, the prediction model showed the most influencing factor on PME compliance was behavioral intention, with standardized structural coefficients (SSCs) being 0.75 (P < 0.01), and the intention was positively determined by individual's attitude toward PME (SSCs = 0.48, P < 0.01) and subjective norms (SSCs = 0.22, P < 0.01) and negatively determined by perceived threat (SSCs = -0.08, P = 0.028). Attitudes and subjective norms were more crucial predictors for PME compliance than perceived threat (SSCs = 0.36, 0.269, and -0.06, respectively). County environmental factors played a role in PME compliance while less influential than behavioral determinates (16% vs. 84% in across factor variance partition coefficient). Conclusions: PME compliance might be influenced by demographic, behavioral, and social environmental factors. The verified prediction model was tested to be an effective theoretic framework for the prediction of factors affecting voluntary PME compliance. It also should be noted that internationally available behavioral theories and models need to be culturally tailored to adapt to particular populations. This study has provided new insights for establishing a theoretical model to understand health behaviors in China.

The basic idea is to replace the free Green's function in the tunneling self-energy diagram by an effective reduced propagator under the Born approximation. This simple modification has remarkable consequences. It not only recovers the exact results for quantum transport through noninteracting systems under arbitrary voltages, but also predicts the challenging nonequilibrium Kondo effect. Compared to the nonequilibrium Green's function technique that formulates the calculation of specific correlation functions, the master equation approach contains richer dynamical information to allow more efficient studies for such as the shot noise and full counting statistics.

In this work, the crystallization behaviors and physical properties of the PLLA/POM blends with the PLLA as the major component have been systematically studied. POM was crystallized into the fragment crystals that were finely dispersed in the PLLA matrix when cooling down from the melt of the blends. It was found that the POM fragment crystals accelerated the crystallization process of PLLA matrix and increased the final crystallinity of PLLA significantly in the blends. At the same time, the PLLA spherulites nucleated by POM fragment crystals were much smaller than those obtained from neat PLLA. It was further found that the crystallization rate of PLLA was quite dependent upon the POM loadings and the highest crystallization rate was observed at POM loadings of 7 wt %. It is considered that the POM fragment crystals take the nuclei role to initiate the crystallization of PLLA at low POM loadings, while a high content of POM in the blends leads to the large POM spherulites that cannot nucleate PLLA crystallization effectively. The obtained PLLA/POM blends at low POM loadings with small PLLA spherulites exhibited excellent optical transmittance and good mechanical performance.

Age-related variation in electrophoretic profiles was found in both species and proteolytic and fibrinogenolytic activity was higher in neonate than adult venoms. Neonate D. acutus venom had higher 5 ' nucleotidase, PLA(2), hyaluronidase and gelatinolytic activity, but lower esterolytic activity, than adult venom. Neonate and adult D. acutus venoms showed identical phosphomonoesterase, LAO and fibrinolytic activities. Neonate N. atra venom had higher phosphomonoesterase and LAO activity, but lower 5 ' nucleotidase, PLA(2), hyaluronidase and AchE activities than adult venom. Neonate and adult N. atra venoms showed similar gelatinolytic activity. Further, age-dependent immunoreactivity was found in both species, and cross-reactions between homologous venoms and antiserums were closely related to venom composition. We speculate that age-related variation in venom characteristics is possibly driven by evolutionary forces associated with ontogenetic shifts in dietary habits, competition and predation pressure.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(+) pi(-) and eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(0) pi(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							MASS; MESON	Using a sample of 1.3 x 10(9) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector, we report the first observation of eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(+) pi(-) and eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(0) pi(0). The measured branching fractions are B(eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(+) pi(-)) = [8.53 +/- 0.69(stat.) +/- 0.64(syst.)] x 10(-5) and B(eta' -> pi(+) pi(-) pi(0) pi(0)) = [1.82 +/- 0.35(stat.) +/- 0.18(syst.)] x 10(-4), which are consistent with theoretical predictions based on a combination of chiral perturbation theory and vector-meson dominance.

J	Ren, XL; Lu, LY; Liu, RR; Zhang, JL				Ren, Xiaolong; Lu, Linyuan; Liu, Runran; Zhang, Jianlin			Avoiding congestion in recommender systems	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						diffusion; heat conduction; information filtering; bipartite network; congestion; recommender systems	DIVERSITY	Recommender systems use the historical activities and personal profiles of users to uncover their preferences and recommend objects. Most of the previous methods are based on objects' (and/or users') similarity rather than on their difference. Such approaches are subject to a high risk of increasingly exposing users to a narrowing band of popular objects. As a result, a few objects may be recommended to an enormous number of users, resulting in the problem of recommendation congestion, which is to be avoided, especially when the recommended objects are limited resources. In order to quantitatively measure a recommendation algorithm's ability to avoid congestion, we proposed a new metric inspired by the Gini index, which is used to measure the inequality of the individual wealth distribution in an economy. Besides this, a new recommendation method called directed weighted conduction (DWC) was developed by considering the heat conduction process on a user-object bipartite network with different thermal conductivities. Experimental results obtained for three benchmark data sets showed that the DWC algorithm can effectively avoid system congestion, and greatly improve the novelty and diversity, while retaining relatively high accuracy, in comparison with the state-of-the-art methods.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of the branching fraction for psi(3686) -> omega K+K-	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							NARROW RESONANCE; DISCOVERY	With 1.06 x 10(8) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector, the branching fraction of psi(3686) -> omega K+K- is measured to be (1.54 +/- 0.04 +/- 0.11) x 10(-4). This is the most precise result to date, due to the largest psi(3686) sample, improved signal reconstruction efficiency, good simulation of the detector performance, and a more accurate knowledge of the continuum contribution. Using the branching fraction of J/psi -> omega K+K-, the ratio B(psi(3868) -> K+K-)/B(J/psi -> K+K-) is determined to be (18.4 +/- 3.7)%. This constitutes a significantly improved test of the 12% rule, with the uncertainty now dominated by the J/psi branching fraction.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G.

Recent studies have revealed that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling plays important roles in oligodendrocyte development and myelin formation. However, there are conflicting reports on the specific function of Wnt signaling components in oligodendrocyte specification and differentiation. In the present study, we demonstrate that activation of beta-catenin in neural progenitor cells before gliogenesis inhibits the generation of oligodendrocyte progenitors (OLPs) in mice. Once OLPs are formed, beta-catenin becomes necessary for oligodendrocyte differentiation. Disruption of beta-catenin signaling instead leads to a significant delay of oligodendrocyte maturation. These findings suggest that Wnt/beta-catenin pathway regulates oligodendrocyte development in a stage-dependent manner.

Fish immune cells are extremely vulnerable to NOD-induced oxidative stress. Oligomeric proanthocyanidin complex (OPC), extracted from grapeseed, was used as an antioxidant to eliminate reactive oxygen species and prevent apoptotic effects. Carassius auratus lymphocytes were treated with different concentrations (0, 10, 100, and 1000 mu g/L) of OPC and a constant dose (100 mu g/L) of NOD for 12h in vitro. OPC inhibited mitosis by decreasing intracellular levels of oxidative stress, regulating antioxidant enzymes (CAT, SOD, GPx, GR, and GST), mediating bcl-2 family proteins, and deactivating caspase-3. Glutathione (GSH) levels in group V (NOD 100 mu g/L; OPC 1000 mu g/L) showed a twofold increase compared with corresponding levels in group II (NOD 100 mu g/L). Structure parameters of NOD and NOD-GSH were calculated using SYBYL 7.1 software. ClogP and HINK logP values of NOD-GSH decreased by 10.4- and 2.3-fold, respectively, compared with corresponding values of NOD. OPC-stimulated GSH can lower the lipophilicity and polarity of NOD. OPC, as a protective agent, can alleviate NOD-induced toxicity in C. auratus lymphocytes by regulating oxidative stress and inducing NOD-GSH detoxification. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Via assigning degree-dependent weights onto links associated with the ground node, we proposed a variant to a recent ranking algorithm named LeaderRank (Lu et al., 2011). According to the simulations on the standard SIR model, the weighted LeaderRank performs better than LeaderRank in three aspects: (i) the ability to find out more influential spreaders; (ii) the higher tolerance to noisy data; and (iii) the higher robustness to intentional attacks.

J	Yang, G; Chen, B				Yang, Ge; Chen, Bin			Persistent spin current in mesoscopic antiferromagnet spin chain with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						DM interaction; Gauge invariant; Spin Current	REAL-SPACE OBSERVATION; WAVE THEORY; LATTICE	By using the modified spin-wave and gauge invariant methods, we show that at zero temperature in the presence of an inhomogeneous magnetic field with magnitude B gives rise to a persistent magnetization current around a mesoscopic antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin ring with the DM (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction. The results show that the persistent magnetization current is vanishing at large D-s/J (D-s is reduced DM interaction and J is nearest exchange coupling) with alpha > 1 (alpha is a constant describing the energy gap of the spin system). The result also shows that under the homogeneous magnetic field there exists a non-zero spin current in the spin ring. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Identified proteins were assigned to a few main toxin families. Disintegrin, phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)), serine proteinase, cysteine-rich secretory protein, C-type lectin-like protein, L-amino acid oxidase and snake venom metalloproteinase (SVMP) were detected in both venoms, while 5'-nucleotidase was detected only in the adult venom. SVMP was the predominant protein family in both venoms (neonate: 65.7%; adult: 64.4%), followed by PLA(2) (neonate: 13.4%; adult: 25.0%). Antivenomic analysis revealed that commercial G. brevicaudus antivenom almost neutralized the chromatographic peaks with medium and high molecular masses in both venoms, but did not completely recognize peaks with low molecular mass. Toxicological and enzymatic activities show remarkable age-related variation in G. brevicaudus venom, probably resulting from variation in venom composition. Our data demonstrate age-related variation across venomics, antivenomics and biochemical profiles of G. brevicaudus venom, and have implications for the management of G. brevicaudus bites, including improving antivenom preparation by combining both venoms. Biological significance This study investigates the composition and biochemical activity of neonate and adult Gloydius brevicaudus venoms. We found remarkable age-related variation in venom biological activity, likely the result of variation in venom composition. Antivenomics analysis was used to explore difference in neonate and adult G. brevicaudus venoms. Our findings have implications for the diagnosis and clinical management of G. brevicaudus bites, and the design of venom mixtures that will increase the efficacy of commercial antivenom.

The polymethacryloxypropylsilsesquioxanes-polyacrylate (PMPS-PA) latex particles were prepared through seeded emulsion polymerization using polymethacryloxypropylsilsesquioxanes (PMPS) as seed. As a reference, silica-polyacrylate (S-PA) latex particles were obtained with similar method. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy were used to characterize the chemical composition and morphology of the resultant hybrid particles. The results showed that PMPS-PA particles were uniformly spherical with core-shell morphology and possessed narrow size distribution, whereas S-PA hybrid particles were not uniform as PMPS-PA particles and had bimodal size distribution. The surface properties, optical properties and thermal stability of the corresponding films were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, UV-Vis spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. Comparatively, PMPS-PA film exhibited smoother surface, larger optical transmittance and better thermal stability than S-PA film. These could be attributed to PMPS that were chemically bonded with PA phases, whereas weak interactions between silica and PA phases in S-PA, where silica surface modification was usually required to increase the surface interactions. Thus, PMPS particles containing reactive carbon-carbon double bond could be prospective and be directly used as seeds in the following emulsion polymerization to prepare chemically bonded hybrid particles.

Compared to conventional organic solvent extractions, this newly proposed method was much easier, more sensitive, environmentally friendly, and effective as well. Several important parameters influencing the micellar extraction efficiency are discussed, such as selection of ILs, surfactant concentration, and extraction time. Under the optimal conditions, good linearity was achieved for each analyte with correlation coefficients (r(2)) ranging from 0.9934 to 0.9999, and the recovery values ranged from 89.3 to 106% with relative standard deviations lower than 5.5%. Results suggest that the IL-based one-step micellar extraction could be an alternative and promising means in future food analysis.

A response surface methodology (RSM) was chosen to optimize ultrasonication parameters according to specific ANAMMOX activity (SAA), and optimum conditions were attained at an ultrasound intensity (UI) of 0.7 W/cm(2) and an exposure time (ET) of 1.9 min. Compared with ET, Ul significantly affected the SAA. Dehydrogenase enzyme activity measured after ultrasonication was 61% higher compared to the control sludge not exposed to ultrasound. After ultrasound irradiation, the half-saturation constant decreased from 174.5 to 168.5 mgTN/L (TN represents total nitrogen), and the IC50 (half-maximal inhibitory concentration) decreased from 633.4 to 571.4 mgTN/L. The dehydrogenase enzyme activity and kinetic analysis of sludge after ultrasound irradiation confirmed that ultrasound treatment under optimal conditions increased sludge activity.

But in a multi-user surrounding, it may not be sufficient, because the adversary may corrupt some users to obtain the random coins as well as the plaintexts used to generate ciphertexts. The attack is named selective opening attack'. We study how to achieve full-fledged chosen-ciphertext security in selective opening setting directly from the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption. Our construction is actually a tag-based public-key encryption scheme free of chameleon hashing and has a tight security reduction to the Decisional Diffie-Hellman assumption and the collision-resistant assumption of hash functions. The tag for each ciphertext is generated in a flexible way to serve the chosen-ciphertext security proof in selective opening settings. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

The coupling is mediated by a large Josephson junction (JJ) and a flux qubit. The large JJ can be treated classically and behaves like an effective inductance to switch the coupling between the charge and flux qubits. The flux qubit serves as a bridge to couple the NVCE and the charge qubit, and quantum state transfer can be implemented, with the NVCE acting as a memory unit. The hybrid circuit can reinforce various advantages: controllability of the charge qubit and robust spin coherence of the NVCE.

To assess the association of dietary carbohydrate intake and dietary glycemic index (GI), and risk of age-related cataract (ARC), and quantitatively estimate their dose-response relationships. METHODS. We searched Medline, the Cochrane Library, Excerpta Medica database (EMBASE), Institute for Scientific Information (ISI) Science Citation Index, ISI Web of Knowledge, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases before October 2013. Two authors independently extracted data and assessed study quality. The random-effect model was used to calculate the pooled odds ratios (ORs). Dose-response analyses, subgroup analyses based on ARC subtypes, heterogeneity, and publication bias assessment were also carried out. RESULTS. Seven studies were included in our meta-analysis. The pooled ORs of ARC for the highest versus the lowest category of carbohydrate intake and GI were 1.18 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-1.38) and 1.15 (95% CI: 1.00-1.32), respectively. Further subgroup analyses based on ARC subtypes suggested a marginally significant association between higher carbohydrate intake and cortical cataract risk (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 0.99-1.90), and a statistically significant association between higher GI and nuclear cataract risk (OR: 1.23, 95% CI: 1.03-1.46). In addition, a significant dose-response relationship was observed between carbohydrate intake and the risk of cortical cataract. CONCLUSIONS. Our results indicate that higher dietary carbohydrate quantity and GI may be associated with the risk of cortical and nuclear cataract, respectively. The results should be interpreted cautiously and more studies are warranted to clarify this issue.

Our results generalize some known Turan type inequality both for polynomials and rational functions.

The exponential function transforms the Abbreviated Injury Scale, which both improves accuracy and simplifies scoring	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRAUMA AND EMERGENCY SURGERY			English	Article						Abbreviated Injury Scale; Exponential Injury Severity Score; Injury Severity Score; New Injury Severity Score; Prediction of mortality	SEVERITY SCORE; MORTALITY; CARE	We present here the exponential function which transforms the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS). It is called the Exponential Injury Severity Score (EISS), and significantly outperforms the venerable but dated New Injury Severity Score (NISS) and Injury Severity Score (ISS) as a predictor of mortality. The EISS is defined as a change of AIS values by raising each AIS severity score (1-6) by 3 taking a power of AIS minus 2 and then summing the three most severe injuries (i.e., highest AIS), regardless of body regions. EISS values were calculated for every patient in two large independent data sets: 3,911 and 4,129 patients treated during a 6-year period at the Class A tertiary hospitals in China. The power of the EISS to predict mortality was then compared with previously calculated NISS values for the same patients in each of the two data sets. We found that the EISS is more predictive of survival [Zhejiang: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): NISS = 0.932, EISS = 0.949, P = 0.0115; Liaoning: AUC: NISS = 0.924, EISS = 0.942, P = 0.0139]. Moreover, the EISS provides a better fit throughout its entire range of prediction (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic for Zhejiang: NISS = 21.86, P = 0.0027, EISS = 13.52, P = 0.0604; Liaoning: NISS = 23.27, P = 0.0015, EISS = 15.55, P = 0.0164). The EISS may be used as the standard summary measure of human trauma.	[Wang, M. D.; Fan, W.

However, there is a challenge for realizing the scalable preparation of the multi-scale CNT-glass fiber (CNT-GF) reinforcements in practical application. In this work, we present a simple and continuous method of the mass production of multiscale CNT-glass fiber (CNT-GF) reinforcements. Scanning electron microscopy and thermo gravimetric analysis indicated similar to 1.0 wt% CNTs were highly dispersed on the whole fiber surface through a facile surfactant-assisted process. Such hybrid CNT-GF fillers were found to effectively enhance the stiffness, strength and impact resistance of polypropylene polymer. Increased storage modulus, glass transition temperature and crystallization temperature of the composites filled with the CNT-GF fillers were also observed in the differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis compared with the composites containing the pristine GF fillers. Fracture surface analysis revealed enhanced interfacial quality between CNT-GF and matrix, which is likely responsible for improved performance of the hierarchical polymer composites.

Two branches of the low-lying excitation in both the absence and presence of magnetic field are obtained. The thermodynamic quantities (such as free energy, magnetization, specific heat and static magnetic susceptibility) are also evaluated at finite temperature. This is the first time to calculate the Ferrimagnetic spin chain by using Villain's method, and we find that the results at a low temperature are quite similar to the previous calculation. The results of free energy and magnetization in zero temperature suggest that the Villain transformation has a good efficiency.

Several studies have compared the efficacy of landiolol and placebo or other agents in preventing new-onset AF in patients after cardiac surgery. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether landiolol is effective in preventing new-onset AF after cardiac surgery. Methods and Results Five randomized controlled trials and two retrospective analyses were included in this study. The clinical outcomes of interest were the occurrence of AF after cardiac surgery and major complications. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.18 software, and pooled estimates of the effect were reported as risk ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The results of this meta-analysis indicate that landiolol is significantly associated with a decreased risk of occurrence of AF after cardiac surgery (RR= 0.33; 95% CI: 0.23-0.48; P < 0.00001) and is not associated with an increased risk of major complications (RR= 0.79; 95% CI: 0.43-1.45; P= 0.45) compared with the control group. Conclusion Landiolol administration in the perioperative period can reduce the occurrence of AF after cardiac surgery without increasing the risk of major complications. It can be used to prevent new-onset AF safely after cardiac surgery.

The adsorbed His-tagged proteins could be back-extracted from the IL phase to the aqueous buffer with an imidazole solution. The specific binding of His-tagged proteins with AIL/IL could be affected by a few factors including the ionic strength and coordinated metal ions. In the case of His-tagged enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), the maximum binding capacity of Cu2+-AIL/IL reached 2.58 mu g/mu mol under the optimized adsorption conditions. The eluted His-tagged EGFP kept fluorescent and remained active through the purification process. Moreover, a tandem extraction process successively using Cu2+-AIL/IL and Zn2+-AIL/IL systems was developed, which was proven very efficient to obtain the ultimate protein with a purity of about 90 %. An effective reclamation method for the AIL/IL extraction system was further established. The sorbent could be easily regenerated by removing metal ions with EDTA and the followed reimmobilization of metal ions. Easy handling of the presented M2+-AIL/IL system and highly specific ability to absorb His-tagged proteins make it attractive and potentially applicable in biomolecular separation.

Accumulating evidence prompts the view that telomere length in kidney tissue cells is an indicator for organismal aging. Previously identified aging markers (cathelin-related antimicrobial peptide (CRAMP), stathmin, elongation factor-1 alpha (EF-1 alpha), and chitinase) were associated not only with telomere driven aging in mice but also with human aging and chronic diseases. This study focuses on the relationship between these biomarkers and IgA nephropathy (IgAN) progression in the Chinese population. For 260 individuals, the four markers are determined in blind datasets using direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence staining. The expression levels of CRAMP and chitinase increased in blood plasma, urine, and kidney tissues during human IgAN progression. And for the other nephropathy, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), diabetic nephropathy (DN), and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), there is no protein upregulation with telomere shortening. Moreover, a combination of CRAMP and chitinase can distinguish patients with IgAN from healthy individuals with 88.2%/92.5% (plasma) and 74.3%/84.2% (urine) sensitivity/specificity. These data provide the experimental evidence that telomere shortening and related inflammatory proteins are associated with human IgAN, and it could be a new direction for the disease progression study.

The gate can be realized via one operational step, without need of classical pulses, and by a virtual photon process. Thus, the gate operation is greatly simplified and decoherence from the cavity decay is much reduced, when compared with previous proposals. In addition, the operation time is independent of the number of qubits and no adjustment of the qutrit level spacings or the cavity frequency is needed during the operation.

Gpr177-mediated Wnt Signaling is Required for Fungiform Placode Initiation	JOURNAL OF DENTAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Wntless; ShhCre; taste placode; fungiform papilla; canonical Wnt; tongue	TASTE PAPILLA DEVELOPMENT; MOUSE TONGUE; RAT TONGUE; ROLES; CELLS; SHH; DIFFERENTIATION; INNERVATION; SECRETION; PROTEINS	Fungiform papillae are formed as patterned rows on the surface of the anterior tongue at early organogenesis and contain one taste bud in each papilla to form one of the important sensory organs. Despite the essential role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in controlling the development of fungiform taste papillae, the universal function of Wnt ligands in the initiation of the fungiform placode has not been completely elucidated. Here, by Shh(Cre)-mediated oral epithelial deletion of Wntless (Gpr177), a regulator essential for intracellular Wnt trafficking, we demonstrate that an overall function of Wnts is required for initiation of the fungiform placode. Multiple Wnts are expressed in the tongue epithelium at E11.5 before initiation of the fungiform placodes. Epithelial Gpr177 loss-of-function, associated with reduction of canonical Wnt signaling in lingual epithelium as exhibited by a loss of TopGal activity and Axin2 expression, results in the failure of fungiform placode initiation, as assessed by diminished expression of several taste placode molecular markers. Moreover, LiCl treatment of Gpr177 epithelial-deficient tongue explants at E11.5, but not at E12.5, restores tongue placode formation, demonstrating that Wnt ligands in the tongue surface prior to but not after fungiform placode initiation are responsible for fungiform papilla initiation. Epithelium-specific expression of an active beta-catenin in the Gpr177-deficient tongue leads to fungiform papillae generation, suggesting that an intra-epithelial response to Wnts is required for placode initiation. Together, these results suggest that Gpr177 controls epithelial initiation of the fungiform placode through signaling via epithelial Wnt ligands.

We found spatial Stroop effects of similar size for the simple characters ("up") and ("down") and for the complex characters ("nervous") and ("nervous"), which are ideogrammic compounds containing a radical or, in Experiments 1 and 2. In Experiment 3, the spatial Stroop effects were also similar for the simple characters ("east") and ("west") and for the complex characters ("state") and ("spray"), which contain and as radicals. This outcome occurred regardless of whether the task was to identify the character (Exps. 1 and 3) or its location (Exp. 2). Thus, the spatial Stroop effect emerges in the processing of radicals just as it does for processing simple characters. This finding suggests that when reading ideogrammic compounds, (a) their radicals' meanings can be processed and (b) ideogrammic compounds have little or no influence on their radicals' semantic processing.

Frequent mixed infection and high rates of recombination and mutation allow them to adapt rapidly to new hosts and overcome hosts' resistances. Therefore, an effective strategy able to confer plants with resistance against multiple begomoviruses is needed. In the present study, artificial zinc finger proteins were designed based on a conserved sequence motif of begomoviruses. DNA-binding affinities and specificities of these artificial zinc fingers were evaluated using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Artificial zinc finger nuclease (AZFNs) were then constructed based on the ones with the highest DNA-binding affinities. In vitro digest and transient expression assay showed that these AZFNs can efficiently cleave the target sequence and inhibit the replication of different begomoviruses. These results suggest that artificial zinc finger protein technology may be used to achieve resistance against multiple begomoviruses.

In comparison with Speier's and Karstedt's catalysts, the platinum-acetylide-phosphine complexes exhibited both higher catalytic activity and selectivity for the -adduct for the hydrosilylation reactions under the same conditions. Furthermore, the complexes also exhibited a strong ability to resist to sulfur-poisoning.

Therefore, future QIP most likely will require quantum networks consisting of a large number of cavities, each hosting and coupled to multiple qubits. In this work, we propose a way to prepare a -class entangled state of spatially separated multiple qubits in different cavities, which are connected to a coupler qubit. Because no cavity photon is excited, decoherence caused by the cavity decay is greatly suppressed during the entanglement preparation. This proposal needs only one coupler qubit and one operational step, and does not require using a classical pulse, so that the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified. As an example of the experimental implementation, we further give a numerical analysis, which shows that high-fidelity generation of the state using three superconducting phase qubits each embedded in a one-dimensional transmission line resonator is feasible within the present circuit QED technique. The proposal is quite general and can be applied to accomplish the same task with other types of qubits such as superconducting flux qubits, charge qubits, quantum dots, nitrogen-vacancy centers, and atoms.

The snake is listed on the "Lists of terrestrial wildlife under state protection, which are beneficial or of important economic or scientific value" promulgated by China's State Forestry Administration in 2000. To develop some more effective conservation strategies for the snake, we need a better understanding of population structure and evolutionary history of this species through kinds of specific molecular markers such as microsatellites or short, tandemly repeated base-pair sequences. Here, we characterize 11 polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from E. taeniura genomic libraries. Forty-eight individuals were collected from Quanzhou population in Guangxi, China.

No locus exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci.

Short-term meditation induces changes in brain resting EEG theta networks	BRAIN AND COGNITION			English	Article						Brain complex networks; EEG; Integrative body-mind training; Relaxation training	GRAPH-THEORETICAL ANALYSIS; WHITE-MATTER CHANGES; MINDFULNESS; ATTENTION; ANTERIOR; MECHANISMS; EXPERIENCE; EFFICIENCY; EVALUATE; SCIENCE	Many studies have reported meditation training has beneficial effects on brain structure and function. However, very little is known about meditation-induced changes in brain complex networks. We used network analysis of electroencephalography theta activity data at rest before and after 1-week of integrative body-mind training (IBMT) and relaxation training. The results demonstrated the IBMT group (but not the relaxation group) exhibited significantly smaller average path length and larger clustering coefficient of the entire network and two midline electrode nodes (Fz and Pz) after training, indicating enhanced capacity of local specialization and global information integration in the brain. The findings provide the evidence for meditation-induced network plasticity and suggest that IBMT might be helpful for alterations in brain networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Glucose here acts as a multifunctional agent, not only as the reducing species to prepare MoO2, but also as the carbonaceous precursor and coating agent to form the carbon-coated and nanoscale MoO2 crystallines. The electrochemical tests demonstrate that the as-synthesized carbon-coated MoO2 nanocrystallines exhibit high capacity and excellent capacity retention as an anode material for lithium-ion batteries. The specific discharge capacity is as high as 790 mA h g(-1) in the first cycle and 730 mA h g(-1) over 50 cycles. The significant enhancement in the electrochemical Li storage performance is attributed to the synergistic effect of the nanocrystallines structure with small particle size and uniform carbon-coating shell, which reduces the diffusion distance for Li-ion and electron, provides high electric conductivity and relieves the volume effect during the cycling.

TEOG was impregnated into the pore space of porous carbon matrix and in situ converted to GeO2 under the help of the moisture in the air. Then the GeO2/C intermediate was reduced to Ge/C nanocomposite by H-2 treatment at 500 degrees C. This synthesis procedure does not involve the using of glove box or electrochemical cell, making it can be easily scaled up. The synthesized mesoporous Ge/C nanocomposite material displays good electrochemical properties with high reversible capacity (736 mAh/g) and stable cycle performance. The results indicate that the mesoporous Ge/C nanocomposite material can be a promising candidate for electrode material in lithium ion batteries. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Epoxide groups in EGMA-g-AS are ready to react with both PA11 and PLLA, and thus EGMA-g-AS could be manipulated to locate mainly in either PA11 phase or PLLA phase by variation of the blending sequence. It was found that the blend with salami structure in which EGMA-g-AS is predominantly dispersed in the PLLA phase provides not only significantly improved tensile ductility, but also excellent film impact strength, while keeping relatively high modulus. The elongation at break and the film impact strength of such materials with 6 phr EGMA-g-AS are 322% and 361 kJ m(-2), which are 78 and 5.2 times those of unmodified PLLA, respectively. In contrast, the blends with EGMA-g-AS mainly in the PA11 phase fracture in a brittle mode with low toughness. The toughening mechanism of the PLLA/PA11 blends with the sub-inclusion salami structure was investigated using a double-notch technique. The brittle-to-tough transition was observed on increasing the rubber sub-inclusion concentration in the PLLA phase.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study was approved by the local institutional review board and was HIPAA compliant. All participants provided written informed consent. Resting-state functional and structural magnetic resonance images were acquired in 52 patients with GTCS and 65 healthy control subjects. The functional connectivity between bilateral homotopic voxels was calculated. Homotopic regions showing abnormal functional connectivity in patients were adopted as regions of interest for an analysis of diffusion-tensor imaging tractography. The fractional anisotropy and fiber length were compared between groups. Two-sample t test and nonparametric correlation analysis were used. Results: Compared with control subjects, patients showed increased interhemispheric functional connectivity between the bilateral cuneus (P = .0008, corrected) and anterior cingulate cortex (P = .0003, corrected) and decreased functional connectivity between the bilateral olfactory cortex (P = .00005, corrected), inferior frontal gyrus (P = .00005, corrected), supramarginal gyrus (P = .0002, corrected), and temporal pole (P = .0003, corrected). Furthermore, the fiber length of the commissural fiber bundles connecting the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex (t = 22.30; P = .03, uncorrected) and the bilateral cuneus was shorter in patients than in control subjects (t = 23.19; P = .002, uncorrected). Conclusion: Our findings show that the bilateral anterior cingulate cortex may be critical to the pathophysiology of patients with GTCS and suggest that the corresponding commissural fiber bundle in the genu of the corpus callosum is a potential target for future surgical treatment in patients with intractable GTCS.

The Hg analytes (Hg+, MeHg, EtHg and Hg2+) were absorbed on the SAX column preconditioned with sodium 3-mercapto-1-propanesulfonate, and then rapidly eluted (less than 16 s) by 5 mu L 3% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol. The enrichment factors of 1025 for Hg+, 1084 for MeHg, 1108 for EtHg and 1046 for Hg2+ were obtained using 6 mL sample in a 1.5-min enrichment procedure. Rapid separation of the four mercurial compounds was achieved within 5 min on a 50-mm C-18 column using 0.5% (v/v) 2-mercaptoethanol as the mobile phase. The detection limits for Hg+, MeHg, EtHg and Hg2+ were 0.015, 0.010, 0.009 and 0.016 ng L-1, each, and the relative standard deviations of peak height and peak area (5 ng L-1 for each Hg species) were all below 5%. Mercury speciation in three freshwater, two drinking water and two seawater samples were then analyzed by the proposed method. MeHg and Hg2+ concentrations down to 0.14 and 0.56 ng L-1 were detected in the drinking waters. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study was designed to investigate whether inhalational exposure of concentrated PM2.5 in a genetically susceptible animal model would result in abnormalities in energy metabolism and exacerbation of peripheral glycemic control. Methods: KKay mice, which are susceptible to Type II DM, were assigned to either concentrated ambient PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 5-8 weeks via a whole body exposure system. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, oxygen consumption and heat production were evaluated. At euthanasia, blood, spleen and visceral adipose tissue were collected to measure inflammatory cells using flow cytometry. Standard immnunohistochemical methods, western blotting and quantitative PCR were used to assess targets of interest. Results: PM2.5 exposure influenced energy metabolism including O-2 consumption, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio and thermogenesis. These changes were accompanied by worsened insulin resistance, visceral adiposity and inflammation in spleen and visceral adipose depots. Plasma adiponectin were decreased in response to PM2.5 exposure while leptin levels increased. PM2.5 exposure resulted in a significant increase in expression of inflammatory genes and decreased UCP1 expression in brown adipose tissue and activated p38 and ERK pathways in the liver of the KKay mice. Conclusions: Concentrated ambient PM2.5 exposure impairs energy metabolism, concomitant with abnormalities in glucose homeostasis, increased inflammation in insulin responsive organs, brown adipose inflammation and results in imbalance in circulating leptin/adiponectin levels in a genetically susceptible diabetic model. These results provide additional insights into the mechanisms surrounding air pollution mediated susceptibility to Type II DM.

Local line binary pattern (LLBP) is a good oriented feature representation method extended from local binary pattern (LBP), but it is limited in that it can only extract horizontal and vertical line patterns, so effective information in an image may not be exploited and fully utilized. In this paper, an orientation-selectable LLBP method, called generalized local line binary pattern (GLLBP), is proposed for finger vein recognition. GLLBP extends LLBP for line pattern extraction into any orientation. To effectually improve the matching accuracy, the soft power metric is employed to calculate the matching score. Furthermore, to fully utilize the oriented features in an image, the matching scores from the line patterns with the best discriminative ability are fused using the Hamacher rule to achieve the final matching score for the last recognition. Experimental results on our database, MMCBNU_6000, show that the proposed method performs much better than state-of-the-art algorithms that use the oriented features and local features, such as LBP, LLBP, Gabor filter, steerable filter and local direction code (LDC).

Significant synergistic effects of MH and IFR have been observed for the TPV in terms of both flame retardant properties and mechanical performance. The mechanism of the synergistic effects has been investigated. The results indicate that a small amount of IFR accelerates the degradation of the matrix and induces a shrinkage matrix, leading to a compact and unbroken MgO protective layer. Such compact MgO layer on the surface of the material prevents the bulk material from further degradation, and a high flame retardant performance was achieved. Obviously, this novel flame retardant system paves new possibility for the high performance nonhalogen flame retardant polymeric materials and should also be applied to other polymers.

Also, in the catalytic alkynylation of aromatic aldehydes with terminal alkynes, the combination of these Ar-BINMOL-Phos ligands with dimethylzinc was found to be an effective catalyst system to afford predominantly the S-configured propargylic alcohols, whereas the additional use of calcium hydride and n-butyllithium along with the same Ar-BINMOL-Phos ligands gave the R-configured products in high yields and excellent enantioselectivities (up to >99% ee).

Several parameters affecting NACE separation were studied including the MWNT concentration, the electrolyte concentration, pH* and the separation voltage. In comparison to conventional NACE, the addition of an MWNT dispersion using surfactant solutions in the electrolyte produced an important enhancement in the resolution due to the pi-pi interactions between the analytes and the surface of the carbon nanotubes. Using SC-MWNTs (6 mu g mL(-1)) as a PSP in the background electrolyte (BGE) (i.e., 20mM sodium acetate in methanol-acetonitrile (80:20, v/v)) provided the complete separation of five alkaloids. Finally, the developed method has been successfully applied to the detection and quantification of the tested compounds of Rhizoma Coptidis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of electromagnetic Dalitz decays J/psi -> Pe(+)e(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							TRANSITION FORM-FACTORS; OMEGA; MESON; PAIR; PHI	Based on a sample of (225.3 +/- 2.8) x 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector, the electromagnetic Dalitz decays of J/psi -> Pe(+)e(-)(P = eta'/eta/pi(0)) are studied. By reconstructing the pseudoscalar mesons in various decay modes, the decays J/psi -> eta'e(+)e(-), J/psi -> eta e(+)e(-), and J/psi -> pi(0)e(+)e(-) are observed for the first time. The branching fractions are determined to be B(J/psi -> eta'e(+)e(-)) = (5.81 +/- 0.16 +/- 0.31) x 10(-5), B(J/psi -> eta e(+)e(-)) = (1.16 +/- 0.07 +/- 0.06) x 10(-5), and B(J/psi -> pi(0)e(+)e(-)) = (7.56 +/- 1.32 +/- 0.50) x 10(-7), where the first errors are statistical and the second ones systematic.

An incubation experiment was conducted to investigate impacts of six biochars on N balance and retention in paddy soils. Nitrogen balance is the changes of soil N contents before and after experiment, whereas N retention is the difference of soil N losses with and without biochar. Results showed total N and nitrate (NO3-N) contents in soils were enhanced with the increase of biochar levels, whereas NH4-N decreased. The biochar-scaled N retention potential (N retention divided by biochar level) was reduced with increase of biochar level. Given that soil total N and NO3-N balance was zero and NH4-N balance decreased by 30%, the optimum levels of biochar were 5 g kg1 for LB500 and BCB600, 10 g kg(-1) for LB600, BCB500, and RSB500, and 30 g kg(-1) for RSB600, respectively. This research highlights a simple N balance assessment can optimize biochar amendment.

For the focal submanifolds with g = 6, the present paper obtains estimates on all the eigenvalues, among others, giving an affirmative answer in one case to the problem posed in [23], which may be regarded as a generalization of Yau's conjecture. In two of the four unsettled cases in [23] for focal submanifolds M-1 of OT-FKM-type, we prove the first eigenvalues to be their respective dimensions. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The phase structure, morphology and optical property of the obtained sample were characterized. SEM demonstrated that the flowerlike structures consisted of multilayered petals, which were wholly comprised of ZnO rods. XRD analysis confirmed patterns for the wurtzite hexagonal phase of ZnO and ACF from the sample. The formation mechanism of the flowerlike ZnO grown on ACF was also discussed. The ZnO/ACF composite showed a superior photocatalytic activity in the degradation of methyl orange as compared with pure ZnO. The enhancement was attributed to a red shift, stronger UV light absorption ability and higher absorption behavior in ZnO/ACF, and the capture and transportation of photogenerated electrons by ACF.

In this paper, we design a greedy link removal algorithm and find that many links in networks are actually redundant for synchronization, i.e. the synchronizability of the network is hardly affected if these links are removed. Our analysis shows that homogeneous networks generally have more redundant links than heterogeneous networks. We denote the reduced network with the minimum number of links to preserve synchronizability (eigenratio of the Laplacian matrix) of the original network as the synchronization backbone. Simulating the Kuramoto model, we confirm that the network synchronizability is effectively preserved in the backbone. Moreover, the topological properties of the original network and backbone are compared in detail. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, the mechanisms underlying the onset and control of chiral symmetry are largely understudied. We investigate possibility of chirality control in a chemical excitable system (the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction) by application of a chiral (rotating) electric field using the Oregonator model. We find that unlike previous findings, we can achieve the chirality control not only in the field rotation direction, but also opposite to it, depending on the field rotation frequency. To unravel the mechanism, we further develop a comprehensive theory of frequency synchronization based on the response function approach. We find that this problem can be described by the Adler equation and show phase-locking phenomena, known as the Arnold tongue. Our theoretical predictions are in good quantitative agreement with the numerical simulations and provide a solid basis for chirality control in excitable media. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

However, little is known about whether the functional connectivity of the low-level perceptual and higher-order cognitive (attention, central-execution, and default-mode) networks change in medication-naive PTSD patients during the resting state. Methods: We investigated the resting state networks (RSNs) using independent component analysis (ICA) in 18 chronic Wenchuan earthquake-related PTSD patients versus 20 healthy survivors (HSs). Results: Compared to the HSs, PTSD patients displayed both increased and decreased functional connectivity within the salience network (SN), central executive network (CEN), default mode network (DMN), somato-motor network (SMN), auditory network (AN), and visual network (VN). Furthermore, strengthened connectivity involving the inferior temporal gyrus (ITG) and supplementary motor area (SMA) was negatively correlated with clinical severity in PTSD patients. Limitations: Given the absence of a healthy control group that never experienced the earthquake, our results cannot be used to compare alterations between the PTSD patients, physically healthy trauma survivors, and healthy controls. In addition, the breathing and heart rates were not monitored in our small sample size of subjects. In future studies, specific task paradigms should be used to reveal perceptual impairments. Conclusions: These findings suggest that PTSD patients have widespread deficits in both the low-level perceptual and higher-order cognitive networks. Decreased connectivity within the low-level perceptual networks was related to clinical symptoms, which may be associated with traumatic reminders causing attentional bias to negative emotion in response to threatening stimuli and resulting in emotional dysregulation.

Previously, using a proteomic approach, we have shown that exposure to cisplatin can induce PSPC1 expression in HeLa cells, indicating the possible involvement for PSPC1 in the DNA damage response (DDR). In the current study, the role of PSPC1 in DDR was examined. First, it was found that cisplatin treatment could indeed induce the expression of PSPC1 protein. Abolishing PSPC1 expression by siRNA significantly inhibited cell growth, caused spontaneous cell death, and increased DNA damage. However, PSPC1 did not colocalize with gamma H2AX, 53BP1, or Rad51, indicating no direct involvement in DNA repair pathways mediated by these molecules. Interestingly, knockdown of PSPC1 disrupted the normal cell cycle distribution, with more cells entering the G2/M phase. Furthermore, while cisplatin induced G1/S arrest in HeLa cells, knockdown of PSPC1 caused cells to escape the G1/S checkpoint and enter mitosis, and resulted in more cell death. Taken together, these observations indicate a new role for PSPC1 in maintaining genome integrity during the DDR, particularly in the G1/S checkpoint.

The development of lateral root primordium (LRP) in Arabidopsis, which has a tap root system with simple radial structure of primary root, has been well characterized. However, limited knowledge has been acquired on the plants with fibrous root system, such as rice. This is mainly due to their multiple cell layers coated on root, which disturb the observation of LRP. Results: We used an easy and quick method to strip the epidermal and cortex tissues of primary root so that the LRP can be easily observed under microscope. In this way, we observed the developmental processes of LRP in rice. In addition, we described the expression dynamics of several root development related genes, especially OsPINs (PIN-FORWMED), during the process of LRP development. Conclusions: We reported an easy and quick method for LRP observation in rice and suggested a "fountain" model of auxin transport in LRP of rice, which is similar with that in Arabidopsis.

Developmental Changes in the Role of Different Metalinguistic Awareness Skills in Chinese Reading Acquisition from Preschool to Third Grade	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PHONOLOGICAL AWARENESS; MORPHOLOGICAL AWARENESS; CHARACTER ACQUISITION; SCHOOL-CHILDREN; PRINT EXPOSURE; HONG-KONG; DYSLEXIA; VOCABULARY; ENGLISH; KNOWLEDGE	The present study investigated the relationship between Chinese reading skills and metalinguistic awareness skills such as phonological, morphological, and orthographic awareness for 101 Preschool, 94 Grade-1, 98 Grade-2, and 98 Grade-3 children from two primary schools in Mainland China. The aim of the study was to examine how each of these metalinguistic awareness skills would exert their influence on the success of reading in Chinese with age. The results showed that all three metalinguistic awareness skills significantly predicted reading success. It further revealed that orthographic awareness played a dominant role in the early stages of reading acquisition, and its influence decreased with age, while the opposite was true for the contribution of morphological awareness. The results were in stark contrast with studies in English, where phonological awareness is typically shown as the single most potent metalinguistic awareness factor in literacy acquisition. In order to account for the current data, a three-stage model of reading acquisition in Chinese is discussed.

Magnetic properties of single-phase MnBi grown from MnBi49 melt	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	58th Annual Conference on Magnetism and Magnetic Materials	NOV 04-08, 2013	Denver, CO				TEMPERATURE-DEPENDENCE; ANISOTROPY; MANGANESE	The single-phase NiAs-type MnBi, embedded in Bi matrix, was grown from homogeneous MnBi49 melt at low temperatures to prevent the formation of Mn1.08Bi. An abrupt magnetization change was observed at similar to 240 K. The origin of this change was ascribed to the movement of the Mn atoms between the regular sites and the interstitial sites in the MnBi lattices. The splitting of the x-ray photoelectron lines of MnBi indicates the presence of two binding states of Mn atoms, one of which was ascribed to interstitial Mn atoms. A large coercivity up to 1.79 T at 400 K was observed in the as-grown bulk isotropic MnBi alloys. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Xiao, X. F.; Si, P. Z.; Feng, H.; Yu, S. J.; Ge, H.

Paraxial propagation of partially coherent anomalous hollow beams in uniaxial crystals orthogonal to the optical axis is investigated based on the beam propagation equations. The propagation properties of partially coherent anomalous hollow beams in uniaxial crystals and in free space are studied numerically and comparatively. It is found that the propagation properties of partially coherent anomalous hollow beams in uniaxial crystals behave very differently from those in free space and are closely determined by the parameters of the uniaxial crystals and the initial coherence width. The uniaxial crystals provide an effective way for generating astigmatic beams.

The tests and confidence intervals for the reliability parameter are developed using the concepts of generalized p-value and generalized confidence interval. Furthermore, some simulation results are presented to compare the performances between the proposed approach and the existing approach. For balanced models, the simulation results indicate that the proposed approach can provide satisfactory coverage probabilities and performs better than the existing approaches across the wide array of scenarios, especially for small sample sizes. For unbalanced models, the simulation results show that the two proposed approaches perform more satisfactorily than the existing approach in most cases. Finally, the proposed approaches are illustrated using two real examples.

Here, using immunohistochemistry, we present a comparative analysis of the spatiotemporal expression pattern of POU4F1, POU4F2, and ISL1 during the development of cochleovestibular ganglion (CVG) neurons in mouse inner ear. At early stages, when otic neurons are first detected in the otic epithelium (OE) and migrate into periotic mesenchyme to form the CVG, POU4F1 and ISL1 are co-expressed in a majority of the delaminated CVG neurons, which are marked by NEUROD1 expression, but POU4F1 is absent in the otic epithelium. The onset of POU4F2 expression starts after that of POU4F1 and ISL1, and is observed in the NEUROD1-negative, post-mitotic CVG neurons. When the CVG neurons innervate the vestibular and cochlear sensory organs, the expression of POU4F1, POU4F2, and ISL1 continues in both vestibular and spiral ganglion cells. Later in development, POU4F1 expression becomes down-regulated in a majority of spiral ganglion (SG) neurons and more neurons express POU4F2 expression while ISL1 expression is maintained. The differential as well as overlapping expression of POU4F1, POU4F2, and ISL1 combined with previous studies suggests possible functional interaction and regulatory relationship of these transcription factors in the development of inner ear neurons.

Exact and Adaptive Signed Distance Fields Computation for Rigid and Deformable Models on GPUs	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VISUALIZATION AND COMPUTER GRAPHICS			English	Article						Distance fields; GPU; Octree; bounding volume hierarchies; physics simulation	OPERATIONS; COLLISION	Most techniques for real-time construction of a signed distance field, whether on a CPU or GPU, involve approximate distances. We use a GPU to build an exact adaptive distance field, constructed from an octree by using the Morton code. We use rectangle-swept spheres to construct a bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) around a triangulated model. To speed up BVH construction, we can use a multi-BVH structure to improve the workload balance between GPU processors. An upper bound on distance to the model provided by the octree itself allows us to reduce the number of BVHs involved in determining the distances from the centers of octree nodes at successively lower levels, prior to an exact distance query involving the remaining BVHs. Distance fields can be constructed 35-64 times as fast as a serial CPU implementation of a similar algorithm, allowing us to simulate a piece of fabric interacting with the Stanford Bunny at 20 frames per second.

The objective of this study was to describe the surgical technique of LGCP and validate the efficacy and safety of LGCP for the treatment of obesity in obese Chinese patients with a relatively low body mass index (BMI). Methods: Twenty-two obese patients (mean age 33.8 +/- 6.0 years; mean BMI 37.0 +/- 7.0 kg/m(2)) underwent LGCP between September 2011 and September 2012. After dissecting the greater omentum and short gastric vessels, the gastric greater curvature plication with 2 rows of non-absorbable suture was performed under the guidance of a 32-F bougie. The data were collected during follow-up examinations performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results: All procedures were performed laparoscopically. The mean operative time was 84.1 minutes (50-120 min), and the mean length of hospital stay was 3.8 days (2-10 d). There were no deaths or postoperative major complications that needed reoperation. The mean percentage of excess weight loss (% EWL) was 22.9% +/- 6.9%, 38.6% +/- 9.8%, 51.5% +/- 13.5%, and 61.1% +/- 15.9% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. At 6 months, type 2 diabetes was in remission in 2 (50%) patients, hypertension in 1 (33.3%) patient, and dyslipidemia in 11 (78.6%) patients. Decreases in the index for homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and in insulin and glucose concentrations were observed. Conclusions: The early outcomes of LGCP as a novel treatment for obese Chinese with a relatively low BMI are satisfactory with respect to the effectiveness and low incidence of major complications. Additional long-term follow-up and prospective, comparative trials are still needed. (C) 2014 American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. All rights reserved.

High prevalence of early childhood infection by Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus in a minority population in China	CLINICAL MICROBIOLOGY AND INFECTION			English	Article						China; Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus; seroprevalence; Xinjiang	HUMAN-HERPESVIRUS-8 INFECTION; RISK-FACTORS; SEXUAL TRANSMISSION; NEUTRALIZING ANTIBODIES; UNITED-STATES; BLOOD-DONORS; VIRUS; XINJIANG; SEROPREVALENCE; CHILDREN	In China, KSHV seroprevalence varies considerably among different regions and ethnicities. But in Xinjiang province, located in the northwestern China, there is a very high seroprevalence of KSHV in adults of Kazak and Ughur ethnicities. However, KSHV prevalence in children and the risk factors associated with the acquisition of infection are currently not known. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of KSHV infection and identify associated socioeconomic or behavioural risk factors and the humoral immune response among children in this population. This is a cross-sectional study (N = 178) to screen children and their caregivers from Xinjiang for total KSHV antibodies, KSHV neutralizing antibodies and HIV infection. Structured questionnaires were utilized to investigate risk factors associated with KSHV prevalence. KSHV seroprevalence in children and caregivers in Xinjiang was 48.3% and 64.7%, respectively. Neutralizing antibody was detected in most seropositive caregivers (93.8%) but was detected in only 5.8% of the infected children. A significant association was observed between child KSHV seroprevalence and sharing of food among family members. These results suggest that similar to other endemic areas in Africa, KSHV infection in the minority populations of Xinjiang is likely to be occurring during early childhood, probably via horizontal transmission through saliva, and results in high seroprevalence in the adult population.

Mutations in the WRN gene results in the development of Werner syndrome (WS), a rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized by premature ageing and genome instability. In the present study, it was identified that XLF protein levels were lower in WRN-deficient fibroblasts, compared with normal fibroblasts. Depletion of WRN in He La cells led to a decrease of XLF mRNA and its promoter activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that WRN was associated with the XLF promoter. Depletion of XLF in normal human fibroblasts increased the percentage of (beta-galactosidase (beta-gal) staining-positive cells, indicating acceleration in cellular senescence. Taken together, the results suggest that XLF is a transcriptional target of WRN and may be involved in the regulation of cellular senescence.

These can be indirectly measured with resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and functional connectivity can be inferred as the spatiotemporal correlations of this signal. This technique has proliferated in recent years and has allowed the noninvasive investigation of large-scale, distributed functional networks. In this review, we give a brief overview of resting-state networks and examine the use of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging in neurosurgical contexts, specifically with respect to neurooncology, epilepsy surgery, and deep brain stimulation. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages compared with task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging, the limitations of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and the emerging directions of this relatively new technology.

PTEN hypermethylation profiles of Chinese Kazakh patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma	DISEASES OF THE ESOPHAGUS			English	Article						esophageal carcinoma; MALDI-TOF; promoter methylation; PTEN gene	PROMOTER HYPERMETHYLATION; DNA METHYLATION; MASS-SPECTROMETRY; CANCER; GENE; PROGRESSION; MECHANISMS; PATTERNS	Aberrant DNA methylation of promoter region CpG islands may serve as an alternative mechanism to genetic defects in the inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in human malignancies. The aim of this study was to examine the promoter methylation status of the PTENTSG and its association with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) carcinogenesis in a Chinese Kazakh population, which is known to have a relatively high ESCC incidence and mortality. The methylation status of the PTEN promoter region was determined in patients with ESCC (n = 95) and healthy individuals (n = 65) using highly sensitive Sequenom Epityper assays. The methylation level of the PTEN gene was significantly higher in patients with ESCC than in healthy controls. The median methylation level was 10.0% (interquartile range [IQR]: 7.0-11.0%) in patients with ESCC and 6.0% in controls (IQR: 4.0-9.0%; P = 0.001). PTEN methylation levels were higher in male patients with ESCC than in male controls, whereas a trend toward significance was observed between female patients with ESCC and female controls (P = 0.005 and P = 0.086, respectively). The PTEN methylation level was associated with histopathological grade and lymph node metastasis in patients with ESCC (P = 0.002 and P = 0.009, respectively). To our knowledge, this is the first report to show the presence of PTEN promoter CpG hypermethylation in ESCC and its association with tumor metastasis.	[Pan, Q. F.; Li, W. T.; Dong, H. C.; Chen, Y.

By tailoring the additive dosage and the pyrolysis temperature, correlations between the structure, composition, and electrochemical performance of SN-G were systematically elucidated. To our excitement, the SN3-G sample pyrolyzed at 900 degrees C with a dominant oxidized sulfur content exhibited striking electrocatalytic activity in alkaline medium, which was free from the crossover effect, and its long-term durability was superior to that of commercial Pt/C (20wt%). Furthermore, oxidized sulfur that was reported to be chemically inactive for the ORR was proven to be active, which was supported by both experimental results and density functional theory calculations.

The impact of safety and quality of health care on Chinese nursing career decision-making	JOURNAL OF NURSING MANAGEMENT			English	Article						China; nursing; quality; safety; voluntary leaving; work value	VOLUNTARY TURNOVER; JOB-SATISFACTION; NURSES; WORK; INTENTIONS; PATIENT; MODEL; SHORTAGE; CULTURE; TIME	AimThe aim of the study was to understand why nurses leave nursing practice in China by exploring the process from recruitment to final exit. This report examines the impact of safety and quality of health care on nursing career decision-making from the leavers' perspective. BackgroundThe nursing shortage in China is more serious than in most developed countries, but the loss of nurses through voluntarily leaving nursing practice has not attracted much attention. MethodThis qualitative study draws on a grounded theory approach. In-depth interviews with 19 nurses who have left nursing practice and were theoretically sampled from one provincial capital city in Mainland China. FindingLoss of confidence in the safety and quality of health care' became one of the main categories from all leavers' accounts of their decision to leave nursing practice. It emerged from three themes Perceiving risk in clinical practice', Recognising organisational barriers to safety' and Failing to meet expectations of patients'. DiscussionThe findings indicate that the essential work value of nursing to the leavers is the safety and quality of care for their patients. When nurses perceived that they could not fulfil this essential work value in their nursing practice, some of them could not accept the compromise to their value of nursing and left voluntarily to get away from the physical and mental stress. However, some nurses had to stay and accept the limitations on the safety and quality of health care. ConclusionThe study suggests that well-qualified nurses voluntarily leaving nursing practice is a danger signal for patients and hospitals, and has caused deterioration in nursing morale for both current and potential nursing workforces. It suggests that safety and quality of health care could be improved when individual nurses are empowered to exercise nursing autonomy with organisational and managerial support. Implications for nursing managementThe priority retention strategies need to remove organisational barriers to the safety and quality of health care. Under the current nursing shortage, Chinese hospital managers might consider recruiting nurses and care assistants of different educational levels, which would effectively improve nursing team work and support nurses' to stay and actively achieve their work values for the safety and quality of health care.

To study the synthesis and degradation of trehalose, which is hydrolyzed to glucose by trehalase, two soluble trehalase cDNAs of the beetle Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) (HaTreh1-1 and HaTreh1-2) were cloned. The HaTreh mRNA expression levels were higher during the larval than adult stages. The locomotory behavior of the beetle and its mRNA expression of HaTreh1-1 and HaTreh1-2 under starvation were then investigated. Sprint speed and maximum moving distance were increased, and the pause frequency decreased in H. axyridis adults starved for 8 h compared with control (0 h) adults. In contrast, the mRNA expression of both HaTrehs increased quickly in adults starved from 8 to 18 h, with HaTreh1-1 in particular being expressed 289-fold in adults starved for 18 h versus control. These results show that stored food reserves can provide energy to sustain vital activities for 8 h in H. axyridis adults. However, the beetles require trehalose and other energy sources to provide energy to find food and for vital activities when starved for more than 8 h.

The Spodoptera exigua Fox (SeFox) encodes a protein of 353 amino acids with a theoretical molecular mass of approximately 38.99 kDa and an isoelectric point of 8.86. qPCR results revealed that SeFox was expressed mainly in the brain, fat body, epidermis, midgut, Malpighian tubules, and testis. SeFox was expressed, with some changes, throughout development in the fat body and whole body. Injection of dsSeFox (SeFox dsRNA) into larvae resulted in incidences of albino plus molting deformity (4.8%), molting deformity (26.2%), and albino phenotypes (69.1%). dsSeFox injection resulted in approximately 50% knockdown of transcript levels at 36 h. Compared with control groups, hexokinase (HK) expression was reduced to approximately 40% at 48 h postinjection. Chitin synthase A (CHSA) expression was reduced to two-thirds at 24 h, but increased at 72 h. Compared with untreated control and green fluorescent protein-treated groups, Chitin synthase B (CHSB) expression decreased to 33% following dsSeFox injection by 36 h. We infer from our results that forkhead transcription factors act in chitin synthesis in S. exigua.

PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; ACHENE MICROMORPHOLOGY; CHINA; ZHEJIANG; TAXONOMY; GUANGXI; JAPAN	The sectional delimitation of Carex section Rhomboidales sensu Kukenthal (1909) is problematic and, here, we provide contributions to a systematic understanding of nutlet micromorphology in section Rhomboidales. Nutlet micromorphology of 87 samples representing 71 taxa was investigated using scanning electron microscopy and nine nutlet types were recognized. Although some closely related taxa show similarities, nutlet morphology in section Rhomboidales is stable at the species level and is reliable for species identification. Based on the nutlet characters, section Rhomboidales is delimited and emended as having nutlet rhombic-ovoid, trigonous; beaks conspicuous, erect, rarely curved or coiled; periclinal walls of epidermal cells straight, with zero to two silica bodies. The species with nutlets of the C. harlandii-type and C. thibetica-type are included, and species of the C. chinensis-type and C. macrandrolepsis-type are ascribed to section Mitratae and section Infossae, respectively. Carex longirostrata and C. pseudolongirostrata (= C. nodaeana), formerly ascribed to section Careyanae or section Depauperatae, are well supported as members of section Rhomboidales.

In this study, a double haploid population derived from the cross between japonica CJ06 and indica TN1 was used to analyze the quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for amylose content, gel consistency (GC), gelatinization temperature (GT), protein content, and grain hardness under two different conditions. A total of 18 QTLs were detected on chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 10, and 12, with the additive heritability ranging from 10.4 to 66.3 %. Eight of them were identified both in Hangzhou and Hainan. Moreover, five-locus epistatic interactions were identified except for GC, and two QTLs for GT exhibited environmental interaction effects. The results facilitate further understanding of the genetic basis for eating and cooking quality, nutritive quality, and milling quality.

More specifically, using the empirical analysis and modeling studies, we find that the spatio-temporal network that connects the cities with human cases along the order of outbreak timing emerges two-regime-power-law edge-length distribution, indicating the picture that several islands with higher and heterogeneous risk straggle in East China. The proposed method is applicable to the analysis of the spreading situation in the early stage of disease outbreak using quite limited dataset. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We find that with the increase of the absolute value of the phase, the chaotic behaviors of the coupled arrays may be controlled and different synchronized patterns can be induced. These results demonstrate that by introducing the randomness of the phase directions, rather than the continuous value of the phase, it can lead to a synchronization in nonlinear systems. This finding may provide a new insight for understanding the mechanism of disorder induced synchronization.

To co-deliver hydrophobic drug and functional gene efficiently into tumor cells, a star-shaped copolymer (PP-PLLD-Arg) with a photochemical internalization effect consisting of a porphyrin (PP) core and arginine-functionalized poly(L-lysine) dendron (PLLD-Arg) arms has been designed, and used to co-deliver docetaxel (DOC) and MMP-9 shRNA plasmid for nasopharyngeal cancer therapy. It was found that PP-PLLD-Arg/MMP-9 nanocomplex showed the photo-enhanced gene transfection efficiency in vitro, and could mediate a significant reduce of MMP-9 protein expression in HNE-1 cells. For co-delivery analysis, the obtained PP-PLLD-Arg/DOC/MMP-9 complexes could induce a more significant apoptosis than DOC or MMP-9 used only, and decreased invasive capacity of HNE-1 cells. Moreover, the star-shaped copolymer exhibited better blood compatibility and lower cytotoxicity compared to PEI-25k in the hemolysis and MTT assays, and also showed a good biocompatibility in vivo. Therefore, PP-PLLD-Arg with suited irradiation is a promising non-toxic and photo-inducible effective drug and gene delivery strategy, which should be encouraged in tumor therapy.

However, the functional implications of these resting-state abnormalities remain unclear. Recent findings in healthy subjects have revealed a close overlap between the neural substrate of self-referential processing and the resting-state activity in cortical midline regions. As such, we investigated task-related neural activity during active self-referential processing and various measures of resting-state activity in 11 patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) and 12 healthy control subjects. Overall, the results revealed that DOC patients exhibited task-specific signal changes in anterior and posterior midline regions, including the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). However, the degree of signal change was significantly lower in DOC patients compared with that in healthy subjects. Moreover, reduced signal differentiation in the PACC predicted the degree of consciousness in DOC patients. Importantly, the same midline regions (PACC and PCC) in DOC patients also exhibited severe abnormalities in the measures of resting-state activity, that is functional connectivity and the amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations. Taken together, our results provide the first evidence of neural abnormalities in both the self-referential processing and the resting state in midline regions in DOC patients. This novel finding has important implications for clinical utility and general understanding of the relationship between the self, the resting state, and consciousness.

Conventional cropping models suffer from the following three challenges. First, the deemphasized role of semantic contents that are many times more important than low-level features in photo aesthetics. Second, the absence of a sequential ordering in the existing models. In contrast, humans look at semantically important regions sequentially when viewing a photo. Third, the difficulty of leveraging inputs from multiple users. Experience from multiple users is particularly critical in cropping as photo assessment is quite a subjective task. To address these challenges, this paper proposes semantics-aware photo cropping, which crops a photo by simulating the process of humans sequentially perceiving semantically important regions of a photo. We first project the local features (graphlets in this paper) onto the semantic space, which is constructed based on the category information of the training photos. An efficient learning algorithm is then derived to sequentially select semantically representative graphlets of a photo, and the selecting process can be interpreted by a path, which simulates humans actively perceiving semantics in a photo. Furthermore, we learn a prior distribution of such active graphlet paths from training photos that are marked as aesthetically pleasing by multiple users. The learned priors enforce the corresponding active graphlet path of a test photo to be maximally similar to those from the training photos. Experimental results show that: 1) the active graphlet path accurately predicts human gaze shifting, and thus is more indicative for photo aesthetics than conventional saliency maps and 2) the cropped photos produced by our approach outperform its competitors in both qualitative and quantitative comparisons.

Full-thickness excisional and burn wounds were prepared on the backs of pigs and then treated with the BDE and J-1 ADM. Biopsy specimens were harvested on days 7, 14, and 21 after surgery for gross, biochemical, and molecular examinations. In comparison with the burn wounds, the excisional wounds showed accelerated granular tissue formation and superior integration with the equivalents, regardless of their type. Immunohistochemical, immunofluorescence, real time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and Western blotting analyses showed that the vascularization rates in the excisional wounds group were also significantly faster than those of the burn group for both dermal equivalents. There was no significant difference between J-1 ADM and BDE treatment on the formation of newly formed blood vessels for the excisional wounds at days 7, 14, and 21. However, there was a significant difference in the number of nascent blood vessels formed in the burn wounds after treatment with J-1 ADM compared with BDE. The highest numbers of newly formed and mature blood vessels were present in the J-1 ADM-treated excisional wounds after 21 days.

Excess molar volumes were calculated and correlated by the Legendre polynomials. The isobaric coefficients of thermal expansion and excess isobaric coefficients of thermal expansion of five binary solutions were estimated from temperature dependence of densities. Values of partial excess volumes at infinite dilution and excess refraction indices for these five binary systems at different temperature were calculated from the adjustable parameters of the Legendre polynomials. The molar refractions were calculated from the Lorentz-Lorenz equation. Factors affected these excess quantities were discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Here, we investigate the susceptible-infected epidemic process evolving on hierarchical networks in which agents randomly walk along the edges and establish contacts in network nodes. We employ a metapopulation modeling framework that allows us to explore the contagion spread patterns in relation to multi-scale mobility behaviors. A series of computer simulations revealed that a shifted power-law-like negative relationship between the peak timing of epidemics tau(0) and population density, and a logarithmic positive relationship between tau(0) and the network size, can both be explained by the gradual enlargement of fluctuations in the spreading process. We employ a semi-analytical method to better understand the nature of these relationships and the role of pertinent demographic factors. Additionally, we provide a quantitative discussion of the efficiency of a border screening procedure in delaying epidemic outbreaks on hierarchical networks, yielding a rather limited feasibility of this mitigation strategy but also its non-trivial dependence on population density, infector detectability, and the diversity of the susceptible region. Our results suggest that the interplay between the human spatial dynamics, network topology, and demographic factors can have important consequences for the global spreading and control of infectious diseases. These findings provide novel insights into the combined effects of human mobility and the organization of geographical networks on spreading processes, with important implications for both epidemiological research and health policy.

To unpin these anchored spirals, comparing to high-voltage side-effect traditional therapies, wave emission from heterogeneities (WEH) induced by the uniform electric field (UEF) has provided a low-voltage alternative. Here we provide a new approach using WEH induced by the circularly polarized electric field (CPEF), which has higher success rate and larger application scope than UEF, even with a lower voltage. And we also study the distribution of the membrane potential near an obstacle induced by CPEF to analyze its mechanism of unpinning. We hope this promising approach may provide a better alternative to terminate arrhythmia.

In this paper, other than traditional full interaction, we propose a partial interaction based spreading model, considering that the informed individuals would transmit information to only a certain fraction of their neighbors due to the transmission ability in real-world social networks. Simulation results on three representative networks (BA, ER, WS) indicate that the spreading efficiency is highly correlated with the network heterogeneity. In addition, a special phenomenon, namely Information Blind Areas where the network is separated by several information-unreachable clusters, will emerge from the spreading process. Furthermore, we also find that the size distribution of such information blind areas obeys power-law-like distribution, which has very similar exponent with that of site percolation. Detailed analyses show that the critical value is decreasing along with the network heterogeneity for the spreading process, which is complete the contrary to that of random selection. Moreover, the critical value in the latter process is also larger than that of the former for the same network. Those findings might shed some lights in in-depth understanding the effect of network properties on information spreading.

We examined the effects of changing the central bridging heteroatoms of the five-ring-fused thienoacene core identity from sulfur [DPP2(PTA)] to nitrogen [DPP2(NPTA)] in the small-molecule donor material. Replacement of the bridging atom with a different electronic structure has a visible effect on both the optical and electrical properties: DPP2(NPTA), which contains much more electron-rich pyrrole in the central thienoacene unit, possesses red-shifted absorption and a higher HOMO level relative to DPP2(PTA) with the less electron-rich thiophene in the same position. More importantly, substitution of the bridging atoms results in a change of the substituting alkyl chains due to the nature of the heteroatoms, which significantly tailored the crystallization behavior and the ability to form an interpenetrating network in thin-film blends with an electron acceptor. Compared to DPP2(PTA) with no alkyl chain substituting on the central sulfur atom of the PTA unit, DPP2(NPTA) exhibits improved crystallinity and better miscibility with PC71BM probably because of a dodecyl chain on the central nitrogen atom of the NPTA unit. These features endow the DPP2(NPTA)/PC71BM blend film higher hole mobility and better donor/acceptor interpenetrating network morphology. Optimized photovoltaic device fabrication based on DPP2(NPTA)/PC71BM (1.5:1, w/w) has resulted in an average power conversion efficiency (PCE) as high as 3.69% (the maximum PCE was 3.83%). This study demonstrates that subtle changes and tailoring of the molecular structure, such as simply changing the bridging heteroatom in the thienoacene unit in D/A-type small molecules, can strongly affect the physical properties that govern their photovoltaic performances.

Herein we exploit the orthogonality of coordination-driven self-assembly and crown-ether host-guest complexation to obtain a [4]molecular necklace and a [7]molecular necklace based on a well-developed recognition motif of 1,2-bis(pyridinium)ethane/dibenzo[24]crown-8. By adapting the bis(pyridinium) motif into the backbone of a donor building block, the resulting semirigid dipyridyl species can serve both as a structural element in the formation of metallacycles and as a site for subsequent host-guest chemistry. The pseudo-linear nature of the donor precursor lends itself to the formation of triangular and hexagonal central metallacycles based on the complementary acceptor unit used. This exemplary system organizes up to 18 molecules from three unique species in solution to afford a single supramolecular ensemble.

As natural killer cells (NK cells) are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte critical to the innate immune system, we investigated the mechanism of NK cells-induced brain injuries after cerebral ischemia and the chemotactic effect of IP-10 simultaneously. Methods: NK cells infiltration, interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and IP-10 expression were detected by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, PCR and flow cytometry in human and C57/BL6 wild type mouse ischemic brain tissues. The ischemia area was detected via 2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride staining. CXCR3 mean fluorescence intensity of isolated NK cells was measured by flow cytometry. The neuronal injury made by NK cells was examined via apoptosis experiment. The chemotactic of IP-10 was detected by migration and permeability assays. Results: In human ischemic brain tissue, infiltrations of NK cells were observed and reached a peak at 2 to 5 days. In a permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model, infiltration of NK cells into the ischemic infarct region reached their highest levels 12 hours after ischemia. IFN-gamma-positive NK cells and levels of the chemokine IP-10 were also detected within the ischemic region, from 6 hours up to 4 days after pMCAO was performed, and IFN-gamma. levels decreased after NK cells depletion in vivo. Co-culture experiments of neural cells with NK cells also showed that neural necrosis was induced via IFN-gamma. In parallel experiments with IP-10, the presence of CXCR3 indicates that NK cells were affected by IP-10 via CXCR3, and the effect was dose-dependent. After IP-10 depletion in vivo, NK cells decreased. In migration assays and permeability experiments, disintegration of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was observed following the addition of NK cells. Moreover, in the presence of IP-10 this injury was aggravated. Conclusions: All findings support the hypothesis that NK cells participate in cerebral ischemia and promote neural cells necrosis via IFN-gamma. Moreover, IP-10 intensifies injury to the BBB by NK cells via CXCR3.

However, it remains unclear whether the states of eyes-open (EO) relative to eyes-closed (EC) are associated with different topological organizations of functional neural networks for exteroceptive and interoceptive processing (processing the external world and internal state, respectively). Here, we used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and neural network analysis to investigate the topological properties of functional networks of the human brain when the eyes were open versus closed. The brain networks exhibited higher cliquishness and local efficiency, but lower global efficiency during the EO state compared to the EC state. These properties suggest an increase in specialized information processing along with a decrease in integrated information processing in EO (vs. EC). More importantly, the "exteroceptive" network, including the attentional system (e.g., superior parietal gyrus and inferior parietal lobule), ocular motor system (e.g., precentral gyrus and superior frontal gyrus), and arousal system (e.g., insula and thalamus), showed higher regional nodal properties (nodal degree, efficiency and betweenness centrality) in EO relative to EC. In contrast, the "interoceptive" network, composed of visual system (e.g., lingual gyrus, fusiform gyrus and cuneus), auditory system (e.g., Heschl's gyurs), somatosensory system (e.g., postcentral gyrus), and part of the default mode network (e.g., angular gyrus and anterior cingulate gyrus), showed significantly higher regional properties in EC vs. EO. In addition, the connections across sensory modalities were altered by volitional eye opening. The synchronicity between the visual system and the motor, somatosensory and auditory systems, characteristic of EC, was attenuated in EO. Further, the connections between the visual system and the attention, arousal and subcortical systems were increased in EO. These results may indicate that EO leads to a suppression of sensory modalities (other than visual) to allocate resources to exteroceptive processing. Our findings suggest that the topological organization of human brain networks dynamically switches corresponding to the information processing modes as we open or close our eyes.

The structure and morphology of the as-prepared samples were characterized by XRD, SEM, and EDS. Results indicated that plum-like Fe3O4 microspheres with the size of about 200-300 nm were uniformly self-assembled along the surface of the CNxNTs to form necklace-like structures. The magnetic saturation value was about 61 emu/g for the Fe3O4/CNxNTs architectures, which is enough strong to preserve its good performance of magnetic recovery. The novel magnetic hybrid materials are believed to have potential applications in sensors, separation technology, microwave absorption, nanotechnology, and biomedical areas. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Methods: Twenty-five drug-free OCD patients underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After 16-weeks, seventeen patients who received SSRI treatment were rescanned. Twenty-three matched healthy control subjects were examined at baseline for comparison, and 21 of them were rescanned after 16 weeks. Topological properties of brain networks (including small-world, efficiency, modularity, and connectivity degree) were analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally with graph-theory approach. Results: At baseline, OCD patients relative to healthy control subjects showed decreased small-world efficiency (including local clustering coefficient, local efficiency, and small-worldness) and functional association between default-mode and frontoparietal modules as well as widespread altered connectivity degrees in many brain areas. We observed clinical improvement in OCD patients after 16 weeks of SSRI treatment, which was accompanied by significantly elevated small-world efficiency, modular organization, and connectivity degree. Improvement of obsessive-compulsive symptoms was significantly correlated with changes in connectivity degree in right ventral frontal cortex in OCD patients after treatment. Conclusions: This is first study to use graph-theory approach for investigating valuable biomarkers for the effects of SSRI on neuronal circuitries of OCD patients. Our findings suggest that OCD phenomenology might be the outcome of disrupted optimal balance in the brain networks and that reinstating this balance after SSRI treatment accompanies significant symptom improvement.

Methods: Conditional alleles of Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 were generated (Pou4f1(loxP) and Pou4f2(loxP) respectively) for the removal of Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 in adult retinas. A tamoxifen-inducible Cre was used to delete Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 in adult mice and retinal sections and flat mounts were subjected to immunohistochemistry to confirm the deletion of both alleles and to quantify the changes in the number of RGCs and other retinal neurons. To determine the effect of loss of Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 on RGC survival after axonal injury, controlled optic nerve crush (CONC) was performed and RGC death was assessed. Results: Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 were ablated two weeks after tamoxifen treatment. Retinal interneurons and Muller glial cells are not affected by the ablation of Pou4f1 or Pou4f2 or both. Although the deletion of both Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 slightly delays the death of RGCs at 3 days post-CONC in adult mice, it does not affect the cell death progress afterwards. Moreoever, deletion of Pou4f1 or Pou4f2 or both has no impact on the long-term viability of RGCs at up to 6 months post-tamoxifen treatment. Conclusion: Pou4f1 and Pou4f2 are involved in the acute response to damage to RGCs but are dispensable for the long-term survival of adult RGC in mice.

However, their use in food industry is limited mostly because of their poor water-solubility and low thermal stability. Ferritins are widely distributed in nature with a shell-like structure which offers a great opportunity to improve the water-solubility and thermal stability of the carotenoids by encapsulation. In this work, recombinant human H-chain ferritin (rHuHF) was prepared and used to encapsulate beta-carotene, a typical compound among carotenoids, by taking advantage of the reversible dissociation and reassembly characteristic of apoferritin in different pH environments. Results from high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), UV/Vis spectroscopy and transmission electron microscope (TEM) indicated that beta-carotene molecules were successfully encapsulated within protein cages with a beta-carotene/protein molar ratio of 12.4-1. Upon such encapsulation, these beta-carotene-containing apoferritin nanocomposites were water-soluble. Interestingly, the thermal stability of the beta-carotene encapsulated within apoferritin nanocages was markedly improved as compared to free beta-carotene. These new properties might be favourable to the utilisation of beta-carotene in food industry. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through quantum measuring of flux qubit, entangled coherent states of two large Josephson junctions are obtained. The concurrence of entangled coherent states can be accommodated by adjusted systematic parameters. We also give a brief discussion on the experimental feasibility of this proposal.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of chi(cJ) decaying into eta ' K+K-	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using (106.41 +/- 0.86) x 10(6) Psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, we study for the first time the decay chi(cJ) -> eta'K+K- (J = 1, 2), where eta' -> gamma rho(0) and eta' -> eta pi(+)pi(-). A partial wave analysis in the covariant tensor amplitude formalism is performed for the decay chi(c1) -> eta'K+K-. Intermediate processes chi(c1) -> eta'f(2)'(1525) chi(c1) -> K-0*(1430)K-+/-(-/+) (K-0*(1430)(+/-) -> eta'K-+/-) are observed with statistical significances larger than 5 sigma, and their branching fractions are measured.

J	Tang, XY; Li, J; Liang, ZF; Wang, JY				Tang, Xiao-yan; Li, Jing; Liang, Zu-feng; Wang, Jian-yong			Variable separation solutions and interacting waves of a coupled system of the modified KdV and potential BLMP equations	PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Variable separation solution; Interacting wave; Periodic wave; Dromion; Instanton	LOCALIZED EXCITATIONS	The multilinear variable separation approach (MLVSA) is applied to a coupled modified Korteweg-de Vries and potential Boiti-Leon-Manna-Pempinelli equations, as a result, the potential fields u(y) and v(y) are exactly the universal quantity applicable to all multilinear variable separable systems. The generalized MLVSA is also applied, and it is found that u(y) (v(y)) is rightly the subtraction (addition) of two universal quantities with different parameters. Then interactions between periodic waves are discussed, for instance, the elastic interaction between two semi-periodic waves and non-elastic interaction between two periodic instantons. An attractive phenomenon is observed that a dromion moves along a semi-periodic wave. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, Q; Wang, GL; Xia, FB; Chen, DR				Xie, Qi; Wang, Guilin; Xia, Fubiao; Chen, Deren			Self-certified proxy convertible authenticated encryption: formal definitions and a provably secure scheme	CONCURRENCY AND COMPUTATION-PRACTICE & EXPERIENCE			English	Article						self-certified; authenticated encryption; proxy signature; convertible; provably secure	SIGNCRYPTION SCHEMES; PUBLIC KEYS; CRYPTANALYSIS; IMPROVEMENT; SIGNATURES	In 2009, Wu and Lin introduced the concept of self-certified proxy convertible authenticated encryption (SP-CAE) by integrating self-certified public-key system and designated verifier proxy signature with message recovery. They also presented the first SP-CAE scheme which is based the discrete logarithm problem. However, Wu-Lin scheme is not secure as Xie et al. recently showed that this scheme is existentially forgeable under adaptive chosen warrants, unconfidentiable and verifiable under adaptive chosen messages and designated verifiers. In this paper, we first discuss the security requirements of SP-CAE and then formally define unforgeability, message confidentiality, and unverifiability. Consequently, the first complete formal model of SP-CAE is proposed. After that, we propose a provably secure SP-CAE scheme by using two-party Schnorr signature introduced by Nicolosi et al. in 2003. Finally, we prove the formal security of the proposed scheme in the random oracle model under the discrete logarithm assumption. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for the rare decays J/y -> D-s(-) rho(+) and J/psi -> <(D)over bar(0)<(K)over bar*(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							WEAK DECAYS; PSI	A search for the rare decays of J/psi -> D-S(-) rho(+) + c.c. and J/psi -> <(D)over bar(0)<(K)over bar*(0) + c.c. is performed with a data sample of 225.3-million J/psi events collected with the Beijing Spectrometer III detector. No evident signal is observed. Upper limits on the branching fractions are determined to be beta(J/psi -> D-S(-)rho(+) + c.c.) < 1.3 x 10(-5) and beta(J/psi -> <(D)over bar(0)<(K)over bar*(0) + c.c.) < 2.5 x 10(-6) at the 90% confidence level.

However, a deeper understanding on the clonality-climate relationships along large geographic gradients is still scarce. In this study we revealed the clonality-climate relationships along latitudinal gradient of entire China spanning from tropics to temperate zones using clonality data for 4015 vascular plant species in 545 terrestrial communities. Structural equation modeling (SEM) showed that, in general, the preponderance of clonality increased along the latitudinal gradient towards cold, dry or very wet environments. However, the distribution of clonality in China was significantly but only weakly correlated with latitude and four climatic factors (mean annual temperature, temperature seasonality, mean annual precipitation, precipitation seasonality). Clonality of woody and herbaceous species had opposite responses to climatic variables. More precisely, woody clonality showed higher frequency in wet or climatically stable environments, while herbaceous clonality preferred cold, dry or climatically instable environments. Unexplained variation in clonality may be owed to the influences of other environmental conditions and to different clonal strategies and underlying traits adopted by different growth forms and phylogenetic lineages. Therefore, in-depth research in terms of more detailed clonal growth form, phylogeny and additional environmental variables are encouraged to further understand plant clonality response to climatic and/or edaphic conditions.

RHOMBOIDALES; EASTERN CHINA; ZHEJIANG; GUANGXI	Carex remotistachya, C. daxinensis and C. fangiana, three new species from China, are described and illustrated. Carex remotistachya resembles C. doniana (sect. Molliculae), differing by having spikes remote, staminate spikes with a 3-5 cm long peduncle at the base, leaves 3-6 mm wide, and stigmas shorter than perigynia. Carex daxinensis is similar to C. caudispicata (sect. Radicales), but differs in having perigynia ellipsoid-ovoid, 4-4.5 mm long, staminate parts of spikes shorter than pistillate ones, and leaves 2-3.5 mm wide. Carex fangiana is similar to C. nitidiutriculata (sect. Hymenochlaenae), differing by having leaves 6-9 mm wide, staminate spike solitary, and perigynia glabrous.

Different types of magnetic phases can be reached by tuning the magnetic dipolar interaction strength by modifying the trapping geometry. We investigate the atom-number fluctuations of the ground state and show that the different internal hyperfine states exhibit super-Poissonian, Poissonian, and sub-Poissonian distributions with different trapping geometries and strengths of the external magnetic field. We also propose a scheme to create a macroscopic maximally entangled spin state by slowly sweeping the external magnetic field.

J	Narisong; Jiang, JY; Liu, HT				Narisong; Jiang, Jingyang; Liu, Haitao			Word Length Distribution in Mongolian	JOURNAL OF QUANTITATIVE LINGUISTICS			English	Article								This paper addresses the distribution features of word length and stem length in Mongolian, employing both dynamic (a corpus of 1 million Mongolian word tokens) and static (an orthographic Mongolian dictionary and a Mongolian stem dictionary) language resources. The results show that the Mongolian words and stems abide by the Poisson distribution. Concretely, the word length from the dynamic corpus abide by the Dacey-Poisson distribution, and all the others abide by the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution. In addition, the Mongolian word lengths are influenced by word frequencies, basically abiding by Zipf's Principle of Least Effort. The fitting experiments of power functions relationship between Mongolian word lengths and word frequencies using individual short texts, continuous long texts, and fixed-length texts indicate that the individual texts with fixed length (about 2000 words) yield the best fitting results.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a Charged Charmoniumlike Structure in e(+)e(-) -> (D* (D)over-bar*)(+/-)pi(-/+) at root s=4.26 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							HIGH-ENERGY	We study the process e(+)e(-) -> (D* (D) over bar*)(+/-)pi(-/+) at a center-of-mass energy of 4.26 GeV using a 827 pb(-1) data sample obtained with the BESIII detector at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. Based on a partial reconstruction technique, the Born cross section is measured to be (137 +/- 9 +/- 15) pb. We observe a structure near the (D* (D) over bar*)(+/-) threshold in the pi(-/+) recoil mass spectrum, which we denote as the Z(c)(+/-) (4025). The measured mass and width of the structure are (4026.3 +/- 2.6 +/- 3.7) MeV/c(2) and (24.8 +/- 5.6 +/- 7.7) MeV, respectively. Its production ratio sigma(e(+)e(-) -> Z(c)(+/-)(4025)pi(-/+)-> (D* (D) over bar*)(+/-)pi(-/+)/sigma(e(+)e(-) -> (D* (D) over bar*)(+/-)pi(-/+) is determined to be 0.65 +/- 0.09 +/- 0.06. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second are systematic.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H. S.; Chen, J. C.; Chen, M.

Our major concern over privacy preserving in distributed data mining is the accuracy of the data mining results while privacy preserving is ensured. Corresponding to the horizontally partitioned data, this paper presents a new hybrid algorithm for privacy preserving distributed data mining. The main idea of the algorithm is to combine the method of random orthogonal matrix transformation with the proposed secure multi-party protocol of matrix product to achieve zero loss of accuracy in most data mining implementations.

J	Qian, ZM; Ou, R				Qian Zhaoming; Ou Rong			Ezra Pound's Collaboration with David Wang	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Thrones; earthly paradise; The Sacred Edict; collaboration		Pound's Cantos 98-99 as part of the Thrones section of The Cantos have never been approached from the perspective of cultural studies. Based on published and unpublished materials, this paper traces Cantos 98-99's reinterpretation of Kangxi's Sacred Edict to little known interactions between Pound and David Rafael Wang. In February 1957 Pound asked Wang to translate Yongzheng's expanded version of the Edict into English. A wealth of the Edict material and other Chinese notions Pound and Wang discussed went into Cantos 98-99. The paper is intended not only to bring to light the specific contribution Wang made to Cantos 98-99 but also to open up some of Pound's finest late lyrics.

However, whether A20 may affect inflammation during peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is still unclear. This study was aimed to investigate the effect of A20 overexpression on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory response in rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (RPMCs). Isolated and cultured RPMCs in vitro. Plasmid pGEM-T easy-A20 was transfected into RPMCs by Lipofectamine (TM) 2000. The protein expression of A20, phospho-I kappa B alpha, I kappa B alpha, TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) 6 and CD40 were analyzed by Western blot. The mRNA expression of TRAF6, CD40, interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-alpha) were determined by real time-PCR. NF-kappa B p65 DNA binding activity, IL-6 and TNF-alpha levels in cells culture supernatant were determined by ELISA. Our results revealed that RPMCs overexpression of A20 lead to significant decrease of LPS-induced I kappa B alpha phosphorylation and NF-kappa B DNA binding activity (all p < 0.01). In addition, A20 also attenuated the expression of TRAF6, CD40, IL-6 and TNF-alpha as well as levels of IL-6 and TNF-alpha in cells culture supernatant (all p < 0.05). However, A20 only partly inhibited CD40 expression. Our study indicated that A20 overexpression may depress the inflammatory response induced by LPS in cultured RPMCs through negatively regulated the relevant function of adaptors in LPS signaling pathway.

The different variables: affecting the adsorption capacity Such as pH of the solution; temperature and contact-time have been investigated, which indicate that D113-III resit could adsorb Co(l) effectively from aqueous solution. The results show that the optimal adsorption condition of D113-III resin for CO(II) is achieved at pH = 6.5. The maximum saturated adsorption Capacity of CO(II) is 192.1 mg.g(-1) D113-III resin rat 298 K. The thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G degrees which were all negative and Delta H degrees Which was positive, indicated that the adsorption of Co(II) ion onto D113-III resin was spontaneous and endothermic, respectively. Positive Delta S degrees value of Co(II) adsorption process indicates an irregular increase of the randomness at the D113-III resin-solution interface during adsorption. Adsorption isotherms correlated well with the Langmuir model. Experimental data were also evaluated to find out kinetic characteristics Of the adsorption process. Desorption: studies revealed that Co(II) ion could be eluted effectively by using the 0.25-1.0 mol L-1 HCl solution. Thomas Model was applied to experimental data to predict the breakthrough curves and to determine the characteristics parameters of the column Useful for process design.

In this work, the interactional reactivity between a remote silicon-based bulky group and an O-/N-containing functional group has been revealed and determined by lateral lithiation-substitution, desilylation, as well as desilylation-olefination with benzaldehyde. The results suggest considerable information transmission and steric hindrance that can be exploited for the controllable synthesis of atropisomeric molecules. Based on the remote steric effect of a functional group across the aromatic ring of an amide, the construction of isolable atropisomeric amides with functional groups, such as alcohol, amine, and olefin was successfully achieved. All these new atropisomers were obtained in reasonable yield in pure diastereomeric form, and the specific configuration of representative products was confirmed by X-ray crystallography.

Whether the lncRNAs could form structured precursors for small RNAs (sRNAs) production remains elusive. Here, 172 713 DCL1 (Dicer-like 1)-dependent sRNAs were identified in Arabidopsis. Except for the sRNAs mapped onto the microRNA precursors, the remaining ones led us to investigate their originations. Intriguingly, 65 006 sRNAs found their loci on 5891 lncRNAs. These sRNAs were sent to AGO (Argonaute) enrichment analysis. As a result, 1264 sRNAs were enriched in AGO1, which were then subjected to target prediction. Based on degradome sequencing data, 109 transcripts were validated to be targeted by 96 sRNAs. Besides, 44 lncRNAs were targeted by 23 sRNAs. To further support the origination of the DCL1-dependent sRNAs from lncRNAs, we searched for the degradome-based cleavage signals at either ends of the sRNA loci, which were supposed to be produced during DCL1-mediated processing of the long-stem structures. As a result, 63 612 loci were supported by degradome signatures. Among these loci, 6606 reside within the dsRNA-seq (double-stranded RNA sequencing) read-covered regions of 100 nt or longer. These regions were subjected to secondary structure prediction. And, 43 regions were identified to be capable of forming highly complementary long-stem structures. We proposed that these local long-stem structures could be recognized by DCL1 for cropping, thus serving as the sRNA precursors. We hope that our study could inspire more research efforts to study on the biological roles of the lncRNAs in plants.

Oxidative stress is considered the major cytotoxic mechanism of microcystin-LR (MCLR). Quercetin (QE) is a flavonoid that can eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and elicit anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effects. This study determined the regulatory effect of QE on the cytotoxicity and oxidative stress of Carassius auratus lymphocytes induced by 1 mu g/L MCLR in vitro after 24 h. MCLR-mediated cytotoxicity and ROS formation in fish lymphocytes were suppressed by QE in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, QE enhanced the endogenous antioxidant defense system and the Bax/Bc1-2 ratio to protect fish lymphocytes against oxidative stress and apoptosis induced by MCLR. Glutathione levels and catalase activities increased by approximately 3.9- and 2-fold, respectively, in the QE treatment group (1000 mu g/L) compared with the MCLR treatment group. The percentage of apoptosis in the only MCLR treatment group was 59% whereas that in the control group was 23%. The percentage of apoptosis in the high-dose QE treatment group (1000 mu g/L) was 29%, lower by nearly half compared with the only MCLR treatment group. QE (1000 mu g/L) effectively inhibited the expression of caspase-3 protein by nearly 43% compared with the only MCLR treatment group. The results obtained clearly indicate that QE can effectively prevent MCLR-induced immunotoxicity by eliminating oxidative stress and blocking the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in fish lymphocytes.

Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect in newborns. Plasma proteins may serve as indicators of disease and are a rich source for biomarker discovery, but little has been studied in CHD. We examined the hypothesis that plasma proteins may be altered and related to the pathologic changes of CHD. Methods. Differential protein analysis was performed in the plasma of patients with tetralogy of Fallot, isolated ventricular septal defect, and normal controls by using two-dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry. Candidate proteins that might be related to disease processes were further confirmed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in the new samples (n = 40). Results. Identified were 18 differentially expressed protein spots and 10 corresponding proteins or polypeptides. Among those, 2 downregulated proteins, gelsolin, ficolin-3, with significant clinical relevance, were further analyzed for validation. The plasma levels of gelsolin (76.30 +/- 4.42 vs 131.80 +/- 23.46 mg/mL in control; p = 0.025, n = 40 in each group) and ficolin-3 (4.93 +/- 0.36 vs 10.58 +/- 1.58 mg/mL in control; p = 0.001, n = 40 in each group) in tetralogy patients were significantly lower than those in normal controls. The ficolin-3 plasma level was also lower in the patients with isolated VSD (5.55 +/- 0.34 vs 10.58 +/- 1.58 mg/mL in control mg/mL; p = 0.003, n = 40 in each group). Conclusions. We used proteomic methods to demonstrate for the first time the plasma protein changes in CHD patients that may reveal the possible mechanisms for the prolonged bleeding time in tetralogy patients and the susceptibility to pulmonary infections in patients with CHDs. These findings have strong clinical implications.

A retrospective, matched case-control study was conducted consisting of 12 patients with cirrhosis diagnosed with TBP between 2008 and 2011. Control subjects were patients with SBP. Clinical features and laboratory data were analyzed. Compared with SBP, TBP in patients with cirrhosis was frequently associated with extraperitoneal tuberculosis (25 vs. 0%), a more insidious onset (39.67 +/- 30.00 vs. 21.60 +/- 21.50 days; P<0.05), Child-Pugh classification B at onset (67 vs. 32%; P<0.05) and lymphopenia (0.67 +/- 0.22 vs. 1.19 +/- 0.41x10(9)/l; P<0.01). Patients with TBP tended to have lymphocytic predominance in the peritoneal fluid (92%), while patients with SBP tended to have neutrophil predominance (68%). Compared with the SBP group, the TBP group had significantly higher ascitic protein, adenosine deaminase (ADA) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels. Ascitic protein levels were >25 g/l in 9 patients (75%) in the TBP group and in 2 patients (8%) in the SBP group; ascitic ADA activity levels were >27 U/l in 8 patients (67%) in the TBP group, but were not >27 U/l in any of the patients in the SBP group; ascitic LDH levels were >90 U/l in 10 patients (83%) in the TBP group and 5 patients (20%) in the SBP group. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that TBP should be considered in cirrhotic patients with relevant clinical manifestations and characteristics of laboratory observations.

We investigated the role of icariin in anti-inflammation and anti-anxiety potential in a murine model combined psychosocial stress with allergic exposure. The results indicated that icariin administered remarkable increased activity in the center of the open field, reversed airway hyperresponsivenesss, reduced inflammatory cytokine infiltration to the lung and whole body and also in part recovered glucocorticoid responsiveness. Furthermore, our data also showed that icariin significantly inhibited increases of corticosterone and markedly increased glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein expression in the lungs of mice exposed to both stress and allergen. Collectively, we speculate that inducing glucocorticoid receptor modulation might be the potential mechanisms of icariin to facilitate corticosteroid responsiveness of cytokine production.

In order to explore universality of scale-free systems, we propose an extended network model based on Barabasi-Albert model by developing and decaying networks. The novel network evolves by growing and optimizing processes, such as the addition of new nodes and edges, or deletion of edges at every time step. Meanwhile, in order to describe more realistic phenomena of reality, we introduce the fitness to reflect the competition and local event of inner anti-preferential mechanism to delete the edges. We calculate analytically the degree distribution and find that the Barabasi-Albert model is only one of its special cases and the model self-organizes into scale-free networks, moreover, the numerical simulations are in good agreement with the analytical conclusions. The results imply that this extended model has more comprehensive and universal simulation and reflection in complex network topology characters and evolution with practices and applications.

Based on a model of light interaction with human skin, we define the change of blood concentration due to arterial pulsation as a pixel quotient in log space, and successfully use the derived signal for computing the pulse heart rate. Various experiments with different cameras, different illumination condition, and different skin locations were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Examples computed with normal illumination show the algorithm is comparable with pulse oximeter devices both in accuracy and sensitivity.

Here, we report mouse genetic evidence that IL-17A is critical for tumor growth. IL-17A-deficient mice exhibited reduced tumor growth, whereas systemic administration of recombinant mouse IL-17A promoted the growth of hepatocellular carcinoma. The tumor-promoting effect of IL-17A was mediated through suppression of antitumor responses, especially CD8(+) T-cell responses. Furthermore, we found that IL-17A was produced mainly byV gamma 4 gamma delta T cells, insofar as depleting V gamma delta gd T cells reduced tumor growth, whereas adoptive transfer of V gamma delta gd T cells promoted tumor growth. Mechanistic investigations showed that IL-17A induced CXCL5 production by tumor cells to enhance the infiltration of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) to tumor sites in a CXCL5/CXCR2-dependent manner. IL-17A also promoted the suppressive activity of MDSC to reinforce suppression of tumoral immunity. Moreover, we found that MDSC could induce IL-17A-producing gd T cells via production of IL-1 beta and IL-23. Conversely, IL-17A could also enhance production of IL-1 beta and IL-23 in MDSC as a positive feedback. Together, our results revealed a novel mechanism involving cross-talk among gd T cells, MDSCs, and tumor cells through IL-17A production. These findings offer new insights into how IL-17A influences tumor immunity, with potential implications for the development of tumor immunotherapy. (C)2014 AACR.

To create aggregate-state emissive BODIPY luminogens, tetraphenylethene (TPE), which is a popular luminogen with intriguing aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristic, is introduced as periphery to a methylated BODIPY core. Three TPE-BODIPY adducts are synthesized and characterized, and their photophysical properties and electronic structures are investigated. The incorporation of AIE-active TPE units alleviates aggregation-caused quenching of BODIPY core, furnishing emissive nanoparticles based on TPE-BODIPY adducts. Significantly, the two-photon absorption (TPA) and two-photon excited fluorescence (TPEF) properties are improved as more TPE units are attached. The luminogens with 3TPE units (3TPE-BODIPY) shows the strongest TPA and TPEF in the wavelength range of 750-830 nm, with cross-section values of 264 and 116 GM at 810 nm, respectively. Red emissive nanoparticles with a Stokes shift of 60 nm and a fluorescence quantum yield of 16% are attained by encapsulating 3TPE-BODIPY with 1,2-sistearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(polyethylene glycol)-2000]. The nanoparticles are biocompatible and function well in TPEF cellular imaging and mouse brain blood vascular visualization.

Regulation of plant immunity through ubiquitin-mediated modulation of Ca2+-calmodulin-AtSR1/CAMTA3 signaling	PLANT JOURNAL			English	Article						plant defense; salicylic acid; ubiquitin; Arabidopsis thaliana; calcium/calmodulin; Pseudomonas syringae	BINDING TRANSCRIPTION ACTIVATORS; DISEASE-RESISTANCE; SALICYLIC-ACID; ARABIDOPSIS EDS1; DOMAIN PROTEINS; GENE; CALCIUM; FAMILY; DEFENSE; RECOGNITION	Transient changes in intracellular Ca2+ concentration are essential signals for activation of plant immunity. It has also been reported that Ca2+ signals suppress salicylic acid-mediated plant defense through AtSR1/CAMTA3, a member of the Ca2+/calmodulin-regulated transcription factor family that is conserved in multicellular eukaryotes. How plants overcome this negative regulation to mount an effective defense response during a stage of intracellular Ca2+ surge is unclear. Here we report the identification and functional characterization of an important component of ubiquitin ligase, and the associated AtSR1 turnover. The AtSR1 interaction protein1 (SR1IP1) was identified by CytoTrap two-hybrid screening. The loss-of-function mutant of SR1IP1 is more susceptible to bacterial pathogens, and over-expression of SR1IP1 confers enhanced resistance, indicating that SR1IP1 acts as a positive regulator of plant defense. SR1IP1 and AtSR1 act in the same signaling pathway to regulate plant immunity. SR1IP1 contains the structural features of a substrate adaptor in cullin3-based E3 ubiquitin ligase, and was shown to serve as a substrate adaptor that recruits AtSR1 for ubiquitination and degradation when plants are challenged with pathogens. Hence, SR1IP1 positively regulates plant immunity by removing the defense suppressor AtSR1. These findings provide a mechanistic insight into how Ca2+-mediated actions are coordinated to achieve effective plant immunity.	[Zhang, Lei; Poovaiah, B.

To survive this metalloid in the environment, nearly all organisms develop strategies to tolerate arsenic toxicity to some degree. Some arsenic-resistance genes have been identified in bacteria and yeast, but for mammals, especially humans, these genes are largely unknown. The aim of the present study was to identify these genes and benefit our intervention of arsenic resistance. We first established a human arsenic-resistant ECV-304 (AsRE) cell line and then used suppression subtractive hybridization and microarray analysis to identify arsenic-resistant genes in these cells. Of the significantly upregulated genes, three ATP-binding cassette (ABC) subfamily members, namely ABCA1, ABCE1 and ABCF1, were chosen for further study with RNA interference and overexpression analyses. The 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2 thiazoyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay was used to determine the cell survival rate and the IC50, whereas atomic fluorescence spectrophotometry was used to determine intracellular arsenic levels. We found that among the three ABC genes, only when ABCA1 gene expression was silenced did cells obviously lose their arsenic tolerance. The arsenic accumulation in ABCA1 deficiency AsRE cells was greater than that in wild type AsRE cells. Overexpression of ABCA1 in HeLa cells decreased arsenic accumulation in the cells and the cells were more resistant to As(III) than control cells transfected with empty vector. These results suggest a new functional role for ABCA1 in the development of arsenic resistance in human cells.

The protein (Gox2036) was purified to homogeneity and biochemically characterized. Gox2036 was a homotetramer with a subunit size of approximately 28 kDa. Gox2036 had a strict requirement for NAD(+)/NADH as the cofactor. Gox2036 displayed preference for oxidation of secondary alcohols and 2,3-diols as well as for reduction of alpha-diketones, hydroxy ketones, alpha-ketoesters, and beta-ketoesters. However, Gox2036 was poorly active on 1,2-diols and acetoin and showed no activity on primary alcohols, polyols, and aldehydes. The optimum pH values for the oxidation and reduction reactions were 9 and 6, respectively. Gox2036 was highly selective in the reduction of various beta-ketones and beta-ketoesters. Among the substrates tested, ethyl 4-chloro acetoacetate was reduced to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ester with an excellent conversion yield of 96.9 % and optical purity of > 99 % e.e. using an efficient in situ NADH-recycling system involving glucose and a glucose dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis (BsGDH).

In this study, sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers were applied to molecular phylogeny analysis and species identification of 31 Chinese Dendrobium species. Fourteen SRAP primer pairs produced 727 loci, 97% of which (706) showed polymorphism. Average polymorphism information content of the SRAP pairs was 0.987 (0.982-0.991), showing that plenty of genetic diversity exists at the inter-species level of Chinese Dendrobium. The molecular phylogeny analysis (UPGMA) grouped the 31 Dendrobium species into six clusters. We obtained 18 species-specific markers, which can be used to identify 10 of the 31 species. Our results indicate the SRAP marker system is informative and would facilitate further application in germplasm appraisal, evolution, and genetic diversity studies in the genus Dendrobium.

The correlations between surface modification, morphology, dispersion/exfoliation and interfacial interaction of sheets and the corresponding mechanical and thermal properties of the composites were systematically investigated. The surface functionalization of DGEBA layer was found to effectively improve the compatibility and dispersion of GO sheets in epoxy matrix. The tensile test indicated that the DGEBA-f-GO/epoxy composites showed higher tensile modulus and strength than either the neat epoxy or the GO/epoxy composites. For epoxy composite with 0.25 wt% DGEBA-f-GO, the tensile modulus and strength increased from 3.15 +/- 0.11 to 3.56 +/- 0.08 GPa (similar to 13%) and 52.98 +/- 5.82 to 92.94 +/- 5.03 MPa (similar to 75%), respectively, compared to the neat epoxy resin. Furthermore, enhanced quasi-static fracture toughness (KO was measured in case of the surface functionalization. The GO and DGEBA-f-GO at 0.25 wt% loading produced similar to 26% and similar to 41% improvements in K-IC values of epoxy composites, respectively. Fracture surface analysis revealed improved interfacial interaction between DGEBA-f-GO and matrix. Moreover, increased glass transition temperature and thermal stability of the DGEBA-f-GO/epoxy composites were also observed in the dynamic mechanical properties and thermo-gravimetric analysis compared to those of the GO/epoxy composites.

Most of previous works in this area mainly focus on discussing the effects of spreading probability or immunization strategy on static networks. However, in real systems, the peer-to-peer network structure changes constantly according to frequently social activities of users. In order to capture this dynamical property and study its impact on information spreading, in this paper, a link rewiring strategy based on the Fermi function is introduced. In the present model, the informed individuals tend to break old links and reconnect to their second-order friends with more uninformed neighbors. Simulation results on the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model with fixed recovery time T 1 indicate that the information would spread more faster and broader with the proposed rewiring strategy. Extensive analyses of the information cascade size distribution show that the spreading process of the initial steps plays a very important role, that is to say, the information will spread out if it is still survival at the beginning time. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of information spreading on dynamical social networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Consequently, agricultural energy and agrochemical inputs have been significantly increased to improve food security and to increase the income of farmers in the regions where the GFGP was implemented. In analysis of the sustainability of the agricultural system affected by the GFGP, it is essential to consider both economic profitability and environmental sustainability. Using Yanchi County as a case study area, this study used an emergy synthesis to examine the sustainability of the agricultural system before and after the GFGP in Northwest China. We found that the total emergy input and energy output of the agricultural system in the study area increased from 1991 to 2008; however, the sustainability of the system declined, and this decline was especially evident after the GFGP was launched in 2001. Increasing inputs of non-renewable purchased resources will not only reduce the effectiveness of the GFGP in Northwest China, but also hinder the implementation of the energy-saving and emission-reduction policy that China launched in 2005. We suggest that sustainable agricultural development in Northwest China should be based on effective use of renewable resources and development of a low-carbon agricultural economy.

Nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI) and bimetallic systems have been shown to promote successfully the destruction of halogenated organic compounds. In the present study, nZVI and Pd/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles synthesized by chemical deposition were used to remove 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl from deionized water, and then applied to PCBs contaminated soil collected from an e-waste recycling area. The results indicated that the hydrodechlorination of 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorobiphenyl by nZVI and Pd/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles followed pseudo-first-order kinetics and Pd loading was beneficial to the hydrodechlorination process. It was also found that the removal efficiencies of PCBs from soil achieved using Pd/Fe bimetallic nanoparticles were higher than that achieved using nZVI and that PCBs degradation might be affected by the soil properties. Finally, the potential challenges of nZVI application to in situ remediation were explored.

The analytical expressions for the average intensity of a radial phase-locked partially coherent AHB array in turbulent atmosphere are derived based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle. By using the analytical expressions, the average intensity distribution and spreading properties of a radial phase-locked partially coherent AHB array in turbulent atmosphere and in free space are numerically studied. The results show that the propagation properties of a radial phase-locked partially coherent AHB array in turbulent atmosphere are significantly affected by initial beam parameters and the structure constant of turbulent atmosphere.

In this model, the weight of a link denotes the contact strength between two individuals connected by this link, and each susceptible individual may adaptively transfer the weight from a link to another. We find that this weight adaption process could significantly aggravate the prevalence of an epidemic. Moreover, we examine the effectiveness of the link-removal strategy with our model, and the results show that the weight adaption process may weaken the efficiency of the strategy. The theoretical analysis is supported by the simulation results. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, we discuss about mining webs with information extracted from search and browser logs of users. In particular, we utilize the keywords correlated with corresponding websites by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) technique to model users features and propose the tag-aware k-nearest neighbor Collaborative Filtering (CF). We then build a hybrid recommendation method to help people accurately find websites by employing Heat Spreading (HeatS) method. Experimental results demonstrate that the hybrid method outperforms baseline algorithms at the global ranking metric. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This study has found that PLB has a potent pro-apoptotic and pro-autophagic effect on A549 and H23 cells. PLB arrests cells in G2/M phase, and increases the intracellular level of reactive oxygen species in both cell lines. PLB dose-dependently induces autophagy through inhibition of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway as indicated by reduced phosphorylation of Akt and mTOR. Inhibition or induction of autophagy enhances PLB-induced apoptosis. There is crosstalk between PLB-induced apoptosis and autophagy. These findings indicate that PLB initiates both apoptosis and autophagy in NSCLC cells through coordinated pathways. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurements of B(D+ -> mu(+)nu(mu)), the pseudoscalar decay constant fD+, and the quark mixing matrix element vertical bar V-cd vertical bar	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MESONS	We report a measurement of the branching fraction B(D+ -> mu(+)nu(mu)) = [3.71 +/- 0.19(stat) +/- 0.06(sys)] x 10(-4) based on 2.92 fb(-1) of data accumulated at root s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. This measurement, in conjunction with the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element vertical bar V-cd vertical bar determined from a global Standard Model fit, implies a value for the weak decay constant f(D+) = (203.2 +/- 5.3 +/- 1.8) MeV. Additionally, using this branching fraction measurement together with a lattice QCD prediction for f(D+), we find vertical bar V-cd vertical bar 0.2210 +/- 0.0058 +/- 0.0047. In either case, these are the most precise results for these quantities to date.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, J. C.; Chen, M.

J	Li, G; Wang, HQ; Wang, LH; Chen, RP; Liu, JP				Li, Guo; Wang, Hui-qian; Wang, Li-hui; Chen, Ru-ping; Liu, Jun-ping			Distinct Pathways of ERK1/2 Activation by Hydroxy-Carboxylic Acid Receptor-1	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS; SIGNAL-REGULATED KINASES; FACTOR-I RECEPTOR; MEDIATED ACTIVATION; GROWTH; GAMMA; SRC; G(I); TRANSACTIVATION; MECHANISMS	Mechanistic investigations have shown that, upon agonist activation, hydroxy-carboxylic acid receptor-1(HCA(1)) couples to a G(i) protein and inhibits adenylate cyclase activity, leading to inhibition of liberation of free fatty acid. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms for HCA(1) signaling remain largely unknown. Using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HCA(1), and L6 cells, which endogenously express rat HCA(1) receptors, we found that activation of ERK1/2 by HCA(1) was rapid, peaking at 5 min, and was significantly blocked by pertussis toxin. Furthermore, time course experiments with different kinase inhibitors demonstrated that HCA(1) induced ERK1/2 activation via the extracellular Ca2+, PKC and IGF-I receptor transactivation-dependent pathways. In addition, we observed that pretreated the cells with M119K, an inhibitor of G(beta gamma) subunit-dependent signaling, effectively attenuated the ERK1/2 activation triggered by HCA(1), suggesting a critical role for bc-subunits in HCA(1)-activated ERK1/2 phosphorylation. Furthermore, the present results also indicated that the arrestin2/3 were not required for ERK1/2 activation. In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that upon binding to agonist, HCA(1) receptors initially activate G(i), leading to dissociation of the G(beta gamma) subunit from activated G(i), and subsequently induce ERK1/2 activation via two distinct pathways: one PKC-dependent pathway and the other IGF-IR transactivation-dependent pathway. Our results provide the first in-depth evidence that defines the molecular mechanism of HCA(1)-mediated ERK1/2 activation.

The effects of the RTIL on the morphology, crystal structure, and physical properties of the PVDF nanofibers were investigated. Incorporation of RTIL leads to an increase in the mean fiber diameter and the rough fiber surface of the PVDF/RTIL composite nanofibers compared with the neat PVDF nanofibers. The PVDF in the PVDF/RTIL nanofibers exhibits an extremely high content (almost 100%) of beta crystals, in contrast to the dominance of PVDF gamma crystals in bulk melt-blended PVDF/RTIL blends. Nonwoven fabrics produced from the electrospun PVDF/RTIL composite nanofibers show better stretchability and higher electrical conductivity than those made from neat PVDF without RTIL, and are thus excellent antielectrostatic fibrous materials. In addition, RTIL greatly improved the hydrophobicity of the PVDF fibers, enabling them to effectively separate a mixture of tetrachloromethane (CCl4) and water. The extremely high beta content, excellent antielectrostatic properties, better stretchability, and hydrophobicity of the present PVDF/RTIL nanofibers make them a promising candidate for micro- and nanoscale electronic device applications.

However, the universality of the doping dependence of this phase and its relation to other symmetry-breaking orders (such as superconductivity) in distinct families of iron pnictides remain outstanding questions. Here we use torque magnetometry as a probe to study the rotational symmetry breaking in EuFe2(As1-xPx)(2) without introducing external pressure. The nematic phase is found to proliferate well above the structural transition and to persist into the superconducting regime at optimal doping, after which it becomes absent or very weak, in sharp contrast to the behavior observed in BaFe2(As1-xPx)(2). These measurements suggest a putative quantum nematic transition near optimal doping under the superconducting dome.	[Xu, Xiaofeng; Zhou, N.; Li, Y.

In the electron-doped case, a d(x2-y2)(*)-wave superconducting phase is found in a narrow doping region. The pairing is driven by spin fluctuations within the single conduction band. In contrast, for hole doping an s(+/-)(*)-wave phase is established, triggered by spin fluctuations within and across the two conduction bands. In all cases there are comparable singlet and triplet components in the pairing function. The Hund's rule coupling reduces (enhances) superconductivity for electron (hole) doping. Our results imply that hole doping is more promising to achieve a higher transition temperature. Experimental perspectives are discussed.

A room temperature ionic liquid (IL), tributyl(methyl)ammonium bis(trifluoromethane)sulfonylimide ([tbmam(+)] [Tf2N-]), was integrated into polycarbonate (PC), to fabricate optically transparent antielectrostatic composites by melt processing. The morphology and physical properties of the composites were investigated. Differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis indicated the depression of the glass transition temperatures of the PC/IL composites, compared with that of neat PC. This indicated the interaction between PC and the IL. Transmission electron microscopy indicated that the IL was highly compatible with PC, at low IL loadings. This resulted in enhanced antielectrostatic properties, and significantly improved elongation at break of the PC/IL composites. The PC/IL composites maintained the high transmittance of PC. In addition, the PC/IL composites with high clearance and antielectrostatic properties could be achieved by large-scale continuous melt extrusion, indicating that the method to fabricate both optically transparent and antielectrostatic composite is feasible for industrial application.

The morphologies, storage modulus, glass transition temperatures, and physical properties have been investigated systematically. The decreased sizes and increased numbers of the epoxy domains in the epoxy/ACM blends were observed with the incorporation of MMT. The crosslinked epoxy/ACM binary blends show partially miscible phase structure, while the epoxy/ACM/MMT nanocomposites exhibit a more complete phase-separated behavior and an increased T-g of epoxy phase. It was found that the catalytic effect of MMT on the crosslinking reaction of epoxy resin accounts for the more complete separation of the two phases. A novel crosslinking induced clay exfoliation has been observed for the ternary nanocomposites. More surprisingly, a synergistic effect of MMT on both toughness and tensile modulus of epoxy/ACM blend were observed, probably originated from the fine domain sizes and appropriate interface-dispersed MMT platelets in the ternary nanocomposites. The fabricated materials have been used as the adhesive films for polyimide films and copper foils. The adhesive strength of the binary epoxy/ACM blends was found to be dependent on the thickness of the adhesive films. Moreover, a preferable increment in the adhesive property of epoxy/ACM/3 wt% MMT adhesive film was observed, resulting from the synergistic effect of the fine degree of crosslinking and tearing fracture of the adhesive film.

As different from previous studies, we find significant short-term memory in it. Moreover, the memory coefficient first decays in a power law and then turns to an exponential form. Our findings produce evidence for the strong short-term memory in human dynamics and challenge previous models. Accordingly, we propose a simple model based on temporal preference, which can well reproduce both the heavy-tailed nature and the strong memory effects. This work helps in understanding the temporal regularities of online human behaviors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different concentrations of SWNTs were incorporated into the apatite coating by adding functionalized SWNTs into the electrolyte. Homogeneous and crack-free SWNTs/HA composite coatings were achieved and the coatings had higher crystallinity compared to pure HA coating. In addition, the highest bonding strength of the SWNTs/HA coating reached 25.7 MPa, which was nearly 70% higher than that of pure HA coating. The in-vitro cellular biocompatibility tests revealed that SWNTs/HA composite coatings exhibited higher in-vitro bioactivity than that of pure HA coating and pure titanium (Ti). It suggests that SWNTs/HA composite coating may have enormous potential applications in the field of biomaterials, especially for the metal implants. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Fillers are arranged periodically in the system with period d and Lennard-Jones interaction between polymer and fillers is considered. Results show that the statistical dimension and dynamical diffusion of the polymer are dependent on the polymerfiller interaction strength epsilon(pf) and the relative size between R-G0 and d, here R-G0 is the radius of gyration of polymer in dilute solution. Normal diffusion of polymer is always observed in the regime 2R(G0) > d. And the diffusion coefficient D is scaled with chain length N as D similar to N a, where the exponent a increases with epf. Whereas in the regime 2R(G0) < d << Nl(0) with l(0) the mean bond length of polymer, normal diffusion is observed only at epsilon(pf) < 2, but the polymer will be adsorbed on the fillers and cannot diffuse at epsilon(pf) > 2. In addition, we find that there is a critical interaction strength epsilon* (pf) = 2 in our model system. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Efficient numerical methods are needed to solve LEPs for the analysis, design and optimization of microcavity lasers. Existing computational methods for two-dimensional LEPs include the multipole method and the boundary integral equation method. In particular, the multipole method has been applied to LEPs of periodic structures, but it requires sophisticated mathematical techniques for evaluating slowly converging infinite sums that appear due to the periodicity. In this paper, a new method is developed for periodic LEPs based on the so-called Dirichlet-to-Neumann maps. The method is efficient since it avoids the slowly converging sums and can easily handle periodic structures with many arrays.

In this study, 25 upregulated proteins were identified using 2D electrophoresis (2-DE) coupled with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). These proteins were involved in (i) PCB degradation (i.e., 3-chlorobenzoate-3,4-dioxygenase); (ii) transport processes [e. g., ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter substrate-binding protein, amino acid ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, peptide ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, putrescine-binding protein, periplasmic solute-binding protein, branched-chain amino acid uptake periplasmic solutebinding protein, periplasmic phosphate-binding protein, phosphonate ABC transporter substrate-binding protein, and xylose ABC transporter substrate-binding protein]; (iii) energetic metabolism (e. g., methanol/ethanol family pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent dehydrogenase, malate-CoA ligase subunit beta, enolase, ATP synthase beta subunit, FOF1 ATP synthase subunit beta, ATP synthase a subunit, and IMP cyclohydrolase); (iv) electron transport (cytochrome b(6)f complex FeS protein); (v) general stress response (e. g., molecular chaperone DnaK, elongation factor G, and translation elongation factor thermostable); (vi) carbon metabolism (methanol dehydrogenase and malate-CoA ligase subunit beta); and (vii) nitrogen reductase (nitrous oxide reductase). The results of real-time polymerase chain reaction showed that the genes encoding for dioxygenase, ABC transporters, transmembrane proteins, electron transporter, and energetic metabolism proteins were significantly upregulated during PCB degradation. These genes upregulated by 1.26- to 8.98-fold. These findings reveal the resistance and adaptation of cyanobacterium to the presence of PCBs, shedding light on the complexity of PCB catabolism by Anabaena PD-1.

BESIII Collaboration	Amplitude analysis of the D+ -> K-S(0)pi + (0)(pi) Dalitz plot	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							DECAYS	We perform an analysis of the D+ -> K-S(0)pi + (0)(pi) Dalitz plot using a data set of 2.92 fb(-1) of e(+) e(-) collisions at the (3770) mass accumulated by the BESIII experiment, in which 166694 candidate events are selected with a background of 15.1%. The Dalitz plot is found to be well represented by a combination of six quasitwo- body decay channels [k(SP)(0)(+) (1450)(+,) ] plus a small nonresonant component. Using the fit fractions from this analysis, partial branching ratios are updated with higher precision than previous measurements.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G.

The emission features alpha, beta, gamma, and delta originating from the FePc molecules in UPS spectra are located at 3.42, 5.04, 7.36, and 10.28 eV below Fermi level. The feature a is mostly deriving from Fe 3d orbital with some contributions from C 2p orbital. A considerable charge transfer from the Cu substrate to the Fe 3d orbital occurs upon the adsorption of FePc molecules. The angle-resolved UPS measurements indicate that FePc molecules adopt lying-down configurations with their molecular plane nearly parallel to the Cu(110) substrate at monolayer stage. In combination with the DFT calculations, the adsorption structure is determined to be that FePc molecule adsorbs on the top site of Cu(110) with an angle of 45 degrees between the lobes of FePc and the [1 (1) over bar0] azimuth of the substrate.

Our objective was to determine the health status of the Chinese population by investigating IM and LE and their inter-relationship. Material/Methods: Based on a literature review on the history and current status of IM and LE in China and other major countries, the relationship between IM, LE, and per capita gross national income (GNI) was investigated in 2013. Results: The decline in IM from 30% to 15% took China only 7 years, which was faster than in developed countries. The leading causes of infant death in China were perinatal diseases, infectious and parasitic diseases, congenital anomalies, accidents, and signs, symptoms, and ill-defined conditions. Most under-5 mortality occurred during infancy (80%), particularly during the neonatal period (55%). LE was negatively correlated with IM (r=-0.921, P<0.001) and per capita GNI (r=0.778, P<0.001), while IM was negatively correlated with per capita GNI (r=-0.735, P<0.001). However, healthcare capabilities and per capita GNI in China are still below the level of developing countries. Some countries have a comparable IM and healthcare capabilities, but they have a much higher per capita GNI than China. Conclusions: In China, IM has decreased and IE increased rapidly. However, they were not in parallel with the current economic development. Deviation of these data might be attributed to many factors. In-house surveys and hospital-based follow-ups should be carried out to better understand infant death.

J	Chen, GF; Sheu, JS				Chen, Gen-Fang; Sheu, Jia-Shing			An optical music recognition system for traditional Chinese Kunqu Opera scores written in Gong-Che Notation	EURASIP JOURNAL ON AUDIO SPEECH AND MUSIC PROCESSING			English	Article						Optical music recognition; Kunqu Opera; Gong-Che Notation; MIDI; Classifiers	CHARACTER-RECOGNITION; SEGMENTATION; TRANSFORMATION; EXTRACTION	This paper presents an optical music recognition (OMR) system to process the handwritten musical scores of Kunqu Opera written in Gong-Che Notation (GCN). First, it introduces the background of Kunqu Opera and GCN. Kunqu Opera is one of the oldest forms of musical activity, spanning the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries, and GCN has been the most popular notation for recording musical works in China since the seventh century. Many Kunqu Operas that use GCN are available as original manuscripts or photocopies, and transforming these versions into a machine-readable format is a pressing need. The OMR system comprises six stages: image pre-processing, segmentation, feature extraction, symbol recognition, musical semantics, and musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) representation. This paper focuses on the symbol recognition stage and obtains the musical information with Bayesian, genetic algorithm, and K-nearest neighbor classifiers. The experimental results indicate that symbol recognition for Kunqu Opera's handwritten musical scores is effective. This work will help to preserve and popularize Chinese cultural heritage and to store Kunqu Opera scores in a machine-readable format, thereby ensuring the possibility of spreading and performing original Kunqu Opera musical scores.

Observation of e(+)e(-) -> gamma X(3872) at BESIII	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								With data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring at center-of-mass energies from 4.009 to 4.420 GeV, the process e(+)e(-) -> gamma X(3872) is observed for the first time with a statistical significance of 6.3 sigma. The measured mass of the X(3872) is (3871.9 +/- 0.7(stat) +/- 0.2(syst)) MeV/c(2), in agreement with previous measurements. Measurements of the product of the cross section sigma[e(+)e(-) -> gamma X(3872)] and the branching fraction B [X(3872) -> pi(+)pi(-)J/psi] at center-of-mass energies 4.009, 4.229, 4.260, and 4.360 GeV are reported. Our measurements are consistent with expectations for the radiative transition process Y(4260) -> gamma X(3872).	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J.

In addition, we found that overexpression of PTRF increased the number of caveolae and induced cellular senescence. Unresponsiveness to growth factor is one of the fundamental characteristics of senescent cells, although normal levels of receptors and downstream signalling molecules are present in senescent cells. Herein, we investigated the role of PTRF in the regulation of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signalling in young and senescent cells. We first confirmed that PTRF was upregulated in senescent human fibroblasts and aged mouse tissues. We then examined the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) in young and senescent cells after PDGF stimulation. Our results show that expression of PDGF receptors (PDGFRs) was not altered during cellular senescence. Interestingly, phosphorylation of ERK1/2 was induced upon PDGF stimulation of young, replicating cells but not senescent cells. Induction of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was impaired in senescent cells and PTRF-overexpressing presenescent cells. Furthermore, our results show that PTRF interacts with PDGFRs and this interaction is increased in senescent cells. These results suggest that the unresponsiveness of senescent fibroblasts to PDGF stimulation may be due to increased levels of PTRF and the formation of caveolae, which, in turn sequester growth receptors, such as PDGFR and its signalling molecules.

The main functions of this system include house design, house decoration, and data management. For the house design, an automatic joint method of the walls is proposed, in order to design various house. For the house decoration, we introduce the wall decoration principle corresponding to the algorithm of discretization on the walls, which contains doors or windows, and triangularization on the irregular floors. To variety of different textures and collage regulations, we provide a new texture collage mapping method. Technology of rendering to texture is used to generate a small geometry texture, which will be mapped into a large target object on the basis of the texture's structural properties. As a result, the whole texture continuity is also maintained.

Effect of water stress on yield and nutrition quality of tomato plant overexpressing StAPX	BIOLOGIA PLANTARUM			English	Article						chlorophyll; H2O2 scavenging; net photosynthetic rate; proline; Solanum lycopersicum; sugars; thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase	BOUND ASCORBATE PEROXIDASE; PHOTOSYNTHESIS; LEAVES	We investigated the effect of water stress on yield and quality of tomato plants overexpressing Solanum lycopersicum thylakoid-bound ascorbate peroxidase gene (StAPX). APX activity, hydrogen peroxide content, net photosynthetic rate of tomato leaves, and yield and nutrition quality of tomato fruits were measured under soil moisture 70, 60, and 50 % of full field capacity. Results show that the capability of APX for scavenging hydrogen peroxide induced by water stress was higher in the transgenic than the wild type (WT) plants. The yield of fruits of the transgenic tomato plants was higher than that of WT plants under water stress and the fruit nutrition quality was not different. These results indicate that overexpression of StAPX might improve water stress tolerance in the transgenic tomato plants.

As the gymnosperms of conifer woody plants, Pinus massoniana (AR-sensitive) and Taxus wallichiana var. mairei (AR-resistant) are widely distributed in southern China. Under AR stress, significant necrosis and collapsed lesions were found in P. massoniana needles with remarkable yellowing and wilting tips, whereas T. wallichiana var. mairei did not exhibit chlorosis and visible damage. Due to the activation of a large number of stress-related genes and the synthesis of various functional proteins to counteract AR stress, it is important to study the differences in AR-tolerance mechanisms by comparative proteomic analysis of tolerant and sensitive species. This study revealed a total of 65 and 26 differentially expressed proteins that were identified in P. massoniana and T. wallichiana var. mairei, respectively. Among them, proteins involved in metabolism, photosynthesis, signal transduction and transcription were drastically down-regulated in P. massoniana, whereas most of the proteins participating in metabolism, cell structure, photosynthesis and transcription were increased in T. wallichiana var. mairei. These results suggest the distinct patterns of protein expression in the two woody species in response to AR, allowing a deeper understanding of diversity on AR tolerance in forest tree species.

Cerebellum engages in automation of verb-generation skill	JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Cerebellum; functional MRI; verb generation; skill learning	FUNCTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; BASAL GANGLIA; ACTIVATION; ANATOMY; MOTOR; INVOLVEMENT; SYSTEM; MECHANISMS	Numerous studies have shown cerebellar involvement in item-specific association, a form of explicit learning. However, very few have demonstrated cerebellar participation in automation of non-motor cognitive tasks. Applying fMRI to a repeated verb-generation task, we sought to distinguish cerebellar involvement in learning of item-specific noun-verb association and automation of verb generation skill. The same set of nouns was repeated in six verb-generation blocks so that subjects practiced generating verbs for the nouns. The practice was followed by a novel block with a different set of nouns. The cerebellar vermis (IV/ V) and the right cerebellar lobule VI showed decreased activation following practice; activation in the right cerebellar Crus I was significantly lower in the novel challenge than in the initial verb-generation task. Furthermore, activation in this region during well-practiced blocks strongly correlated with improvement of behavioral performance in both the well-practiced and the novel blocks, suggesting its role in the learning of general mental skills not specific to the practiced noun-verb pairs. Therefore, the cerebellum processes both explicit verbal associative learning and automation of cognitive tasks. Different cerebellar regions predominate in this processing: lobule VI during the acquisition of item-specific association, and Crus I during automation of verb-generation skills through practice.

Cav-1 deletion impaired hematopoietic stem cell function	CELL DEATH & DISEASE			English	Article						Cav-1; HSC; quiescence	LIFE-SPAN; B-CELL; CAVEOLIN-1; MAINTENANCE; CAVIN; QUIESCENCE; MECHANISMS; NICHE; GENE; MICE	A tightly controlled balance between hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell compartments is required to maintain normal blood cell homeostasis throughout life, and this balance is regulated by intrinsic and extrinsic cellular factors. Cav-1 is a 22-kDa protein that is located in plasma membrane invaginations and is implicated in regulating neural stem cell and embryonic stem cell proliferation. However, the role of Cav-1 in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) function is largely unknown. In this study, we used Cav-1(-/-) mice to investigate the role of Cav-1 in HSCs function during aging. The results showed that Cav-1(-/-) mice displayed a decreased percentage of B cells and an increased percentage of M cells in the bone marrow and peripheral blood, and these changes were due to an increased number of HSCs. FACS analysis showed that the numbers of Lin(-)Sca1(+)c-kit(+) cells (LSKs), long-term HSCs (LT-HSCs), short-term HSCs and multipotent progenitors were increased in Cav-1(-/-) mice compared with Cav-1(+/+) mice, and this increase became more pronounced with aging. An in vitro clonogenic assay showed that LT-HSCs from Cav-1(-/-) mice had reduced ability to self-renew. Consistently, an in vivo competitive transplantation assay showed that Cav-1(-/-) mice failed to reconstitute hematopoiesis. Moreover, a Cav-1 deletion disrupted the quiescence of LSKs and promoted cell cycle progression through G2/M phase. In addition, we found that Cav-1 deletion impaired the ability of HSCs to differentiate into mature blood cells. Taken together, these data suggest that Cav-1-deficient cells impaired HSCs quiescence and induced environmental alterations, which limited HSCs self-renewal and function.

Based on satellite-measured night-time light data and the normalized difference vegetation index, a human settlement index was used to represent the current urban land cover and define three urban land subcategories in the UCM. Three numerical simulations representing different urbanization scenarios and an idealized simulation with all the urban surface replaced with cropland were performed. Using up-to-date urban land use data, the coupled WRF/UCM model reasonably reproduced the majority of the observed spatial and temporal characteristics of the 2-m temperature field over the simulation period in Hangzhou. Strong UHI effects that can cause intensification and expansion of the areas experiencing extreme heat stress were observed in both actual measurements and simulations. In the simulation, an average temperature increase of 0.74 degrees C in the city center was observed under high urbanization conditions. The UHI peak reached a maximum value of 1.6 degrees C at 1900 LST around sunset. Analysis of the surface energy balance showed that the UHI is mainly caused by a greater heat storage in the urban fabric during the day and the release of this heat in the evening. Comparisons among the results of four sensitivity runs showed that urban land use, classification of three urban land subcategories, and consideration of anthropogenic heat release respectively contributed 56.8% (0.42 degrees C), 13.5% (0.10 degrees C), and 29.7% (0.22 degrees C) to the simulated UHI effects.

If it takes place in a given tissue or organ prematurely ahead of other tissues and organs, it causes pathological development of diseases. How to treat aging cells and associated molecules is a challenge in anti-aging research. It has been demonstrated recently that aging occurs under physiological conditions during embryonic development of mammals, and that to some life forms aging never occurs. Involved in diverse diseases, aging is difficult to be measured and does not have universal markers. It is thus essential to comprehend the types of cells that undergo aging in human diseases and thereby the underlying molecular mechanisms. This article discusses recent research advances including: (1) The concept, classification and relevant mechanisms of cell aging; (2) Physiological aging: Developmentally programmed senescence; (3) Tissue homeostasis and aging; (4) Cell replicative senescence and related diseases: telomeres and cancer prognosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, hypertension; (5) Non-replicative cell aging and related diseases: Parkinson disease and diabetes; (6) Species diversity in aging and longevity.

Growing evidences show that the ageing of the immune system is initiated at the very top of the hematopoietic hierarchy and the ageing of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) directly affect the function of the immune system. However, molecule mechanisms underlies HSC ageing is still unclear.

Does thermoregulatory behavior also occur in the embryos of other reptile and bird species? Our experiments show that such behavior is widespread but not universal in reptile and bird embryos. We recorded repositioning within the egg, in response to thermal gradients, in the embryos of three species of snakes (Xenochrophis piscator, Elaphe bimaculata, and Zaocys dhumnades), two turtles (Chelydra serpentina and Ocadia sinensis), one crocodile (Alligator sinensis), and four birds (Coturnix coturnix, Gallus gallus domesticus, Columba livia domestica, and Anas platyrhynchos domestica). However, we detected no significant thermoregulation by the embryos of two lizard species (Takydromus septentrionalis and Phrynocephalus frontalis). Overall, embryonic thermoregulatory behavior is widespread in reptile as well as bird species but may be unimportant in the small eggs laid by most lizards.

Self-management of Chemotherapy-Related Nausea and Vomiting A Cross-sectional Survey of Chinese Cancer Patients	CANCER NURSING			English	Article						Nausea and vomiting; Self-management; Chemotherapy; Chinese cancer patients	SYMPTOM MANAGEMENT; CARE PRACTICES; VALIDATION; ILLNESS; ADULTS; DISTRESS	Background: Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) remain prevalent among cancer patients despite pharmacological advances in CINV therapy. Patients can initiate nonpharmacologic strategies, which potentially play an important role as adjuncts to pharmacological agents in alleviating CINV. Some studies have explored nausea and vomiting self-management (NVSM) behaviors among patients in Western settings; however, little is known about the NVSM behaviors of patients in China. Objectives: This study examines NVSM behaviors of Chinese cancer patients. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted in a specialist cancer hospital in southeast China. Results: A sample of 255 cancer patients was recruited. A mean of 8.56 (+/- 3.15) NVSM behaviors was reported. Most NVSM behaviors were rated as moderately effective and were implemented with moderate self-efficacy. Higher distress levels, better functional status, previous similar symptom experiences, receiving chemotherapy as an inpatient, and greater support from multiple levels were related to greater engagement in NVSM; higher self-efficacy levels pertaining to NVSM behaviors were associated with reports of more relief from specific NVSM behaviors. Conclusions: A range of NVSM strategies was initiated by Chinese cancer patients and provided some relief. A range of individual, health status, and environmental factors influenced engagement with and relief from NVSM behaviors. Implications for Practice: To enhance Chinese patients' NVSM, patients should be supported to engage in behaviors including taking antiemetics, modifying their diet, using psychological strategies, and creating a pleasant environment. The findings highlight the importance of enhancing patients' self-efficacy in NVSM, alleviating symptom distress, and improving social support to achieve better outcomes.

The snake is listed as a vulnerable species according to the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals. To develop effective conservation strategies for the snake, we need a better understanding of gene flow, population structure and evolutionary history of this species by using kinds of molecular markers such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci. Here, we characterize 12 polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from E. carinata genomic libraries. One hundred and thirty-one individuals were collected from three geographically distant populations: Ji'an (Jiangxi, N26A degrees 59'30aEuro(3), E114A degrees 58'58aEuro(3)), Quanzhou (Guangxi, N25A degrees 44'20aEuro(3), E111A degrees 6'48aEuro(3)), Zhijiang (Hunan, N27A degrees 20'36aEuro(3), E109A degrees 8'46aEuro(3)). These markers revealed a high degree of genetic diversity (6-20 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (H (O) ranged from 0.326 to 0.894, and H (E) ranged from 0.542 to 0.918). No locus exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci. These microsatellite markers will be useful for the study of gene flow, population structure and evolutionary history of E. carinata.

In this study, we used Phrynocephalus vlangalii females kept under seven thermal regimes for the whole gestation period to test the hypothesis that viviparity in high-altitude Phrynocephalus lizards is adaptive because embryos cannot fully develop without maternal thermoregulation. All females at 24 A degrees C and 93 % of the females at 28 A degrees C failed to give birth or produced stillborns, and proportionally fewer females gave birth at 29 or 35 A degrees C than at 32 A degrees C. Though the daily temperatures encountered were unsuitable for embryonic development, 95 % of the females in nature and 89 % of the females thermoregulating in the laboratory gave birth. There was no shift in the thermal preferences of females when they were pregnant. Although thermal conditions inside natural burrows were unsuitable for embryonic development, mass and sprint speed were both greater in neonates produced in nature. Our data show that (1) long-term exposure of P. vlangalii embryos to temperatures outside the range of 29-35 A degrees C may result in the failure of development, but daily or short-term exposure may not necessarily increase embryonic mortality; (2) low gestation temperatures slow but do not arrest embryonic development, and females produce high-quality offspring in the shortest possible time by maintaining gestation temperatures close to the upper thermal limit for embryonic development; and (3) viviparity is currently adaptive at high elevations because embryos in nature cannot fully develop without relying on maternal thermoregulation. Our data validate the hypothesis tested.

The parent compound SrFBiS2 is found to possess a semiconductor-like ground state, with a thermal activation energy Eg similar to 38 meV. By the partial substitution of La for Sr, superconductivity emerges when x > 0: 3, reaching its maximal superconducting transition temperature of T-c similar to 3: 5 K at x D 0: 55. In the normal state of superconducting samples, it is clearly seen that there exists a crossover from the metallic to the semiconducting state below a temperature T-min, which shifts to lower temperatures with increasing La content.

This biphasic dose response phenomenon has the potential to strongly alter toxicology in a broad range. The present review focuses on the progress of research into hormetic responses in terms of growth (in plants, birds, algae and humans), bioluminescence, and shoal behavior as end points. The paper describes how both inorganic and organic chemicals at a low dose show stimulatory responses while at higher doses are inhibitory. The article highlights how factors such as symbiosis, density-dependent factors, time, and contrasting environmental factors (availability of nutrients, temperature, light, etc.) affect both the range and amplitude of hormetic responses. Furthermore, the possible underlying mechanisms are also discussed and we suggest that, for every end point, different hormetic mechanisms may exist. The occurrences of varying interacting receptor systems or receptor systems affecting the assessment of hormesis for each endpoint are discussed. The present review suggests that a hormetic model should be adopted for toxicological evaluations instead of the older threshold and linear non-threshold models. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods: We constructed an RIG-I expression vector and co-transfected it into Huh-7 cells along with HCV-replicon RNA. We assayed HCV replication and NS5A protein synthesis via real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and western blotting. Also, we performed an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to measure the level of interferon (IFN)-alpha/-beta secretion. Additionally, we examined, via western blotting, the phosphorylation state of p38, Erk1/2, and nuclear factor (NF)-kB p65. Results: Overexpression of RIG-1 in Huh-7 cells co-transfected with an HCV-replicon RNA significantly inhibited HCV replication and NS5A protein synthesis. Co-transfected cells had increased production of IFN- alpha/-beta production and had higher levels of phosphorylated p38, Erk1/2, and NF-kB p65. Conclusions: RIG-I significantly inhibits HCV replication and NS5A protein synthesis by inducing type I IFN production. The underlying molecular mechanism for this effect appears to be mediated by increased phosphorylation of NF-kB p65, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), and Erk1/2.

Se-1 shows high selectivity and sensitivity toward Hg2+ and Cu2+ over alkali and transition metal ions. Se-1 shows a significant red-shift in the absorption spectra from 525 to 571 nm for Hg2+ and 590 nm for Cu2+, which induces color changes from pink to purple and blue. Upon excitation at 570 nm, Se-1 upon interaction with Hg2+ ions displays a 5-fold fluorescence enhancement with a 2 nm blue-shift, while Se-1 with Cu2+ exhibits a 13-fold fluorescence enhancement and red-shifts from 595 to 610 nm. The binding mode of Se-1 with Hg2+ or Cu2+ has been investigated by Job's plot, ESI and H-1 NMR experiments. The absorption and fluorescence of the Se-1-Hg2+ complex can be reversibly restored to that of the uncomplexed ligand by using EDTA or cysteine, however, the sensing processing of Se-1 in response to Cu2+ ions cannot.

Two pairs of degenerate primers were used to separate seven conserve partial sequences by semi-nest touch-down PCR. One of them showed similarity with aldehyde dehydrogenase was used as a target fragment for isolating full-length sequence. The full-length mg-MSDH sequence contained a 1,473 bp coding sequence encoding a 490-amino-acid polypeptide and assigned an accession number JQ715422 in Genbank. The upstream sequences TAGGAG of the start codon (GTG), suggested that was a ribosome binding site. The coding sequence of mg-MSDH was ligated to pET-303 vector and the reconstructive plasmid was successfully overexpressed in E. coli. The purified recombinant mg-MSDH enzyme showed propionaldehyde oxidative activity of 3.0 U mg(-1) at 37 A degrees C.

A Data-Driven Algorithm Integrating Clinical and Laboratory Features for the Diagnosis and Prognosis of Necrotizing Enterocolitis	PLOS ONE			English	Article							BIRTH-WEIGHT INFANTS; ISOLATED INTESTINAL PERFORATION; NEONATAL-RESEARCH-NETWORK; OUTCOMES; COHORT	Background: Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a major source of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Since there is no specific diagnostic test or risk of progression model available for NEC, the diagnosis and outcome prediction of NEC is made on clinical grounds. The objective in this study was to develop and validate new NEC scoring systems for automated staging and prognostic forecasting. Study design: A six-center consortium of university based pediatric teaching hospitals prospectively collected data on infants under suspicion of having NEC over a 7-year period. A database comprised of 520 infants was utilized to develop the NEC diagnostic and prognostic models by dividing the entire dataset into training and testing cohorts of demographically matched subjects. Developed on the training cohort and validated on the blind testing cohort, our multivariate analyses led to NEC scoring metrics integrating clinical data. Results: Machine learning using clinical and laboratory results at the time of clinical presentation led to two NEC models: (1) an automated diagnostic classification scheme; (2) a dynamic prognostic method for risk-stratifying patients into low, intermediate and high NEC scores to determine the risk for disease progression. We submit that dynamic risk stratification of infants with NEC will assist clinicians in determining the need for additional diagnostic testing and guide potential therapies in a dynamic manner.

Here, we report the geometric structures and electronic properties of the two-dimensional SiC3 sheet by the particle-swarm optimization method and density functional calculations. The unbiased global search reveals three lowest-energy structures for SiC3 ones, all of which are Si-graphene hybrid honeycomb lattices with robust dynamical stabilities. Depending on the ordered arrangement of Si atoms, the SiC3 sheets could be direct-band-gap semiconductors or zero-band-gap semimetals. More interestingly, the semiconducting SiC3 sheet has a strong adsorption ability in the visible-light region, and the semimetallic one even possesses a distorted Dirac cone, which induces an anisotropic Fermi velocity. These rich electronic properties of SiC3 nanosheets endow the system with promising applications in nanoelectronics and photovoltaics.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Electronic structures of reconstructed zigzag silicene nanoribbons	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							GRAPHENE NANORIBBONS; EDGE	Edge states and magnetism are crucial for spintronic applications of nanoribbons. Here, using first-principles calculations, we explore structural stabilities and electronic properties of zigzag silicene nanoribbons (ZSiNRs) with Klein and pentagon-heptagon reconstructions. Comparing to unreconstructed zigzag edges, deformed bare pentagon-heptagon ones are favored under H-poor conditions, while H-rich surroundings stabilize di-hydrogenated Klein edges. These Klein edges have analogous magnetism to zigzag ones, which also possess the electric-field-induced half-metallicity of nanoribbons. Moreover, diverse magnetic states can be achieved by asymmetric Klein and zigzag edges into ZSiNRs, which could be transformed from antiferromagnetic-semiconductors to bipolar spin-gapless-semiconductors and ferromagnetic-metals depending on edge hydrogenations.

One of the widest applied recommendation methods is the Matrix Factorization (MF). However, most of the researches on this topic have focused on mining the direct relationships between users and items. In this paper, we optimize the standard MF by integrating the user clustering regularization term. Our model considers not only the user-item rating information but also the user information. In addition, we compared the proposed model with three typical other methods: User-Mean (UM), Item-Mean (IM) and standard MF. Experimental results on two real-world datasets, MovieLens 1M and MovieLens 100k, show that our method performs better than other three methods in the accuracy of recommendation.

During composting, the concentration of extractable kitasamycin in kitasamycin-contaminated composts declined rapidly, and was undetectable in M2 within 15 days. M2 also achieved the highest fertility compost, which was characterised by the following final parameters: electrical conductivity, 2.34 dS cm(-1); pH, 8.15; total C/N, 22.2; water-soluble NH4+, P, and K, 0.37, 3.43, and 1.05 g kg(-1), respectively; and plant germination index values, 92%. Furthermore, DGGE analysis showed a dramatic increase in the diversity of bacterial species during composting. In contrast, a high concentration (121 mg kg(-1)) of extractable kitasamycin still remained in the M3 compost, which exerted an inhibitory effect on the composting, resulting in reduced bacterial diversity, high values of electrical conductivity and water-soluble NH4+, a low C/N ratio, and a low plant germination index value. Furthermore, 3.86 log (CFU g(-1)) kitasamycin-resistant bacteria were still present on day 40, indicating the biological degradation contributed to the decline of extractable kitasamycin.

However, there is virtually no information on the effects of high level Zinc (Zn) pollution on aphids and ladybirds. The high concentrations of Zn2+ or Zn pollution inhibit reproduction in the phytophagous aphid, Aphis medicaginis, and the predatory ladybird Harmonia axyridis could provide important information. Results: It was observed in this study that Zn concentrations in Vicia faba (broad bean) seeds and seedlings in all Zn2+ treatments were significantly higher than that in the control group, and increased with increasing Zn2+ concentrations in the solution. The rate of reproduction in A. medicaginis declined significantly (p<0.05) over time in the five groups fed on broad bean seedlings treated with different concentrations of Zn2+ solution compared with the control group. These results showed that higher concentrations of Zn2+ significantly inhibited the reproductive capacity of A. medicaginis. We also cloned and identified a gene encoding vitellogenin (Vg) from A. medicaginis, which has an important role in vitellogenesis, and therefore, reproduction was affected by exposure to Zn2+. Expression of AmVg was reduced with increasing exposure to Zn2+ and also in the F-1-F-3 generations of aphids exposed to different Zn2+ concentrations. Predation by H. axyridis was also reduced in aphids exposed to high-levels of Zn2+. Similarly, ovipositioning by H. axyridis was also reduced. Conclusions: Our results suggest that Zn2+ can significantly affect the reproductive capacity of both A. medicaginis and its predator H. axyridis, the former through effects on the expression of AmVg and the latter through avoidance of aphids containing high levels of Zn2+.

Its feasibility was proved by the Lasalle principle. Numerical simulation results show that synaptic connection weight can converge to an appropriate strength and the network comes to synchronization. Furthermore, ISI (inter-spike interval) of synchronization orbit in neural network has a typical period doubling bifurcation. It is a further improvement compared with bifurcation of the traditional single neuron model, which promotes our understanding of neuron population activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, those exhibiting outstanding electroluminescence properties are still rare. In this work, bulky 9,9-dimethylfluorenyl, 9,9-diphenylfluorenyl, and 9,9'-spirobifluorenyl substituents were introduced into the 2,5-positions of silole rings. The resulting 2,5-difluorenyl-substituted siloles are thermally stable and have low-lying LUMO energy levels. Crystallographic analysis revealed that intramolecular pi-pi interactions are prone to form between 9,9'-spirobifluorene units and phenyl rings at the 3,4-positions of the silole ring. In the solution state, these new siloles show weak blue and green emission bands, arising from the fluorenyl groups and silole rings with a certain ex-tension of pi conjugation, respectively. With increasing substituent volume, intramolecular rotation is decreased, and thus the emissions of the present siloles gradually improved and they showed higher fluorescence quantum yields (Phi(F) = 2.5-5.4 %) than 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsiloles. They are highly emissive in solid films, with dominant green to yellow emissions and good solid-state Phi(F) values (75-88%). Efficient organic light-emitting diodes were fabricated by adopting them as host emitters and gave high luminance, current efficiency, and power efficiency of up to 44 100 cdm(-2), 18.3 cdA(-1), and 15.7 lmW(-1), respectively. Notably, a maximum external quantum efficiency of 5.5% was achieved in an optimized device.

J	Kira, M				Kira, Mitsuo			Importance of pi-sigma* Orbital Mixing in Bonding and Structure of Bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilane and Related Compounds	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							STRETCH ISOMERISM; AB-INITIO; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; NON-KEKULE; RING; SILICON; ANALOGS; MOLECULES; GERMANIUM; CHEMISTRY	The structural diversity of bicyclo[1.1.0]tetrasilane has been analyzed using perturbation MO theory and DFT calculations. Among its four planar-cis (C-2v), planar-trans (C-2h), long-bond (C-2v) and short-bond isomers (C-2v) found theoretically, the first two are derived as the results of second-order Jahn-Teller distortion of the D-2h isomer associated with the pi-sigma* orbital mixing. The last two are formed through orbital mixing in an isomer with a folded ring. The orbital mixing of the two sigma*(Si-H) orbitals at the 1- and 3-silicon atoms into a, pi-type orbital between the atoms plays a crucial role in stabilizing the system by causing pyramidalization at the silicon atoms and by introducing the inverted sigma-bond nature between the atoms. The pi-sigma* orbital mixing model is applied to predicting the structure of related compounds.

This strategy is based on the copper-catalyzed C-N coupling of 2-haloaryltriazenes or 2-haloazo compounds with sodium azide and the intramolecular addition of nitrene to N=N bonds. This approach allows the synthesis of various N-amino- and N-aryl-2H-benzotriazoles in water, in good to excellent yields. The procedure is simple and the starting materials and catalyst are easily available, offering a practical and convenient synthetic route to 2-substituted benzotriazoles.

However, the function of Gadd45a in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remains unknown. Here, we reported that Gadd45a-deficient (Gadd45a(-/-)) mice showed a normal hematologic phenotype under homeostatic conditions. However, following 5-fluorouracil treatment, Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs exhibited a faster recovery, associated with an increase in the proliferation rate. Interestingly, young Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs showed enhanced reconstitution ability in serial transplantation. Following ionizing radiation (IR), young Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs exhibited an increased resistance to IR-induced DNA damage, associated with a decrease in the apoptosis rate and delayed DNA repair. The significantly higher level of DNA damage in Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs ultimately promoted B-cell leukemia in further transplanted recipient mice. In old mice, Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs were functionally equal to wild-type HSCs but exhibited more DNA damage accumulation and increased sensitivity to IR than wild-type HSCs. In conclusion, Gadd45a plays a significant role in HSC stress responses. Gadd45a deficiency leads to DNA damage accumulation and impairment in apoptosis after exposure to IR, which increases the susceptibility of leukemogenesis.

The titania was designed to be highly dispersed on the functional material and then the Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles were formed in uniform size and shape under mild conditions. The experimental results reveal that the nanosilver catalysts (the fabricated Ag@TiO2 located on the PMHSIPNs, namely, nanoAg@TiO2@PMHSIPN) have enhanced catalytic activities in the alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones or alpha, beta-unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones with terminal alkynes. In this reaction, the hybrid Ag@TiO2 nanoparticles exhibited a high level of catalytic activity for the selective 1,2-alkynylation of various trifluoromethyl ketones and alpha, beta-unsaturated trifluoromethyl ketones into a wide range of fluorinated alcohols in water. Finally, on the basis of the nanoAg@TiO2@PMHSIPN-catalyzed alkynylation of trifluoromethyl ketones, we developed a new concept whereby highly reactive substrates act as a "reactive tractor" or "reactive springboard" to drive the transformation of poorly reactive substrates as springboard chemistry. Consequently, we found that trifluoromethyl ketone can be used as an efficient additive in the nanosilver-catalyzed alkynylation of aldehydes.

Compared with the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 3.42 kg N m(-3) day(-1) in the control bioreactor (ICDR) without IC, the peak NRR reached 21.0 kg N m(-3) day(-1) in the reactor (ICAR) with sufficient IC added. It was revealed that the long-term addition of bicarbonate significantly enhanced the performance of the ANAMMOX reactor. The optimum HCO3 (-)/TN ratio was considered to be 1.20, which is lower than that in normal conditions. The IC concentration affected biomass activity, and the transient addition or removal of IC to differing sludge media caused a significant loss of activity. Sufficient addition of IC alleviated the inhibition of excess substrates, while the inhibition was aggravated by the IC limitation. The half-maximal (50 %) inhibitory concentrations of substrate for the sludge were 295 mg L-1 NO2 (-)-N and 361 mg L-1 NH4 (+)-N with 120 mg L-1 of fixed HCO3 (-) and 346 mg L-1 NO2 (-)-N and 456 mg L-1 NH4 (+)-N with unlimited IC, respectively. Changing the HCO3 (-)/TN (in milligrams per milligram) ratio resulted in the variation of ANAMMOX stoichiometric ratios. Sludge characterization parameters in the ICDR, including biomass, extracellular polymeric substances, heme C, and so on, were lower than those in ICAR. Filamentous bacteria and spherical bacteria were also observed in the reactor with limited IC.

We used in vivo bio-orthogonal noncanonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) with the methionine analog azidohomoalanine (AHA) combined with the multidimensional protein identification technique (MudPIT) to identify proteins that are synthesized in the tadpole brain over 24 hr. We induced conditioning-dependent plasticity of visual avoidance behavior, which required N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and Ca2+-permeable alpha-Amino-3-hydroxy-5methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors, alpha CaMKII, and rapid protein synthesis. Combining BONCAT with western blots revealed that proteins includinga alpha CaMKII, MEK1, CPEB, and GAD65 are synthesized during conditioning. Acute synthesis of CPEB during conditioning is required for behavioral plasticity as well as conditioning-induced synaptic and structural plasticity in the tectal circuit. We outline a signaling pathway that regulates protein-synthesisdependent behavioral plasticity in intact animals, identify newly synthesized proteins induced by visual experience, and demonstrate a requirement for acute synthesis of CPEB in plasticity.

H.; Pan, Zhigeng; Wang, Jiang; Song, Haiyu			An Eigen-based motion retrieval method for real-time animation	COMPUTERS & GRAPHICS-UK			English	Article						Eigenspace retrieval; Motion retrieval; Real-time animation; Real-time motion retrieval		Research on real-time 3D animation is attracting a lot of attention in recent years due to the popularity of emerging applications such as distributed virtual environments and computer games. One of the important issues in real-time animation is that the existing motion retrieval techniques generally have a high matching time because they are typically based on matching time-series, making them less suitable for use with large motion databases. In this paper, we propose a different approach to motion retrieval, called Eigen-based Motion Retrieval (or EigenMR), to address this limitation of the existing methods by performing motion retrieval in the transform domain instead of the time domain. To differentiate the motion of different body parts, we propose to perform the matching on individual body parts as well as on the whole body. Our approach has the important advantage that each body part can be represented by an index of fixed size, consisting of a number of eigenvectors and the corresponding eigenvalues. As a result, our approach has constant time complexity based on the number of motion files in the database instead of the size of the database. The experimental results show that our approach is both efficient and accurate compared with some of the latest methods. When applied to a motion database of 4 GB in size, our method requires approximately 20% of the standard time, making it more suitable for real-time animation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper extends circular helical curves to general tubular shapes and proposes a novel method for measuring their length and girth. We call the extended circular helixes quasi-helical curves. A formal definition, as well as a set of practical algorithms for quasi-helixes, is presented in this paper. Experimental results demonstrate that our method is fast, intrinsic, insensitive to noises, invariant to triangulation and resolution. Furthermore, quasi-helical curves can also be used in classifying 3D shapes and designing vector fields on surfaces of revolution. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It was initially cultivated in medium mixed with 2% (w/v) rabbit faeces. Subsequently, two chemically defined media, designated CA-1 and CA-2, were found to be suitable for axenical cultivation of the ciliate. The maximum abundance of the ciliate isolate in the CA media was 1-2 x 10(5) cells/ml. The ciliate isolate was further identified with silver impregnation and molecular analysis. Features of the left oral polykinetid, somatic dikinetids, and sliverline pattern were similar to those of Colpoda asp era as described by Foissner (1993). The 18S small subunit ribosomal RNA gene of the ciliate isolate shared 99% sequence identity with that of C. aspera, with 100% coverage, and formed a sister clade in the phylogenetic tree with the reference C. aspera isolate. In addition, the trophozoite of C. aspera could proliferate over a temperature range from 25-37 degrees C. When resting cysts were cultivated in CA-1 medium at 30-35 degrees C, 98.2% of the trophozoites were detached from the cyst wall after 7 h. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, XH; Wu, WG; Ding, J				Chen, Xi-Hua; Wu, Wen-Guang; Ding, Jian			Aberrant TIG1 methylation associated with its decreased expression and clinicopathological significance in hepatocellular carcinoma	TUMOR BIOLOGY			English	Article						TIG1; Methylation; MSP; Prognosis	TAZAROTENE-INDUCED GENE-1; RETINOID RESPONSE GENE; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR; DOWN-REGULATION; HYPERMETHYLATION; CANCER	Recently, it has been reported that tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) methylation was frequently detected in a variety of human cancers. However, the relationship between the TIG1 methylation and the characteristics of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) remains unknown. The aim of present study was to observe the promoter methylation of TIG1 in HCC tissues and assess its prognostic significance for HCC. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction and methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction were used, respectively, to examine the mRNA expression and methylation status of TIG1 in 91 pairs of HCC and adjacent noncancerous tissues. The mRNA expression level of TIG1 was significantly lower in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues. The rate of TIG1 promoter methylation was significantly higher in HCC tissues than in adjacent noncancerous tissues (P < 0.001). A strong correlation between downregulation and promoter methylation was found in these tumors (P < 0.001). More importantly, TIG1 methylation status was related to tumor size (P = 0.015), histological differentiation (P = 0.004), and tumor stage (P < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that TIG1 promoter hypermethylation was associated with a worse outcome in patients with HCC. Further, Cox multivariate analysis indicated that TIG1 methylation status was an independent prognostic factor for the overall survival rate of HCC patients. In conclusion, our data suggested that epigenetic silencing of TIG1 gene expression by promoter hypermethylation may play an important role in HCC.

However, GTPs levels are maintained relatively low in the blood and are chemically-unstable. Lipid-soluble tea polyphenols (LTPs) are products of modified GTPs with ester linkage with fatty acids. LTPs are lipophilic and expected to provide improved absorption and utilization in the body compared with water-soluble polyphenols. The current study was designed to investigate the chemo-preventive property and the possible mechanisms of LTP action against diethylnitrosamine (DEN)-induced liver cancer in rats. Materials and Methods: Oral administration of LTPs at doses of 0, 40, and 400 mg/kg/day was initiated 2 weeks prior to DEN injection and was continued for 30 weeks. At that time point samples were collected and liver histopathological analyses were performed. Results: LTPs decreased the area and number of placental glutathione 5-transferase-positive foci in liver samples of DEN-treated rats. Furthermore, LTPs counteracted DEN-induced fibrosis formation in liver. Immunohistochemical staining of rat liver showed that LTPs inhibited DEN-mediated elevations in numbers of cells positive for PCNA and 8-OHdG. Conclusion: For the first time, the present study demonstrated, that LTPs exert a chemo-preventive effect against precancerous lesions through inhibition of cellular proliferation and DNA damage in a rat liver model.

The shock test was implemented with 155-1731 mg L-1 OTC, lasting for 1 to 3-fold hydraulic retention times, under the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) of 6.72 and 13.4 kg m(-3) d(-1). The response of the process was divided into shock and recovery stage and the performance under the stress was indicated by stability index and granule characteristic. In the shock period, nitrogen removal rate (NRR) was ranged from 12.1 to 12.1-4.04 kg m(-3) d(-1). The specific ANAMMOX activity (SAA) and heme c content, were respectively reduced by 1.4% and 17.6-29.4%. Foremost, the OTC shock was restorable and the recovery lasted for 4-353 h. The robustness of ANAMMOX process was dependent on OTC level, duration of shock and NLR applied. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Meng, YJ; Shao, CG; Wang, HZ; Chen, M				Meng, Yijun; Shao, Chaogang; Wang, Huizhong; Chen, Ming			Uncovering DCL1-dependent small RNA loci on plant genomes: a structure-based approach	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Cluster; Dicer-like 1 (DCL1); high-throughput sequencing; microRNA (miRNA); precursor microRNAs (pre-miRNAs); secondary structure; small RNA (sRNA)	BIOGENESIS; RESOURCES; MICRORNAS; SIRNA	In plants, Dicer-like 1 (DCL1)-mediated two-step cleavages are essential for the processing of microRNA (miRNA) gene products. Interestingly, DCL1 has been indicated to be involved in the production of many small RNAs (sRNAs) that cannot be classified as canonical miRNAs. However, genomic and functional information on the non-miRNA, DCL1-dependent sRNAs is still limited. Here, we propose a secondary structure-based approach for identification of the precursors containing novel DCL1-dependent sRNA loci. To demonstrate the utility of the workflow: first, 5898 DCL1-dependent sRNAs of 2024 nucleotides were identified from the sRNA high-throughput sequencing data sets prepared from rice DCL1 RNA interference transgenic lines. Those perfectly mapped to the rice pre-miRNAs (precursor microRNAs) were removed. The remaining 5795 sRNAs were then mapped onto the rice genome, obtaining 30 902 perfectly matched loci belonging to 2310 sRNAs. A total of 4631 clusters of sRNA loci were defined for secondary structure prediction by using RNAfold. The prediction results generated by two algorithms, namely MFE (minimum free energy) and centroid, were manually compared to identify the conserved long-stem structures containing DCL1-dependent sRNA loci. For the purpose of a case study, a portion of the prediction results was screened manually. As a result, 60 clusters displayed great potential for forming featured long-stem structures for the generation of DCL1-dependent sRNAs. Together, the results indicate that the proposed workflow is applicable for the identification of novel DCL1-dependent sRNA loci on plant genomes.

An X-ray crystal structure analysis of (2-bromophenyl)diphenylphosphane (1a) unambiguously confirmed the constitution of the functionalized phosphane. The hydrosilylation reaction of styrene with triethoxysilane catalyzed with RhCl3/triarylphosphane was studied. In comparison with the classic Wilkinson's catalyst, rhodium complexes with functionalized triarylphosphane ligands are characterized by a very high catalytic effectiveness for the hydrosilylation of alkene. Among these catalysts tested, RhCl3/diphenyl(2-(trimethylsilyl)phenyl)phosphane (8a) exhibited excellent catalytic properties.

They show deep blue fluorescence in both solution and film states, with narrow spectral profiles and excellent solidstate emission efficiencies up to 94%. Due to the presence of the boron atoms, both luminophors possess low-lying LUMO energy levels as revealed by theoretical calculation. They can function as both light emitter and electron transporter in organic light-emitting diodes. A device fabricated from one of the new luminophors radiates deep blue light with a maximum emission at 432 nm (CIE = 0.179, 0.128), and affords a maximum luminance of 10,320 cd m(-2), and a peak efficiency of 3.4 cd A(-1).

In the present study, we demonstrate that Nkx2.2 homeodomain transcription factor is a key regulator for the timing of oligodendrocyte differentiation during development. Whereas induced expression of Nkx2.2 in early oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) causes precocious differentiation of oligodendrocytes, conditional ablation of Nkx2.2 temporally delays oligodendrocyte maturation. Moreover, Nkx2.2 can directly bind to the promoter of platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (Pdgfra) and repress its gene expression. Genetic ablation of Pdgfra mimics the effect of Nkx2.2 overexpression in accelerating OPC differentiation in the developing spinal cord. Together, our findings strongly suggest that Nkx2.2 functions as a major 'switch' to turn off Pdgfra signaling in OPCs and initiate the intrinsic program for oligodendrocyte differentiation.

However, the users are likely to feel inconvenient, or even discard the service. This paper, therefore, addresses this issue and introduces a novel method, referred to as the Quantified riSk and Benefit adaptive Authentication Factors combination (QSBAF). QSBAF balances the requirements for both security and usability in the authentication of an information system and improves the system's ability to respond quickly to emerging risky events. In QSBAF, the authentication factors can be dynamically combined on the basis of quantified risk, benefit measurements, and combination policies. Furthermore, QSBAF provides an adaptive mechanism, which is driven by history data to justify the measurements of risk and benefit. In this paper, we use the online banking system as a typical scenario to demonstrate the usage of QSBAF. We also implement a prototype of QSBAF to evaluate the performance of its feasibility in real application scenarios. Copyright (c) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In order to determine BHLHB5's functional mechanism in retinogenesis, we used the Cre-loxP recombination system to genetically trace the lineage of BHLHB5+ cells in normal and Bhlhb5-null retinas. The Bhlhb5-Cre knock-in allele was used to activate the constitutive expression of a GFP reporter in the Bhlhb5-expressing cells, and the cell fates of Bhlhb5-lineage cells were identified by using specific cell markers and were compared between normal and Bhlhb5-null retinas. Results: In addition to GABAergic amacrine and OFF-CB cells, Bhlhb5 lineage cells give rise to ganglion, glycinergic amacrine, rod bipolar, ON-bipolar, and rod photoreceptor cells during normal retinal development. Targeted deletion of Bhlhb5 resulted in the loss of GABAergic amacrine, glycinergic amacrine, dopaminergic amacrine, and Type 2 OFF-CB cells. Furthermore, in the absence of BHLHB5, a portion of Bhlhb5 lineage cells switch their fate and differentiate into cholinergic amacrine cells. Conclusions: Our data reveal a broad expression pattern of Bhlhb5 throughout retinogenesis and demonstrate the cell-autonomous as well as non-cell-autonomous role of Bhlhb5 in the specification of amacrine and bipolar subtypes.

The HCB and MDB algorithms do not introduce any additional tunable parameters, but keep the simple character of the original HHM. Based on two empirical datasets, the Netflix and MovieLens, the HCB and MDB are found to show better recommendation accuracy for both the overall objects and the cold objects than the HHM algorithm. Our work suggests that properly eliminating the high-order redundant correlations can provide a simple and effective approach to accurate recommendation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The features of ring opening polymerization reactions have been investigated in detail. The preferable conditions for the ring opening polymerization of D4 are as follows: [Nd3+] = 0.07 mol L-1 and [SO42-] = 1.85 mol L-1 in the immersing solution; the amount of SO42-/TiO2/Nd3+ calcined at 500 degrees C was 5 wt% of the amount of D4; polymerization at 80 degrees C for 1 h. The average molecular weights of the products obtained using various rare earth catalysts were in order Nd > La > Sm > Gd, which shows that the light rare earths were more favorable for higher molecular weight products than the heavy ones. According to the polymerization features, a cationic equilibrium reaction mechanism is proposed.

It proposes a novel editable text method to represent the multidimensional tree-like information structure of the Kunqu libretto literature and a musical semantic annotation method based on numbered musical notation to accommodate the musical features of Kunqu librettos. To maintain the characteristics of the original Kunqu musical notation, it proposes a method to reconstruct Kunqu libretto on the Web based on scalable vector graphics. Some Kunqu librettos were randomly selected for experiments, and the results demonstrated that the editable text method and the musical semantic annotation method were able to fully represent the effective information of the Kunqu libretto literature and that the method to reconstruct librettos on theWeb was able to reflect the writing characteristics of the musical notation in the original librettos. Finally, it discusses the primary future research directions related to digital Kunqu, including Kunqu libretto metadata research, corpus construction for the librettos and Qupai (the unique ancient Chinese tune mode), libretto music information disambiguation research, libretto image segmentation and pattern recognition, digital Kunqu roles, digital Kunqu stages, digital Kunqu costume suitcases, virtual Kunqu, digitization and restoration of Kunqu cultural relics, and Kunqu's application prospects in conventional media such as animation, anime, and movies.

In this report, we discovered that endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress transiently activates the catalytic components of telomerase (TERT) expression in human cancer cell lines and murine primary neural cells. Importantly, we show that depletion of hTERT sensitizes cells to undergo apoptosis under ER stress, whereas increased hTERT expression reduces ER stress-induced cell death independent of catalytically active enzyme or DNA damage signaling. Our findings establish a functional link between ER stress and telomerase, both of which have important implications in the pathologies associated with aging and cancer.

In this work, B N coordination is grafted onto two tetraphenylethene (TPE)-based luminogens and the thermal stabilities, optical properties and electronic structures of the generated organoborons are investigated and compared with those of counterparts without B N coordination. Both luminogens are thermally stable and show aggregation-induced emission. The presence of B N coordination not only improves photoluminescent property of the luminogens, affording excellent solid-state fluorescence quantum yields up to unity, but also lowers the LUMO energy levels, owing to p(pi)-pi* conjugation. The application of both organoborons as emitters for organic light-emitting diodes is evaluated. The devices of them exhibit superior electroluminescent efficiencies to the devices of counterparts, demonstrating that B N coordination is conducive to electroluminescent property of the luminogens.

Nanotechnology provides the opportunity for the development of new antibacterial agents. Nano-inorganic metal oxides have shown the potential to reduce bacterial contamination of foods. When the particle size of materials decreases from the micrometre to the nanometre range, nano-functional properties such as diffusivity, mechanical strength, chemical reactivity and biological properties are improved. Significantly, ZnO has been used in many applications with particular success. Many studies have shown that ZnO nanoparticles have enhanced antibacterial activity. This review discusses the main synthetic methods, antibacterial activity, antibacterial mechanisms and food applications of ZnO nanoparticles.

However, the long-term effect of Thi on Chang conjunctival cells is not clear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to further investigate the fate of the cells after acute exposure to Thi. Cells were first exposed to various concentrations of Thi (0.00001 % similar to aEuro parts per thousand 0.001 %) for 30 min, and then cells were assessed after a 24-h recovery period. Morphologic changes were observed under a light microscope and cell viability was evaluated. Cell apoptosis, cell cycle distribution and mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) (rhodamine 123 assay) were detected by flow cytometry analysis. Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP), activation of caspase-3 and microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC-3) were examined by western blot analysis. DNA strand breaks were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with 30 min exposure to Thi, although no significant cell death was detected. However, after 24-h recovery, the ratio of apoptotic cells was significantly increased to 0.0005 % and 0.001 % in Thi treated groups (p < 0.001 compared to the control group). Apoptosis was confirmed by the cleavage of PARP and caspase-3 activation. In addition, G2/M cell cycle arrest and decrease of MMP were recorded. Finally, the LC-3 results indicated the occurrence of autophagy in Thi-treated cells. Acute exposure to Thi can induce DNA damage, and eventually can lead to cell death, probably through the caspase-dependent apoptosis pathway, while autophagy might also be involved.

It aims to segment an image by leveraging its image-level semantics (i.e., tags). This paper presents a weakly-supervised image segmentation algorithm that learns the distribution of spatially structural superpixel sets from image-level labels. More specifically, we first extract graphlets from a given image, which are small-sized graphs consisting of superpixels and encapsulating their spatial structure. Then, an efficient manifold embedding algorithm is proposed to transfer labels from training images into graphlets. It is further observed that there are numerous redundant graphlets that are not discriminative to semantic categories, which are abandoned by a graphlet selection scheme as they make no contribution to the subsequent segmentation. Thereafter, we use a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to learn the distribution of the selected post-embedding graphlets (i.e., vectors output from the graphlet embedding). Finally, we propose an image segmentation algorithm, termed representative graphlet cut, which leverages the learned GMM prior to measure the structure homogeneity of a test image. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art weakly-supervised image segmentation methods, on five popular segmentation data sets. Besides, our approach performs competitively to the fully-supervised segmentation models.

In addition, HDL has potent anti-inflammatory properties that may be critical for protection against other inflammatory diseases. The molecular mechanisms of how HDL can modulate inflammation, particularly in immune cells such as macrophages, remain poorly understood. Here we identify the transcriptional regulator ATF3, as an HDL-inducible target gene in macrophages that downregulates the expression of Toll-like receptor (TLR)-induced proinflammatory cytokines. The protective effects of HDL against TLR-induced inflammation were fully dependent on ATF3 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings may explain the broad anti-inflammatory and metabolic actions of HDL and provide the basis for predicting the success of new HDL-based therapies.

Materials and Methods: Systematic literature search of Cochrane Controlled Trials Register Databases, Medline, Embase, ISI databases, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database was performed. Statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan software. Results: Thirty-two recent studies including 6526 patients in total were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with SG, RYGB had significantly better effect in resolving type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and arthritis. However, RYGB had higher incidence of complications and reoperation, and longer operation time than SG. Conclusions: RYGB was more effective than SG in the resolution of obesity-related comorbidities, SG was a safer procedure with a reduced rate of complications and reoperation.

The method is developed on two color harmony principles of familial factors and rhythmic spans from conventional color theories. The interactive tool makes use of these principles for users to interactively generate colors palettes containing harmonious combinations in the hue, saturation, and lightness color space in as few steps as possible.

J	Zhou, JZ; Ding, DQ; Wang, M; Cong, YS				Zhou, Junzhi; Ding, Deqiang; Wang, Miao; Cong, Yu-Sheng			Telomerase reverse transcriptase in the regulation of gene expression	BMB REPORTS			English	Review						Gene expression; Telomerase; TERT	HUMAN FIBROBLASTS; CELLS; RNA; CATENIN; DNA; ACTIVATION; LENGTH; HTERT; STAT3	Telomerase plays a pivotal role in the pathology of aging and cancer by maintaining genome integrity, controlling cell proliferation, and regulating tissue homeostasis. Telomerase is essentially composed of an RNA component, Telomerase RNA or TERC, which serves as a template for telomeric DNA synthesis, and a catalytic subunit, telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT). The canonical function of TERT is the synthesis of telomeric DNA repeats, and the maintenance of telomere length. However, accumulating evidence indicates that TERT may also have some fundamental functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity. Among these telomere-independent activities of hTERT, the role of hTERT in gene transcription has been investigated in detail. Transcriptional regulation is a fundamental process in biological systems. Several studies have shown a direct involvement of hTERT in gene transcription. This mini-review will focus on the role of hTERT in gene transcription regulation, and discuss its possible mechanisms.

In this Letter, we consider the edge weights to represent such multi-role relations. In addition, we perform detailed analysis of two representative metrics, outbreak threshold and epidemic prevalence, on SIS and SIR models. Both theoretical and simulation results find good agreements with each other. Furthermore, experiments show that, on fully mixed networks, the weight distribution on edges would not affect the epidemic results once the average weight of whole network is fixed. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of epidemic spreading on multi-relation and weighted networks. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Incorporation of CRGO into PS polymer is found to significantly improve the creep resistance and recovery properties. The results are compared with the creep and recovery of the corresponding composites with carbon black (CB) and carbon nanotube (CNT) nano-additives, and it is observed that both the CB/PS and CNT/PS systems present worse efficiencies in reducing the creep and unrecovered response. The CRGO sheets with corrugated structures possess higher specific surface area and display better dispersion in the PS matrix compared to the CB or CNT nano-additives, which should produce strong sheet/matrix interfacial interaction to restrict the mobility of polymer chains. The formation mechanisms are further interpreted based on the analysis from the dynamic mechanical properties and thermo-gravimetric results. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dryland ecosystems are characterized by low amounts of unpredictable precipitation as well as by often having biological soil crusts (BSCs) on the soil surface. In dryland plant communities, plants interact mostly as they compete for water resources, and the direction and intensity of plant interaction varies as a function of the temporal fluctuation in water availability. Since BSCs influence water redistribution to some extent, a greenhouse experiment was conducted to test the hypothesis that the intensity and direction of plant interactions in a dryland plant community can be modified by BSCs. In the experiment, 14 combinations of four plant species (Artemisia ordosica, Artemisia sphaerocephala, Chloris virgata and Setaria viridis) were subjected to three levels of coverage of BSCs and three levels of water supply. The results show that: 1) BSCs affected plant interaction intensity for the four plant species: a 100% coverage of BSCs significantly reduced the intensity of competition between neighboring plants, while it was highest with a 50% coverage of BSCs in combination with the target species of A. sphaerocephala and C. virgata; 2) effects of the coverage of BSCs on plant interactions were modified by water regime when the target species were C. virgata and S. viridis; 3) plant interactions were species-specific. In conclusion, the percent coverage of BSCs affected plant interactions, and the effects were species-specific and could be modified by water regimes. Further studies should focus on effects of the coverage of BSCs on plant-soil hydrological processes.

Among various types of entangled states, the NOON states are a kind of special quantum entangled states with two orthogonal component states in maximal superposition, which have a wide range of potential applications in quantum communication and quantum information processing. Here, we propose a fast and simple scheme for generating NOON states of photons in two superconducting resonators by using a single superconducting transmon qutrit. Because only one superconducting qutrit and two resonators are used, the experimental setup for this scheme is much simplified when compared with the previous proposals requiring a setup of two superconducting qutrits and three cavities. In addition, this scheme is easier and faster to implement than the previous proposals, which require using a complex microwave pulse, or a small pulse Rabi frequency in order to avoid nonresonant transitions.

The optimal pretreatment parameters were determined by investigating the effects of the contents of silica sol and the protective colloid, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), the viscosity of the latex, and solid content of the latex on the redispersibility, moisture content, and residual ratio of RPP particles. The optimal spray-drying parameters were established by investigating the effects of the drying temperature and atomizing speed on the moisture content, residual ratio, redispersibility, and film-forming ability of RPP particles. The dynamic mass- and energy-control equations were combined to establish a model of spray-drying RPP particles. The changes in the temperature and moisture content of the RPP droplets were predicted by coupling the two equations and running a code developed in MATLAB.

The left dominance of these two areas was the earliest observation of brain asymmetry. It was demonstrated that the language network and its functional asymmetry during resting state were reproducible across institutions. However, the temporal reliability of resting-state language network and its functional asymmetry are still short of knowledge. In this study, we established a seed-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis of language network with seed regions located at Broca's and Wernicke's areas, and investigated temporal reliability of language network and its functional asymmetry. The language network was found to be temporally reliable in both short-and long-term. In the aspect of functional asymmetry, the Broca's area was found to be left lateralized, while the Wernicke's area is mainly right lateralized. Functional asymmetry of these two areas revealed high short-and long-term reliability as well. In addition, the impact of global signal regression (GSR) on reliability of the resting-state language network was investigated, and our results demonstrated that GSR had negligible effect on the temporal reliability of the resting-state language network. Our study provided methodology basis for future cross-culture and clinical researches of resting-state language network and suggested priority of adopting seed-based functional connectivity for its high reliability.

SCC elements in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are highly diverse and there is evidence suggesting that they serve as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). However, only a small number of SCC elements have been characterized in CoNS and their exact roles in the emergence and evolution of MRSA remain to be demonstrated. Here, we determined the structure of an SCC composite island (CISH32) found in the clinical Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolate SH32 by whole-genome DNA sequencing. CISH32 was 48 kb in length and mainly composed of two imperfect SCC elements, namely (i) a Psi SCCmec(SH32) part containing a class C1 mec gene complex but lacking ccr genes and (ii) a SCCSH32 part with a ccrA5B3 gene complex but lacking mec genes. In addition, CISH32 contained a type III restriction-modification system and several resistance loci, for example genes conferring resistance to cadmium and arsenic. Psi SCCmec(SH32) is almost entirely identical to a pseudo SCCmec element found in S. haemolyticus WCH1 and shares pronounced sequence similarity to a Psi SCCmec element of S. haemolyticus JCSC1435. However, staphylococci other than S. haemolyticus, including S. aureus and S. epidermidis, contain homologs of SCCSH32 that are more similar to SCCSH32 than those elements found in S. haemolyticus, suggesting that CISH32 of S. haemolyticus SH32 was assembled in recent evolutionary events. Moreover, the composite structure of CISH32 indicates that the detection of class C1 mec and ccrA5B3 gene complexes in S. haemolyticus does not always indicate the existence of a UT9-type SCCmec element, which has remained questionable.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							HOME LITERACY ENVIRONMENT; EMERGENT LITERACY; CHINESE; INTERVENTION; METAANALYSIS	Parents and teachers worldwide believe that a visual environment rich with print can contribute to young children's literacy. Children seem to recognize words in familiar logos at an early age. However, most of previous studies were carried out with alphabetic scripts. Alphabetic letters regularly correspond to phonological segments in a word and provide strong cues about the identity of the whole word. Thus it was not clear whether children can learn to read words by extracting visual word form information from environmental prints. To exclude the phonological-cue confound, this study tested children's knowledge of Chinese words embedded in familiar logos. The four environmental logos were employed and transformed into four versions with the contextual cues (i.e., something apart from the presentation of the words themselves in logo format like the color, logo and font type cues) gradually minimized. Children aged from 3 to 5 were tested. We observed that children of different ages all performed better when words were presented in highly familiar logos compared to when they were presented in a plain fashion, devoid of context. This advantage for familiar logos was also present when the contextual information was only partial. However, the role of various cues in learning words changed with age. The color and logo cues had a larger effect in 3- and 4-year-olds than in 5-year-olds, while the font type cue played a greater role in 5-year-olds than in the other two groups. Our findings demonstrated that young children did not easily learn words by extracting their visual form information even from familiar environmental prints. However, children aged 5 begin to pay more attention to the visual form information of words in highly familiar logos than those aged 3 and 4.

The dyes were characterized by X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy and their photophysical properties were investigated and analyzed by carrying out a series of theoretical calculations. The absorption spectra contain markedly redshifted absorbance bands due to conjugation between the styryl moieties and the main BODIPY fluorophore. Very low fluorescence quantum yields and significant Stokes shifts are observed for 2,6-distyryl-substituted BODIPYs, relative to analogous 3,5-distyryl- and 1,7-distyryl-substituted BODIPYs. Although the fluorescence of the compound with -position styryl substituents on both pyrrole moieties and one with both - and -position substituents was completely quenched, the compound with only -position substituents exhibits weak emission in polar solvents, but moderately intense emission with a quantum yield of 0.49 in hexane. Protonation studies have demonstrated that these 2,6-p-dimethylaminostyrene isomers can be used as sensors for changes in pH. Theoretical calculations provide strong evidence that styryl rotation and the formation of non-emissive charge-separated S-1 states play a pivotal role in shaping the fluorescence properties of these dyes. Molecular orbital theory is used as a conceptual framework to describe the electronic structures of the BODIPY core and an analysis of the angular nodal patterns provides a reasonable explanation for why the introduction of substituents at different positions on the BODIPY core has markedly differing effects.

However, as the framework for ocean colour remote sensing is based on the radiation intensity at the top-of-atmosphere (TOA), the polarisation of the radiation, which contains additional information on atmospheric and water optical properties, has largely been neglected. In this study, we propose a new simple concept to ocean colour remote sensing that uses parallel polarisation radiance (PPR) instead of the traditional radiation intensity. Weuse vector radiative transfer simulation and polarimetric satellite sensing data to demonstrate that using PPR has two significant advantages in that it effectively diminishes the sun glint contamination and enhances the ocean colour signal at the TOA. This concept may open new doors for ocean colour remote sensing. We suggest that the next generation of ocean colour sensors should measure PPR to enhance observational capability.

Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) is a recently developed reverse genetic approach that facilities an easier and more rapid study of gene functions. In this study, the PEAM4 gene was effectively silenced by VIGS using a pea early browning virus (PEBV) in wild type pea JI992. The infected plants showed abnormal phenotypes, as the floral organs, especially the sepals and petals changed in both size and shape, which made the corolla less closed. The petals changed in morphology and internal symmetry with, the stamens reduced and carpel dehisced. Larger sepals and longer tendrils with small cauline leaves appeared, with some sepals turning into bracts, and secondary inflorescences with fused floral organs were formed, indicating a flower-to-inflorescence change. The infected plants also displayed a delayed and prolonged flowering time. The PEAM4-VIGS plants with altered floral morphology were similar to the pim (proliferating inflorescence meristem) mutant and also mimicked the phenotypes of ap1 mutants in Arabidopsis. The expression pattern of the homologous genes PsSOC1a and PsSVP, which were involved in flowering time and florescence morphological control downstream of PEAM4, were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR and mRNA in situ hybridization. PsSOC1a and PsSVP were ectopically expressed and enhanced in the floral meristems from PEAM4-silenced plants. Our data suggests that PEAM4 may have a similar molecular mechanism as AtAP1, which inhibits the expression of PsSOC1a and PsSVP in the floral meristem from the early stages of flower development. As such, in this way PEAM4 plays a crucial role in maintaining floral organ identity and flower development in pea. (C) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Both of the families contain a similar carboxyl-terminal domain (Domain III/IV) that facilitates interactions between these two families. In spite of the importance of protein-protein interactions among these transcription factors, the mechanisms involved in these interactions are largely unknown. In this study, we isolated six intragenic suppressors of an auxin insensitive mutant, Osiaa23. Among these suppressors, Osiaa23-R5 successfully rescued all the defects of the mutant. Sequence analysis revealed that an amino acid substitution occurred in the Tryptophan (W) residue in Domain IV of Osiaa23. Yeast two-hybrid experiments showed that the mutation in Domain IV prevents the protein-protein interactions between Osiaa23 and OsARFs. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the W residue is conserved in both OsIAAs and OsARFs. Next, we performed site-specific amino acid substitutions within Domain IV of OsARFs, and the conserved W in Domain IV was exchanged by Serine (S). The mutated OsARF(WS)s can be released from the inhibition of Osiaa23 and maintain the transcriptional activities. Expression of OsARF(WS) s in Osiaa23 mutant rescued different defects of the mutant. Our results suggest a previously unknown importance of Domain IV in both families and provide an indirect way to investigate functions of OsARFs.

Methodological considerations for combining functional with biochemical imaging	JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE METHODS			English	Article						Imaging; Multimodal; fMRI; MRS; EEG; PET; Brain; Human; Methodology; Experimental design	ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GABA CONCENTRATION; GLUTAMATE; DEPRESSION; RESPONSES; STIMULATION; AMPLITUDE; PET	There is an increasing interest in combining different imaging modalities to investigate the relationship between neural and biochemical activity. More specifically, imaging techniques like MRS and PET that allow for biochemical measurement are combined with techniques like fMRI and EEG that measure neural activity in different states. Such combination of neural and biochemical measures raises not only technical issues, such as merging the different data sets, but also several methodological issues. These methodological issues - ranging from hypothesis generation and hypothesis-guided use of technical facilities to target measures and experimental measures - are the focus of this paper. We discuss the various methodological problems and issues raised by the combination of different imaging methodologies in order to investigate neuro-biochemical relationships on a regional level in humans. For example, the choice of transmitter and scan type is discussed, along with approaches to allow the establishment of particular specificities (such as regional or biochemical) to in turn make results fully interpretable. An algorithm that can be used as a form of checklist for designing such multimodal studies is presented. The paper concludes that while several methodological and technical caveats needs to be overcome and addressed, multimodal imaging of the neuro-biochemical relationship provides an important tool to better understand the physiological mechanisms of the human brain.

This EEG-fMRI study aims to comprehensively assess the alterations of ICNs affected by generalized spike-and-wave discharge (GSWD) during absence seizure (AS). Twelve fMRI sessions with GSWD, and individually paired non-GSWD sessions were acquired from 16 patients with AS. Ten ICNs corresponding to seizure origination and cognitive processes were extracted using independent component analysis. Intra- and inter-network connectivity alterations of the ICNs were observed through comparisons between GSWD and non-GSWD sessions. Sequential correlation analysis between GSWD and the ICN time courses addressed the immediate effects of GSWD on ICNs during AS. GSWD-related increase of intra-network connectivity was found only in the thalamus, and extensive decreases were found in the ICNs corresponding to higher-order cognitive processes including the default-mode network, dorsal attention network, central executive network and salience network. The perceptive networks and motor network were less affected by GSWD. Sequential correlation analysis further demonstrated different responses of the ICNs to GSWD. In addition to GSWD-related functional excitation in the thalamus and functional suspension in the default-mode network, this study revealed extensive inhibitions in the other ICNs corresponding to higher-order cognitive processes, and spared perceptive and motor processes in AS. GSWD elevated synchronization of brain network activity and sequentially affected the ICNs. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this paper, combining the evolutionary games with information spreading, we propose a lattice model to investigate dynamics of human innovative behaviors based on benefit-driven assumption. Simulations show several properties in agreement with peoples' daily cognition on innovative behaviors, such as slow diffusion of innovative behaviors, gathering of innovative strategy on "innovative centers", and quasi-localized dynamics. Furthermore, our model also emerges rich non-Poisson properties in the temporal-spatial patterns of the innovative status, including the scaling law in the interval time of innovation releases and the bimodal distributions on the spreading range of innovations, which would be universal in human innovative behaviors. Our model provides a basic framework on the study of the issues relevant to the evolution of human innovative behaviors and the promotion measurement of innovative activities. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a Charged (D(D)over-bar*)(+/-) Mass Peak in e(+)e(-) -> pi D(D)over-bar* at root s=4.26 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							ANNIHILATION; CHARMONIUM; STATE	We report on a study of the process e(+)e(-) -> pi(+/-) (D (D) over bar*)(-/+) at root s = 4.26 GeV using a 525 pb(-1) data sample collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. A distinct charged structure is observed in the (D (D) over bar*)(-/+) invariant mass distribution. When fitted to a mass- dependent- width Breit- Wigner line shape, the pole mass and width are determined to be M-pole (3883: 9 +/- 1.5 (stat) +/- 4.2 dsyst__ MeV= c(2) and Gamma(pole) = (24: 8 +/- 3.3 (stat) +/- 11: 0 (syst)) MeV. The mass and width of the structure, which we refer to as Z(c)(3885), are 2 sigma and 1 sigma, respectively, below those of the Z(c)(3900) -> pi(+/-) J/psi peak observed by BESIII and Belle in pi(+)pi(-) J/psi final states produced at the same center- of- mass energy. The angular distribution of the pi Z(c)(3885) system favors a J(P) = J(P) = 1(+) quantum number assignment for the structure and disfavors 1(-) or 0(-). The Born cross section times the (D (D) over bar*) branching fraction of the Z(c)(3885) is measured to be sigma(e(+)e(-) -> pi(+/-)Z(c)(3885)(-/+)) x B(Z(c)(3885)-/+ -> (D (D) over bar*)(-/+) = (83.5 +/- 6.6 (stat) +/- 22.0 (syst)) pb. Assuming the Z(c)(3885) -> (D (D) over bar*)(-/+) signal reported here and the Z(c)(3900) -> pi J/psi signal are from the same source, the partial width ratio (Gamma(Z(c)(3885) -> D (D) over bar*)/Gamma(Z(c)(3900) -> pi J/psi)) = 6.2 +/- 1.1 (stat) +/- 2.7 (syst) is determined.

However, the potential harmful effects of MWCNT remain unclear and contradictory. To clarify the potentially toxic effects of MWCNT and to elucidate the associated underlying mechanisms, the effects of MWCNT on human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells were examined at both the cellular and the protein level. Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity were examined, followed by a proteomic analysis (2-DE coupled with LC-MS/MS) of the cellular response to MWCNT. Our results demonstrate that MWCNT induces cytotoxicity in A549 cells only at relatively high concentrations and longer exposure time. Within a relatively low dosage range (30 mg/ml) and short time period (24 h), MWCNT treatment does not induce significant cytotoxicity, cell cycle changes, apoptosis, or DNA damage. However, at these low doses and times, MWCNT treatment causes significant changes in protein expression. A total of 106 proteins show altered expression at various time points and dosages, and of these, 52 proteins were further identified by MS. Identified proteins are involved in several cellular processes including proliferation, stress, and cellular skeleton organization. In particular, MWCNT treatment causes increases in actin expression. This increase has the potential to contribute to increased migration capacity and may be mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS).

However, regional activity synchrony has not been characterized in ALS. The purpose of this study was to assess regional brain synchrony by calculating regional data coherence of resting state functional MRI (rsfMRI), as well as its correlations to clinical indices. Twelve ALS patients and 12 age- and sex-matched healthy controls underwent rsfMRI scans. Coherence measurement was performed in the sensory-motor network (SMN), a key brain network impaired by ALS. Decreased coherence was found in the superior medial SMN, which was surrounded by increased coherence in the peripheral SMN areas. Decreased regional coherence in the right postcentral gyrus/precentral gyrus/superior frontal gyrus was correlated with high disease severity as indicated by lower ALSFRS-r scores; meanwhile, enhanced regional coherence in left postcentral gyrus and inferior parietal cortex was related to longer disease duration. Finally, increased coherence in left postcentral gyrus corresponds to fat disease progression rate. These ALS-related SMN regional coherence alterations suggest using regional coherence as a potential marker for studying ALS and its progression. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

It appears in the processes like choosing a mate between men and women, making contracts between job hunters and recruiters, and trading between buyers and sellers. In this paper, we propose a model of two-way selection system, and present its analytical solution for the expectation of successful matching total and the regular pattern that the matching rate trends toward an inverse proportion to either the ratio between the two sides or the ratio of the state total to the smaller group's people number. The proposed model is verified by empirical data of the matchmaking fairs. Results indicate that the model well predicts this typical real-world two-way selection behavior to the bounded error extent, thus it is helpful for understanding the dynamics mechanism of the real-world two-way selection system.

J	Wang, XW; Han, XP; Wang, BH				Wang, Xiang-Wen; Han, Xiao-Pu; Wang, Bing-Hong			Correlations and Scaling Laws in Human Mobility	PLOS ONE			English	Article							MODEL	Background: In recent years, several path-breaking findings on human mobility patterns point out a novel issue which is of important theoretical significance and great application prospects. The empirical analysis of the data which can reflect the real-world human mobility provides the basic cognition and verification of the theoretical models and predictive results on human mobility. One of the most noticeable findings in previous studies on human mobility is the wide-spread scaling anomalies, e. g. the power-law-like displacement distributions. Understanding the origin of these scaling anomalies is of central importance to this issue and therefore is the focus of our discussion. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this paper, we empirically analyze the real-world human movements which are based on GPS records, and observe rich scaling properties in the temporal-spatial patterns as well as an abnormal transition in the speed-displacement patterns together with an evidence to the real-world traffic jams. In addition, we notice that the displacements at the population level show a significant positive correlation, indicating a cascading-like nature in human movements. Furthermore, our analysis at the individual level finds that the displacement distributions of users with stronger correlations usually are closer to the power law, suggesting a correlation between the positive correlation of the displacement series and the form of an individual's displacement distribution. Conclusions/Significance: These empirical findings make connections between the two basic properties of human mobility, the scaling anomalies on displacement distributions and the positive correlations on displacement series, implying the cascading-like dynamics which is exhibited by the positive correlations would cause the emergence of scaling properties on human mobility patterns. Our findings would inspire further researches on mechanisms and predictions of human mobility.

Here, we examine the capacity of these two reprogramming approaches to rejuvenate telomeres using late-generation telomerase- deficient (Terc(-/-)) mice that exhibit telomere dysfunction and premature aging. We found that embryonic stem cells established from Terc(-/-) SCNT embryos (Terc(-/-) ntESCs) have greater differentiation potential and self-renewal capacity than Terc(-/-) iPSCs. Remarkably, SCNT results in extensive telomere lengthening in cloned embryos and improved telomere capping function in the established Terc(-/-) ntESCs. In addition, mitochondrial function is severely impaired in Terc(-/-) iPSCs and their differentiated derivatives but significantly improved in Terc(-/-) ntESCs. Thus, our results suggest that SCNT-mediated reprogramming mitigates telomere dysfunction and mitochondrial defects to a greater extent than iPSC-based reprogramming. Understanding the basis of this differential could help optimize reprogramming strategies.

First, a theoretical mathematical model to calculate intertextual lexical repetition rates is established. Then based on the experimental set, the standard deviations for the repetition rates of all text pairs and the 95% confidence intervals for the estimated values of repetition rates for all text pairs are calculated. After the test of the model and its 95% confidence intervals against all the observed intertextual lexical repetition rates in the test set, it is found that the theoretical model and its 95% confidence intervals experience a very small margin of error, and the model can be used to estimate the intertextual lexical repetition rates and their possible range of variation for authentic English texts of different lengths. The significance of this research is that it can be applied in English teaching, learning and English textbook compilation.

In this article, we reported the determination of chiral primary amine-based multicatalyst systems for enantioselective fluorination of -ketoester. Studies on the enantioselective organocatalytic fluorination promoted by cinchona alkaloid-derived chiral primary amines in the absence of various co catalysts revealed that the combined metal salts and organocatalysts resulted in poor conversion and enantioselectivities, whereas the combinational use of L-leucine and QN-NH2 as dual primary amine catalysts led to the determination of a novel dual organocatalyst with promising catalytic activity. On the basis of these results, we revealed that the steric environment of the chiral enamine intermediate formed by the condensation of -ketoester with the chiral primary amine is most responsible for the observed enantioselectivity.

Phytochemicals, particularly those from herbal medicines, have the potential to affect diseases such as cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure, etc., showing great advantages in disease prevention and personalized treatment. In the past decade, phytochemical metabolism played a major role in the discovery of valuable leading compounds of new drugs. However, the metabolic studies of phytochemical compounds are extremely challenging due to numerous analogs with similar structures, complex endogenous matrices with multi-components in biofluids and cell or tissue extracts. For the feasibility of monitoring phytochemical metabolism, suitable bioanalytical tools and strategies have to be developed and validated. Here we critically review the literature from 2009 to 2014, and present generalized strategy for phytochemical metabolism in biological matrices, including the methodology of metabolism, sample preparation methods and detection techniques. In addition, the present paper covers the diverse aspects of metabolism studies on phenolic acids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, alkaloids, terpenoids, coumarins, lignans and steroids in medicinal plants. Finally, prospects for further research are also considered.

In addition, functional neuroimaging paradigms are now available to help assess consciousness levels in this challenging patient population. The success of these neuroimaging approaches as diagnostic markers is, however, intrinsically linked to understanding the relationships between consciousness and the brain. In this context, a combined theoretical approach to neuroimaging studies is needed. The promise of such theoretically based markers is illustrated by recent findings that used a perturbational approach to assess the levels of consciousness. Further research on the contents of consciousness in DOC is also needed.

Automated trust negotiation (ATN) is an approach that establishes mutual trust between strangers wishing to share resources or conduct business by gradually requesting and disclosing credentials. According to the weaknesses of conventional ATN models, which are based on the resource unlocking strategy of ordinary tree, this paper puts forward an improved coloured timed Petri net-based ATN model and the concept of optimum certificate set, which could serve simultaneous requests of multiple target resources. Along with synchronised negotiation for finding the optimum certificate set, the negotiation effeciency is substantially improved. Moreover, this model added periodic time constraint mechanism of resource, and increased security ensurance factors for the resource sharing in cross-domain calculation.

Mulberry fruit extracts (ME) have demonstrated the antioxidant activity and neuroprotection. The study was to investigate the neuroprotective efficacy of ME against beta-amyloid 25-35-(A beta(25-35)-) induced PC12 cells injury. Cells preincubated with or without ME (200 mu g/mL) for 24 h were treated with A beta(25-35) (20 mu mol/L) for another 24 h. Cell viability was assessed by MTT, gene expression profiles were examined by cDNA microarrays, and RT-PCR were used to confirm the results of microarray assays. ME pretreatment was found to neutralize the cytotoxicity and prevent A beta(25-35)-induced cells injury. Analyses of gene expression profile revealed that genes involving cell adhesion, peptidase activity, cytokine activity, ion binding activity, and angiogenesis regulation were significantly modulated by ME pretreatment. Among those genes, Apaf1, Bace2, and Plcb4 were enriched in the "Alzheimer's disease-reference pathway" and downregulated after ME intervention. RT-PCR results showed that ME preincubation could significantly inhibit A beta(25-35) increased mRNA levels of these three genes. Overall, ME pretreatment could substantially alleviate PC12 cells injury and downregulate expression of AD-related genes, such as Apaf1, Bace2, and Plcb4. This study has a great nutrigenomics interest and brings new and important light in the field of AD intervention.

A simple semi-analytical algorithm (SAABS) was developed for estimating a(560) and b(b)(550) in the Bohai Sea from Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) images. Using field measurements, the SAABS model attained root-mean-square (RMS) values of 13.25% and 12.75% for a(560) and b(b)(550), respectively. The SAABS model was also used to retrieve a(560) and b(b)(550) from the MERIS image. The match-up analysis results indicate that the RMS values of a (560) and b(b)(550) retrievals are 18.75% and 17%, respectively. These findings suggested that if the atmospheric correction scheme is available, the SAABS model may be used for the quantitative monitoring of the absorption and backscattering coefficients in the Bohai Sea from the MERIS images.

The fluorescence intensity of the MSA-CdTe QDs could be quenched only in the presence of Ag+, and the relative fluorescence intensity was decreased as a linear function of Ag+ concentration. Moreover, the proposed sensor was free from common interfering metal ions. The MSA-CdTe QDs were 3.0 nm in particle size and the maximum photoluminescence wavelength was 558 nm. Better sensitivity was obtained with 4.5 x 10(-4) mol L-1 MSA-CdTe QDs in 200 mmol L-1 phosphate buffer (pH 9.0) for a reaction time of 30 min. A linear response between the relative fluorescence intensity, and the concentration of Ag+ was obtained over the range 0.4 to 8 mmol L-1, with a relative standard deviation of 3.6% (n = 5) for 1.5 mmol L-1 and a detection limit of 54 nmol L-1. The proposed method was applied for the determination of Ag+ in two fixer samples at the mmol L-1 level. The spike recovery at a spiked level of 15 mmol L-1 varying from 89.4% to 92.3%, and good agreement between the results by the proposed and AAS methods proved the accuracy of the proposed method.

However, its performance and applicability in real scenarios are limited because of the lack of image information. In this paper, we propose a constrained matrix decomposition algorithm for image representation which contains parameters associated with the characteristics of image data sets. Particularly, we impose label information as additional hard constraints to the alpha-divergence-NMF unsupervised learning algorithm. The resulted algorithm is derived by using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions as well as the projected gradient and its monotonic local convergence is proved by using auxiliary functions. In addition, we provide a method to select the parameters to our semisupervised matrix decomposition algorithm in the experiment. Compared with the state-of-the-art approaches, our method with the parameters has the best classification accuracy on three image data sets.

Poly(oxymethylene) (POM) crystallizes into large banded spherulites with incorporation of poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) at high temperature. The amorphous PLLA components are simultaneously expelled out from the twisted POM crystal lamellae during the crystallization of the POM components. Therefore, a fully co-continuous phase structure is formed with the interpenetration of POM twisted lamellae and the amorphous PLLA phase. The nanoporous POM materials with high porosity and large specific surface area were successfully obtained after extracting the PLLA phase between the twisted POM lamellae. The 3-D interconnected nanoporous POM films obtained using this strategy could be used in various applications. Moreover, such a strategy should also be applicable to other polymer blend systems and it provides a new route for fabricating nanoporous polymeric materials.

Studies carried out on monolayer graphene nanopores aiming at single-base resolution have recently been extended to multilayer graphene (MLG) films, indicating that MLG nanopores are superior to their monolayer counterparts for DNA sequencing. However, the underlying dynamics and current change in the DNA translocation to thread MLG nanopores remain poorly understood. In this paper, we report a molecular dynamics study of DNA passing through graphene nanopores of different layers. We show that the DNA translocation time could be extended by increasing the graphene layers up to a moderate number (7) under a high electric field and that the current in DNA translocation undergoes a stepwise change upon DNA going through an MLG nanopore. A model is built to account for the relationship between the current change and the unoccupied volume of the MLG nanopore. We demonstrate that the dynamics of DNA translocation depends specifically on the interaction of nucleotides with the graphene sheet. Thus, our study indicates that the resolution of DNA detection could be improved by increasing the number of graphene layers in a certain range and by modifying the surface of the graphene nanopores.

MRI has been increasingly used for this endeavor because of its capability of detecting both structural and functional brain patterns without injecting external contrast agent or radioactive tracers. Recent work has shown sensitivity of hippocampal volume and regional cerebral blood flow for differentiating prodromal AD from normal controls as well as AD. This review provides a summary for the existing literature describing the applications of either or both modalities in early AD studies as well as disease progression assessment. The various findings in the reviewed studies lead to a conclusion of assessing hippocampal volume and arterial spin labeling cerebral blood flow as potential markers for disease detection, and progression monitoring though longitudinal studies are still lacking to fully examine their sensitivity and specificity.

When there are some fully flexible routings in FMS, the existing MIP-based methods are not suitable for testing their liveness. This paper defines a subclass of S*PR nets firstly, namely, OSC-S*PR nets, and concludes that an OSC-S*PR net is live if there exist no non-max-controlled siphons. Accordingly, determining whether or not an OSC-S*PR net is live can also be realized by using standardized mixed integer programming (MIP) tools. Furthermore, the liveness property of S*PR nets can be tested in two steps: first, for a given S*PR net, constructing an OSC-S*PR net to ensure that if the latter is live then the former must be live; second, testing liveness of the constructed OSC-S*PR net by the aforementioned MIP-based algorithm. In the end, the performance of the method is demonstrated by an application of FMS.

Numerical analyses on two real data sets, Epinions and Friendfeed, demonstrate the improvement of recommendation performance by taking social interests into account, and experimental results show that our algorithm can alleviate the user cold-start problem more effectively compared with the mass diffusion and user-based collaborative filtering methods.

J	Xia, YJ; Zhang, T; Wang, SB				Xia, Yingjie; Zhang, Ting; Wang, Shengbao			A Generic Methodological Framework for Cyber-ITS: Using Cyber-infrastructure in ITS Data Analysis Cases	FUNDAMENTA INFORMATICAE			English	Article						Intelligent Transportation Systems; Cyber-infrastructure; Computational Intensity; Framework		This paper presents a method to capture the computational intensity and computing resource requirements of data analysis in intelligent transportation systems (ITS). These requirements can be transformed into a generic methodological framework for Cyber-ITS, mainly consisting of region-based ITS data divisions and tasks scheduling for processing, to support the efficient use of cyber-infrastructure (CI). To characterize the computational intensity of a particular ITS data analysis, the computational transformation is performed by data-centric and operation-centric transformation functions. The application of this framework is illustrated by two ITS data analysis cases: multi-sensor data fusion for traffic state estimation by integrating rough set theory with Dempster-Shafer (D-S) evidence theory, and geospatial computation on Global Positioning System (GPS) data for advertising value evaluation. To make the design of generic parallel computing solutions feasible for ITS data analysis in these cases, an approach is developed to decouple the region-based division from specific high performance computer (HPC) architecture and implement a prototype of the methodological framework. Experimental results show that the prototype implementation of the framework can be applied to divide the ITS data analysis into a load-balanced set of computing tasks, therefore facilitating the parallelized data fusion and geospatial computation to achieve remarkable speedup in computation time and throughput, without loss in accuracy.

Findings from neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies in RE have now demonstrated dysfunction not only in rolandic focus, but also in distant neuronal circuits. Little is known, however, about whether there is distributed abnormal spontaneous brain activity in RE. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI), the present study aimed to determine whether children with RE show abnormal local synchronization during resting state and, if so, whether these changes could be associated with the behavioral/clinical characteristics of RE. Regional homogeneity (ReHo) in children with RE (n = 30) and healthy children (n = 20) was computed on resting-state functional MRI data. In comparison with healthy children, children with RE showed increased ReHo in the central, premotor, and prefrontal regions, while they showed decreased ReHo in bilateral orbitofrontal cortex and temporal pole. In addition, the ReHo value in the left orbitofrontal cortex negatively was corrected with performance intelligence quotient in the children with RE. The aberrant local synchronization, not strictly related to primary site of the typical rolandic focus, indicates the neuropathophysiological mechanism of RE. The study findings may shed new light on the understanding of neural correlation of neuropsychological deficiencies in the children with RE.

However, it is unclear whether Exo1-mediated DNA maintenance pathways play a role in the maintenance of genomic stability and the self-renewal of tissue stem cells in mice with functional telomeres. Here, we analyzed the proliferative capacity of neural stem cells (NSCs) and hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from Exo1(-/-) mice. Our study shows that Exo1 deficiency impairs the maintenance of genomic stability and proliferative capacity in NSCs but not HSCs. In line with these results, we detected a decrease in proliferation and an up-regulation of p21 expression levels in Exo1-deficient NSCs but not Exo1-deficient HSCs. Our data provide experimental evidence that Exo1 deficiency has a differential impact on the homeostasis and proliferative capacity of tissue stem cells in the brain and bone marrow, suggesting that different tissue stem cells utilize distinct mechanisms for maintaining their genomic stability. Our current study provides important insight into the role of Exo1-mediated DNA maintenance pathways in the maintenance of genomic stability and the proliferative capacity of tissue stem cells.

However, the evolutionary functions and origins of cGAS and STING remain largely elusive. Here, we carried out comprehensive evolutionary analyses of the cGAS-STING pathway. Phylogenetic analysis of cGAS and STING families showed that their origins could be traced back to a choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicollis. Modern cGAS and STING may have acquired structural features, including zinc-ribbon domain and critical amino acid residues for DNA binding in cGAS as well as carboxy terminal tail domain for transducing signals in STING, only recently in vertebrates. In invertebrates, cGAS homologs may not act as DNA sensors. Both proteins cooperate extensively, have similar evolutionary characteristics, and thus may have co-evolved during metazoan evolution. cGAS homologs and a prokaryotic dinucleotide cyclase for canonical cGAMP share conserved secondary structures and catalytic residues. Therefore, non-mammalian cGAS may function as a nucleotidyltransferase and could produce cGAMP and other cyclic dinucleotides. Taken together, assembling signaling components of the cGAS-STING pathway onto the eukaryotic evolutionary map illuminates the functions and origins of this innate immune pathway.

The asymmetric Henry reaction of aromatic aldehydes and nitromethane catalyzed by an Ar-BINMOL derived salen-Co(III) complex was achieved with high yields (up to 93%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 98% ee). And more interestingly, it was supposed that either salan-Cu(II) or salen-Co(III) complex catalyzed Henry reaction was an ideal model reaction for providing direct evidence of noncovalent interaction due to the distinguishable ortho-substituted aromatic aldehydes from meta-or parasubstituted benzaldehydes in terms of enantioselectivities and yields.

The reaction of BINOL and cinchona alkaloids was occurred smoothly under the Mitsunobu conditions, which led to the synthesis of a new family of complicated functional molecules based on chiral BINOL and cinchona alkaloids. In addition, on the basis of the experimental results, we provided a possible explanation for the intramolecular tertiary amine-induced retention of configuration at C9 of cinchona alkaloids while the inversion of configuration was observed with general alcohols under classic Mitsunobu conditions.

The response surface methodology (RSM)-guided optimization indicated that the optimal adsorption conditions are: temperature of 35 degrees C, pH of 5.38, and initial Cu(II) concentration of 0.36 mg/mL, and the predicted adsorption capacity from the model reached 328.3 mg/g. At optimum adsorption conditions, the adsorption capacity of Cu(II) was 321.6 mg/g, which obtained from real experiments what were in close agreement with the predicted value. The adsorption isotherms data fitted the Langmuir model well, and the correlation coefficient has been evaluated. The calculation data of thermodynamic parameters (Delta G, Delta S, and Delta H) confirmed that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. The desorption study revealed that Cu(II) can be effectively eluted by 1 mol/l HCl solution, and the recovery was 100%. Moreover, the characterization was undertaken by infrared (IR) spectroscopy.

As revealed by in situ ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy measurements, a much stronger interfacial charge transfer occurs when the pristine graphene is exposed to O-2 plasma prior to the growth of CuPc films, which is attributed to the increased work function of graphene after O-2 plasma treatment. Moreover, the highest occupied molecular orbital leading edge of CuPc locates at similar to 0.80 eV below substrate Fermi level on O-2 plasma treated graphene, whereas it locates at similar to 1.10 eV on pristine graphene. Our findings provide detailed information regarding the electronic structure at CuPc/graphene and CuPc/O-2 plasma treated graphene interfaces. The increased work function in combination with the relatively smaller energy offset between the highest occupied molecular orbital of CuPc and Fermi level of O-2 plasma treated graphene facilitates the extraction of holes at the interface, and hence paves the way for improving the performance of graphene-based organic photovoltaic cells.

Results show that the blocks A in XA(n)B(n) and XB(n)A(n) are adsorbed upon the surface at low temperature, and the adsorption of blocks A takes place roughly at the same temperature. However, the conformational size and instantaneous shape of the blocks A and B in XA(n)B(n) and XB(n)A(n) are different.

Considering the requirements of green analytical chemistry and the Ar ICP-MS instrument, three aqueous mobile phases were employed for the separation of seven iodine species including iodide, iodate and five iodo amino acids (monoiodotyrosine - MIT, di-iodotyrosine - DIT, tri-iodothyronine - T-3, reversed tri-iodothyronine - rT(3), and thyroxine - T-4). The aqueous mobile phases were composed of an ion-pair reagent (tetrabutylammonium hydroxide - TBAH) and an eluent (ammonium chloride, L-phenylalanine or deoxycholic acid) at low concentrations in ultrapure water. Owing to tremendous difference in retention behavior between these iodinated forms, a gradient elution mode was performed for the rapid separation of IO3- and I-, MIT and DIT, and T-3, rT(3) and T-4, respectively. Iodine species separation was achieved with a 12.5 mm C-18 guard column in 7 min. The detection limits for IO3-, I-, MIT, DIT, T-3, rT(3) and T-4 were 0.047, 0.046, 0.057, 0.072, 0.093, 0.094 and 0.081 mu g L-1, respectively. Application of the proposed method was demonstrated by the speciation analysis of iodine in four real urine samples. The developed method offered satisfactory recoveries in the 93-106% range and good repeatability, showing great potential in routine analysis of iodine speciation in environmental, food and biological samples.

TFR (11 similar to 2700mg/ L) evoked dose-dependent vasodilation and hyperpolarization in MCA of both sham and CIR that were partially inhibited by 30 mu M N-nitro-L-arginine-methyl-ester and 10 mu M indomethacin and further attenuated by endogenous H2S synthese-CSE inhibitor PPG (100 mu M) or Ca2+-activated potassium channel (K-ca) inhibitor TEA (1 mM). In whole-cell patch clamp recording, TFR remarkably enhanced the outward current that was inhibited by TEA. CIR increased CSE mRNA expression and the contents of H2S that were further increased by TFR. We conclude that, in MCA of CIR rats, TFR induces non-NO and non-PGI(2)-mediated effects of vasodilatation and hyperpolarization involving K-ca and increases CSE mRNA expression level in endothelial cells and H2S content in the cerebrum. These findings suggest that the response induced by TFR is potentially related to endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor mediated by the endogenous H2S and promote the use of TFR in protection of brain from ischemia-reperfusion injury.

The catalytic reaction proceeded in DMSO-H2O at 100 degrees C and gave a variety of aryl sulfones in high yields. The high water solubility of the ligand enables easy catalyst removal. The scope of the method was validated by a single step synthesis of marketed drug zolimidine, a drug used for peptic ulcers, in 65% yield.

At 25 degrees C, a mixture of vesicles and spheres are observed for the micelles of PS65-b-PNIPAM(108), while PS65-b-PNIPAM(360) exhibits mixed cylindrical and spherical micellar morphology. Upon increasing the temperature, the micellar morphology becomes spherical for PS65-b-PNIPAM(108) at 60 degrees C and for PS65-b-PNIPAM(360) at 40 degrees C. Such vesicle-to-sphere and cylinder-to-sphere transitions of micellar morphology are reversible when the micellar solutions are cooled back to 25 degrees C. However, these temperature-induced morphological transitions of the PS-b-PNIPAM micelles are contrary to the theoretical prediction. Qualitative analysis of the free energy shows that vesicular or cylindrical micelles tend to form at higher temperatures if only the overall volume change of the PNIPAM block is considered. The contradiction between the experimental results and theoretical prediction is interpreted in terms of the local deformability of the PNIPAM chains. At elevated temperatures, the collapsed PNIPAM globules are less deformable and must occupy larger areas at the micellar interface, although the overall volume is smaller at higher temperatures. This will lead to a larger repulsion between the PNIPAM globules and a remarkable increase in the free energy of the corona; thus, the formation of vesicles or cylinders at higher temperatures is prohibited.

Privacy-Preserving Mobile Roaming Authentication with Security Proof in Global Mobility Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS; USER AUTHENTICATION; ANONYMITY; SCHEME; PROTOCOL; EFFICIENT; SERVICE; ENVIRONMENTS	Mobile roaming authentication scheme achieves the mutual authentication and session key establishment between the mobile user and the foreign agent. In 2013, Xie et al. pointed out that Chen et al.'s scheme is vulnerable to offline password attack, and does not achieve fair session key generation, user untraceability, user friendliness, and perfect forward secrecy, and then they proposed an improved scheme. In this paper, we propose an improvement of Xie et al.'s scheme, since the foreign agent may confuse the mobile users when multiple mobile users simultaneously access the foreign agent in Xie et al.'s scheme. Further, we prove the formal security of the proposed scheme, and present the performance comparison between our scheme and some related schemes. The proposed scheme is more efficient and secure than other related schemes and is suitable for using in the global mobility network.

A rat model of asthma was established by sensitization and challenged with ovalbumin (OVA). Airway hyperresponsiveness was detected by direct airway resistance analysis. Lung tissues were examined for cell infiltration and mucus hypersecretion. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was assessed for cytokine levels. In vitro study, Th2 cytokine production was evaluated in the culture supernatant of D10.G4.1 (D10 cells) followed by the determination of cell viability, meanwhile Th2 transcription factor GATA-3 expression in D10 cells was also determined. The oral administration of PF significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) to aerosolized methacholine and decreased IL-4 and IL-13 levels in the BALF. Histological studies showed that PF markedly inhibited inflammatory infiltration and mucus secretion in the lung tissues. In vitro study, psoralen significantly suppressed Th2 cytokines of IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13 by ConA-stimulated D10 cells without inhibitory effect on cell viability. Furthermore, GATA-3 protein expression was also markedly reduced by psoralen. This study demonstrated that PF exhibited inhibitory effects on hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation in a rat model of asthma, which was associated with the suppression of Th2 response. Psoralen, a major constituent of PF, has immunomodulatory properties on Th2 response in vitro, which indicated that psoralen might be a critical component of PF for its therapeutic effects.

Different pre-organized supramolecular coordination complexes with secondary recognition moieties in various directions can be easily obtained by just changing the number or orientation of the coordination sites. Herein, a responsive cross-linked supramolecular polymer network was constructed in an orthogonal way by unifying the themes of coordination-driven self-assembly and cryptand-based molecular recognition. Two stepwise self-assembly behaviors as well as a one-pot interaction for the preparation of this advanced supramolecular polymer were addressed. Notably, cation-induced dynamic properties make the resulting polymer promising candidate for application in degradable materials.

The different reaction conditions were optimized and the products were easily separated from the ReILs which could be reused at least six times without considerable loss in yield. The plausible mechanism of capturing CX2 (O, S) in the ReILs was proposed and it provides a green, efficient protocol to capture CX2 (O, S) in ReILs to synthesize quinazoline derivatives.

Between April 1988 and September 2000, 82 patients with aortic and mitral regurgitation associated with enlarged left ventricle underwent valve replacement at Anzhen Hospital. The valve disease was rheumatic in origin in 75 patients (91.5%) and congenital in 7 (8.5%). Twenty-eight patients were in New York heart Association Functional (NYHA) class II and 39 in class III and 15 in class IV. Echocardiogram showed severe aortic insufficiency associated with mild to moderate mitral regurgitation in 66 patients and severe mitral regurgitation associated with mild to moderate AI in 16 patients. The mean left ventricular diastole diameter (LVDD) was 77.8 +/- 5.2 mm. Valve replacement was performed under hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Early hospital mortality was 7.3%. Two weeks after surgery the echocardiogram showed a reduction of LVDD. Follow up was completed in 69 patients with mean of 13.5 years. 20 patients were in NYHA class I; 26 in Class II and 3 in Class III and 2 in class IV. The follow-up survival rate was 73.9%, and follow-up mortality was 26.1%. LVDD reduced from 77.8 +/- 5.2 mm to 58.3 +/- 4.5 mm (P < 0.001). In 24 patients, the LVDD was less than 50 mm. Double valve replacement and/or repair carried out an acceptable early and Long-term clinical outcomes in patients with MR and AI with associated LV great enlargement. Both LVDD and NYHA improved following surgical treatment in survival patients.

In order to overcome this problem, the authors propose an accurate pedestrian detection system based on two machine learning methods: cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net. During the offline training phase, the parameters of a cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net are trained by standard dataset. These candidates, extracted by the strategy of a multiscale sliding window, are normalized to be standard scale and verified by the cascade AdaBoost detector and random vector functional-link net on the online phase. Only those candidates with high confidence can pass the validation. The proposed system is more accurate than other single machine learning algorithms with fewer false pedestrians, which has been confirmed in simulation experiment on four datasets.

However, the precise role of autophagy in axonal and dendritic degeneration in Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains unclear. In this study, we aim to investigate the precise effect of autophagy in amyloid-beta peptide (A beta)(25-35)-mediated neurite degeneration. A beta(35-25), the non-neurotoxic reverse sequence analogue of A beta(25-35), was used as a negative control. Our results showed that A beta(25-35) dose-dependently suppressed PC12 proliferation and induced autophagy induction in neurites (axons and dendrites). A high proportion of autophagic structures in PC12 neurites were autolysosomes after 24 h of A beta(25-35) treatment. Autophagy inhibition by 3-methyladenine (3MA), LY294002, and chloroquine (CQ) could not relieve the A beta(25-35)-induced neurite degeneration, while administration of autophagy stimulator rapamycin or AR-12 efficiently suppressed neurite degeneration. Autophagosomes colocalized with fragmented mitochondria after A beta(25-35) treatment. Similar results were obtained using in vitro cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons. These findings demonstrate that autophagy stimulation may prevent neuritic degeneration following A beta(25-35) treatment. Upregulation of autophagic activity may provide a valuable approach for the treatment of axonal and dendritic dystrophy in AD patients.

We investigated the effect and possible mechanism of SJP in the human internal mammary artery (IMA, n = 78) taken from patients undergoing coronary surgery. SJP caused full relaxation in KCl- (99.4 +/- 10.5%, n = 6) and U46619- (99.9 +/- 5.6%, n = 6) contracted IMA. Pretreatment of IMA with plasma concentrations of SJP (1 mg/mL), calculated from the plasma concentration of its major component borneol, significantly depressed the maximal contraction to KCl (from 35.8 +/- 6.0 mN to 12.6 +/- 5.6 mN, n = 0.03) and U46619 (from 19.4 +/- 2.9 mN to 5.7 +/- 2.4 mN, P = 0.007) while SJP at 10 mg/mL abolished the subsequent contraction. Endothelium denudation and inhibition of eNOS significantly altered the SJP-induced relaxation without changes of eNOS expression. We conclude that SJP has a potent inhibitory effect on the vasoconstriction mediated by a variety of vasoconstrictors in human arteries. The vasorelaxation involves both endothelium-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Thus, the effect of SJP on human arteries demonstrated in this study may prove to be particularly important in vasorelaxing therapy in cardiovascular disease.

First, by using the technique given in Tsuge (2006), we obtain the uniformly bounded L-infinity estimates z(p(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon) ) <= B(x) and w(p(delta,epsilon),u(delta,epsilon)) <= beta when a(x) is increasing (similarly, w(p(delta,epsilon), u(delta,epsilon)) <= B(x) and z(p(delta,epsilon),u(delta,epsilon)) <= beta when a(x) is decreasing) for the epsilon-viscosity and delta-flux approximation solutions of nonhomogeneous, resonant system without the restriction z(0)(x) <= 0 or w(0) (x) <= 0 as given in Klingenberg and Lu (1997), where z and w are Riemann invariants of nonhomogeneous, resonant system; B(x) > 0 is a uniformly bounded function of x depending only on the function a(x) given in nonhomogeneous, resonant system, and beta is the bound of B(x). Second, we use the compensated compactness theory, Murat (1978) and Tartar (1979), to prove the convergence of the approximation solutions.

Matrix solid phase dispersion was employed to extract pretilachlor from solid sample matrices and eliminate the interference from majority impurity. The field amplified sample injection technique was used to improve the sensitivity. The CE separation, ECL detection and sample pretreatment are investigated in detail. The linear range of 0.1-10 mu mol L-1 with a detection limit (S/N = 3) of 0.02 mu mol L-1 is obtained by CE-ECL with the tris(2,2-bipyridine)-ruthenium( II) (Ru(bpy)(3)(2+)-ECL) system. The developed method is successfully applied for the analysis of pretilachlor residues in rice and soil samples. The average recoveries are in the ranges of 88.7-95.5% for rice, and 92.3-93.3% for soil, respectively. The limits of detection of the proposed method were 0.01 mg kg(-1) in rice matrix, and 0.008 mg kg(-1) in soil matrix, respectively.

Six simulated landfills, that is, three conventional and three recirculated, were employed with different ratios of MSWI BA to MSW. The results depicted that, after 275-day operation, the ratio of MSWI BA to fresh refuse of 1 : 10 (V : V) in the landfill was still not enough to provide sufficient acid-neutralizing capacity for a high organic matter composition of MSW over 45.5% (w/w), while the ratio of MSWI BA to fresh refuse of 1 : 5 (V: V) could act on it. Among the six experimental landfills, leachate quality only was improved in the landfill operated with the BA addition (the ratio of MSWI BA to fresh refuse of 1 : 5 (V: V)) and leachate recirculation.

The relationship between the mechanical, electrical, and optical properties, and the morphology of the composites have also been investigated. The results indicate that high-shear processing can produce stable nanostructured blends and nanodispersed composites with properties impossible for classical blends and composites to achieve. Such a novel and simple strategy could be widely applied to the processing of other composites. The approach developed provides new methods of preparing other materials, which will lead to new applications of already existing materials.

Fillers of identical size are arranged periodically in the system and the Lennard-Jones (LJ) interaction is considered between the polymer and fillers. Our results show that the statistical size and dynamic diffusion properties of the polymer are not only dependent on the size of the polymer relative to the size of fillers and the distance between fillers, but also dependent on the interaction between the polymer and filler. The statistical size of the polymer can increase or decrease. Normal diffusion is always observed for long polymers and small fillers, whereas a transition from a desorbed state to an adsorbed state is observed for short polymers and large fillers. Finally, the size and diffusion of the polymer on an infinitely large surface are studied for comparison.

The effects of reaction parameters of PS-ATD resin (reaction solvent, reaction temperature and the molar ratio of reagents and different times) were monitored to specify the best synthesis conditions. The functional group capacity (the content of the functional group) and the percentage conversion of the functional group of PS-ATD resin prepared under optimum conditions were 3.65 mmol g(-1) and 88.6%, respectively. The structure of PS-ATD resin was characterized by elemental analysis, FTIR, TGA, SEM, and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS). Meanwhile, the adsorption properties of the resin for Pt(IV) were investigated by batch and column experiments. The results suggested that the resin possessed much better adsorption capability for Pt(IV) than for other metal ions and the maximum saturated adsorption capacity was 222.2 mg g(-1) at 308 K, estimated from the Langmuir model. Furthermore, the resin could be regenerated through the desorption of the Pt(IV) anions using the mixture of 1 wt% thiourea and 0.1 M HCl. Finally, the PS-ATD resin could provide a potential application for an efficient process of Pt(IV) recovery from aqueous solutions.

The aim of the present study was to explore the expression and prognostic significance of CENP-A in osteosarcoma. The results of real-time quantitative PCR and Western blotting analysis revealed an enhanced expression of CENP-A in osteosarcomas relative to adjacent non-tumorous bone tissues at both mRNA and protein levels. Immunohistochemically, 72 of the 123 osteosarcoma specimens (58.5%) had high expression of CENP-A. CENP-A overexpression was significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.002), poor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (P=0.016), local recurrence/lung metastasis (P=0.001), high Ki-67 index (P=0.004), and P53 positivity (P=0.005). Median overall and recurrence-free survival time was significantly shorter in patients with high-CENP-A osteosarcomas than in those with low-CENP-A osteosarcomas. Multivariate analysis identified CENP-A as an independent poor prognostic factor for osteosarcoma. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that elevated CENP-A expression is significantly associated with osteosarcoma progression and has an independent prognostic value in predicting overall and recurrence-free survival for patients with osteosarcoma.

However, the problem of quantitative prediction for the ion effect in tertiary structure folding remains. By using the virtual bond RNA folding model (Vfold) to generate RNA conformations and the newly improved tightly bound ion model (TBI) to treat ion-RNA interactions, we investigate Mg2+-facilitated tetraloop-receptor docking. For the specific construct of the tetraloop-receptor system, the theoretical analysis shows that the Mg2+-induced stabilizing force for the docked state is predominantly entropic and the major contribution comes from the entropy of the diffusive ions. Furthermore, our results show that Mg2+ ions promote tetraloop-receptor docking mainly through the entropy of the diffusive ions. The theoretical prediction agrees with experimental analysis.

Films with nanosilvers improve biocorrosion resistance of aluminium in sea water	SURFACE ENGINEERING			English	Article						Aluminium; Nanosilver; EIS; Microbiological; Corrosion	COPPER CORROSION; STAINLESS-STEEL; SILVER; INHIBITION; ADHESION; SILICON; CELLS	The silver nanocrystals encapsulated in mesoporous silica nanoparticles (Ag-MSN) with increased stability and enhanced antibacterial potency were prepared. The morphology of the nanoparticles was characterised by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. X-ray diffraction analyses proved that the silver nanocrystals were truly embedded in the mesoporous silica nanoparticles. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy was carried out to evaluate the effects of organosiloxane films containing Ag-MSN on reducing microbial influenced corrosion. The corrosion resistance property showed that the films containing Ag-MSN could significantly decrease the Vibrio natriegens adhesion and protect the aluminium against biocorrosion in sea water.

In 2012, Li & Lee proposed a user authentication and privacy preserving scheme with smart card for wireless communications. In this paper, we improve the adversary model of this type of authentication scheme, and then demonstrate that Li & Lee's scheme is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack. To remedy this security weakness, an improved scheme is proposed, which is more efficient than Li & Lee's scheme.

ATM-deficient (ATM(-/-)) mice exhibit hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) dysfunction and a high incidence of lymphoma. Gadd45a controls cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA repair, and is involved in the ATM-p53 mediated DNA damage response. However, the role of Gadd45a in regulating the functionality of ATM(-/-) HSCs is unknown. Here we report that Gadd45a deletion did not rescue the defects of T-cells and B-cells development in ATM(-/-) mice. Instead, ATM and Gadd45a double knockout (ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-)) HSCs exhibited an aggravated defect in long-term self-renewal capacity compared to ATM(-/-) HSCs in HSC transplantation experiments. Further experiments revealed that the aggravated defect of ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-) HSCs was due to a reduction of cell proliferation, associated with an accumulation of DNA damage and subsequent activation of DNA damage response including an up-regulation of p53-p21 signaling pathway. Additionally, ATM(-/-) Gadd45a(-/-) mice showed an increased incidence of hematopoietic malignancies, as well as an increased rate of metastasis than ATM(-/-) mice. In conclusion, Gadd45a deletion aggravated the DNA damage accumulation, which subsequently resulted in a further impaired self-renewal capacity and an increased malignant transformation in ATM(-/-) HSCs.

A series of experiments were-conducted in a batch system to assess the effect of the system variables, i.e., initial pH, contact time and temperature. The optimal pH for the adsorption was 5.5 and the maximum adsorption capacity Was 501.4 mg/g at 298 K. The apparent adsorption rate constant were k(288-K) = 2.69 x 10(-5) S-1; k(308 K) = 4.37 x 10(-5) s(-1); k(313 K) = 4.61 x 10(-5) S-1, respectively. The adsorption isotherms data fitted well to Langmuir Model. Finally, Mo(IV) could be eluted by using 1.25 mol/LNaOH solution and the resin can be regenerated and reused without apparent decrease of adsorption capacity.

J	Liu, Y; Song, Y; Song, XD				Liu, Yong; Song, Yu; Song, Xiaodong			An empirical study on the relationship between urban compactness and CO2 efficiency in China	HABITAT INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						Urban compactness; Urban CO2 efficiency; China	FORM; SPECIFICATION; EMISSIONS; SPRAWL; POLICY; TOWNS; CITY	This analyzes the relationship between urban compactness andCO(2) efficiency in China. A quantitative indicator of urban compactness andCO(2) efficiency (CO2 economic efficiency andCO(2) social efficiency) was selected and calculated using remote sensing and panel data analysis. According to data from 30 cities, urban compactness is correlated positively with urbanCO(2) economic efficiency, which is measured by the ratio of GDP to totalCO(2) emissions. Conversely, the compactness ratio shows a negative correlation with urbanCO(2) social efficiency, which is measured by the ratio of social welfare indicators to total CO2 emissions. These results indicate that, within China, designing compact low-carbon cities could lead to an increase in urbanCO(2) economic efficiency. However, if the compactness ratio is too high, the increased compactness accompanied by various socio-environmental problems will result in a decrease in urbanCO(2) social efficiency. Therefore, compactness entails a trade-off and this should be considered by policymakers. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Analysis of the X-ray crystal structures of compounds 7, 8 and 10-12 indicates the existence of pi-pi stacking and H-bond (F-H-C, O-H-N, N-H-C) interactions. These novel boron complexes exhibit large Stokes shifts (3300-8400 cm(-1)) and moderate quantum yields (0.15-0.64). Time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations reveal that the maximum absorption bands for 7-12 are attributed to the HOMO -> LUMO transitions, and that the calculated absorption wavelengths agree well with the experimental trends.

Various messages are spread quickly and widely by retweeting in microblogs. In this paper, we take Sina microblog as an example, aiming to predict the possible number of retweets of an original tweet in one month according to the time series distribution of its top n retweets. In order to address the problem, we propose the concept of a tweet's lifecycle, which is mainly decided by three factors, namely, the response time, the importance of content, and the interval time distribution, and then the given time series distribution curve of its top n retweets is fitted by a two-phase function, so as to predict the number of its retweets in one month. The phases in the function are divided by the lifecycle of the original tweet and different functions are used in the two phases. Experiment results show that our solution can address the problem of predicting the times of retweeting in microblogs with a satisfying precision.

To observe the effect of preventive acupuncture and moxibustion on blood lipid of menopause rats. Methods. Seventy 10-month-old SD rats with estrous cycle disorders were divided into three control groups and four treatment groups (n = 10/group) and another ten 3.5-month-old female SD rats were chosen as young control group. Preventive acupuncture and moxibustion were applied at Guanyuan (CV 4). Body weight growth rate has been recorded. Plasma total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), low density lipoprotein (LDL), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) levels and uterus E 2 level were measured. Results. Compared to young control group, plasma TC and LDL increased and uterus E-2 reduced significantly in 12-month-old control group. Compared to 12-month-old control group, plasma TC and LDL level and body weight growth rate decreased while HDL level increased remarkably in preventive acupuncture 12-month-old group. Compared to 14-month-old control group, plasma TC level and body weight growth rate decreased remarkably in preventive moxibustion 14-month-old group. Conclusions. Preventive acupuncture and moxibustion can significantly decrease the plasma TG and LDL, increase the plasma HDL, and prevent fat accumulation. Our finding suggests that preventive acupuncture and moxibustion have beneficial effects on blood lipid. Different treatment effects were found between preventive acupuncture and preventive moxibustion.

Methods: Mouse microglial cell line BV2 was transfected with pcDNA3.1(+)-hCysLT(1)R or pcDNA3.1(+)-hCysLT(2)R. The expression of relevant mRNAs and proteins in the cells was detected using RT-PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Phagocytosis was determined with flow cytometry analysis. The release of interleukin-1 beta(IL-1 beta) from the cells was measured using an ELISA assay. Results: The expression of CysLT(1)R or CysLT(2)R was considerably increased in the transfected BV2 cells, and the receptors were mainly distributed in the plasma membrane and cytosol. Treatment of the cells expressing CysLT(1)R or CysLT(2)R with CysLT receptor agonist LTD4 (0.1-100 nmol/L) concentration-dependently enhanced the phagocytosis, and increased mRNA expression and release of IL-1 beta. Moreover, the responses of hCysLT(1)R-BV2 cells to LTD4 were significantly larger than those of hCysLT(2)R-BV2 or WT-BV2 cells. Pretreatment of hCysLT(1)R-BV2 cells with the selective CysLT(1)R antagonist montelukast (1 mu mol/L) significantly blocked LTD4-induced phagocytosis as well as the mRNA expression and release of IL-1 beta, whereas the selective CysLT(2)R antagonist HAMI 3379 (1 mu mol/L) had no such effects. Conclusion: CysLT(1)R mediates LTD4-induced activation of BV2 cells, suggesting that CysLT1R antagonists may exert anti-inflammatory activity in brain diseases.

Herein, the self-assembly of a new bolaamphiphile bearing a bistriazole-pyrene unit leads to the formation of mono-molecule-layer nano-ribbons. The pi-pi stacking interaction between the rigid bistriazole-pyrene units and electrostatic screening contributed by the aromatic counterion tosyl groups are responsible for the 2D alignment of the molecules in the aggregate. Partial replacement of the tosyl groups causes a reduction in the width of the nano-ribbons and the coordination of triazole with Pd2+ ions results in the collapse of the self-assembled structure. This study supplies new clues for fabricating molecular level 2D nanostructures by bottom-up supramolecular assembly.

The pendant BODIPY unit has been directly conjugated to the polyacetylene backbone either through the 8 position of the BODIPY cores in P1, or through the 3 position in P2 and P3. Their optoelectronic properties have been investigated by UV-vis, FL, CV and Z-scan techniques. Interestingly, the spectroscopy results show that little electronic interaction exists between the BODIPY chromophoric units and the polyacetylene main chain for P1. However, the electronic interaction between the side pendant and the main chain becomes notable for P2 and P3, resulting in a significant broadening and red-shift of their UV-vis absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths in comparison with those of their respective monomers. The polymers display thermal stabilities and nonlinear optical properties that are dependent on the connectivities of the BODIPY pendants and the polyacetylene backbones. P1 exhibits relatively better thermal stability and poorer nonlinear optical properties than P1 and P2. The third-order nonlinear optical coefficient (chi((3))) of P1 is 8.5 x 10(-12) esu, which is shown to be similar to 5 times smaller than those of P2 and P3.

BRAIN STRUCTURE & FUNCTION			English	Article						Left hemiparalexia; Left hemialexia; Hemineglect dyslexia; Splenium of corpus callosum; Visual word form area (VWFA); FMRI	PATIENT; CORTEX	The objective of the study was to further elucidate the potential mechanisms underlying left hemiparalexia induced by a splenium lesion in corpus callosum. A patient KY, who had infarctions in the splenium and the left ventral medial occipitotemporal area, was examined with neuropsychological tests and fMRI. KY presented left hemiparalexia when he read aloud characters presented in central foveal field tachistoscopically as well as in free-view field. KY also showed left hemialexia for characters in left visual field, while no left hemiparalexia occurred when characters were presented in the right visual field. KY performed poorly in lexical decision tasks. He could judge the directions of Landolt's rings gaps in the left or right visual field equally. The result of fMRI indicated that characters in the left visual field could not activate the visual word form area (VWFA), such as left mid-fusiform cortex. All the above neuropsychological and fMRI findings have provided evidences against the assumption of left hemineglect dyslexia. Instead, they support the mechanism of disconnection of visual word form processing pathway. In conclusion, the evidences suggested that the visual information transmission of characters in the left visual field from right occipital area to the VWFA in the left hemisphere was interrupted by the splenium lesion.

Platelet-targeted FIX (2bF9) expression was introduced by transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transduced with 2bF9 lentivirus (LV). Sustained therapeutic levels of platelet-FIX expression were obtained in FIXnull mice that received 2bF9 LV-transduced HSCs. Approximately 6-39% of the platelets expressed FIX in the transduced recipients, which was sufficient to rescue the bleeding diathesis in FIXnull mice in tail clipping models. Sequential bone marrow transplantation demonstrated that platelet-FIX expression in the secondary recipients was sustained, leading to phenotypic correction. Notably, none of the transduced recipients developed anti-FIX antibodies after platelet gene therapy. Only one of the nine recipients developed a low titer of inhibitory antibodies (1.6 BU/ml) after challenge with rhFIX. These data suggest that platelet gene therapy can not only restore hemostasis but also induce immune tolerance in hemophilia B mice, indicating that this approach may be a promising strategy for gene therapy of hemophilia B in humans.

However, effective neuroprotectants are not available. Recent studies have shown that high mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), a proinflammatory cytokine, contributes to ischemic brain injury. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4), a water channel protein, is considered to play a pivotal role in ischemia-induced brain edema. More recently, studies have shown that pannexin 1 channels are involved in cerebral ischemic injury and the cellular inflammatory response. Here, we examined whether the pannexin 1 channel inhibitor probenecid could reduce focal ischemic brain injury by inhibiting cerebral inflammation and edema. Transient focal ischemia was induced in C57BL/6J mice by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 1 h. Infarct volume, neurological score and cerebral water content were evaluated 48 h after MCAO. Immunostaining, western blot analysis and ELISA were used to assess the effects of probenecid on the cellular inflammatory response, HMGB1 release and AQP4 expression. Administration of probenecid reduced infarct size, decreased cerebral water content, inhibited neuronal death, and reduced inflammation in the brain 48 h after stroke. In addition, HMGB1 release from neurons was significantly diminished and serum HMGB1 levels were substantially reduced following probenecid treatment. Moreover, AQP4 protein expression was downregulated in the cortical penumbra following post-stroke treatment with probenecid. These results suggest that probenecid, a powerful pannexin 1 channel inhibitor, protects against ischemic brain injury by inhibiting cerebral inflammation and edema.

Effect of exogenous potassium on photosynthesis and antioxidant enzymes of rice under iron toxicity	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PLANT PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article						Oryza sativa; iron stress; potassium; chlorophyll fluorescence; oxidation resistance	METABOLISM; INDUCTION	A solution culture experiment was conducted to determine the effects of different potassium concentrations on the chlorophyll fluorescence and oxidation resistance of the Fe2+-tolerant rice (Oryza sativa L.) genotype Xieyou 9308 and the Fe2+-sensitive genotype IIyou 838 exposed to 250 mg/L of Fe2+. The minimal fluorescence, maximum fluorescence efficiency, maximum fluorescence, and non-photochemical quenching coefficient showed no significant changes. However, the photochemical quenching coefficient increased. Under 200 mg/L K+ concentration, the effects of Fe2+ stress decreased. Compared with the control group, chlorophyll content and peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, and catalase activities decreased, whereas MDA content increased under Fe2+ stress. Exogenous K+ alleviated Fe2+ toxicity in the test subjects compared with the control group. Overall, external K+ could alleviate the toxic effects of Fe2+ toxicity.	[Gao, P. P.; Zheng, G.

The dihexyl-substituted dibenzotetrathienoacene derivative C6-DBTTA exhibits high stability which is evidenced by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), UV-vis spectroscopy and electrochemistry. X-ray diffraction measurements of the vacuum-evaporated thin films show strong diffraction and indicate that the molecules are stacked nearly perpendicular to the substrate. AFM images reveal that the morphology of thin films depended on the deposition temperature. Thin film FETs devices based on C6-DBTTA were constructed and showed high mobility up to 0.48 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and an on/off ratio over 10(7). These results suggest that this new dihexylated thienoacene is an important organic semiconductor for field effect transistors. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Mild-to-moderate hypothermia is known to attenuate brain inflammation, but its role in stroke-induced immunodepression (SIID) of the peripheral immune system remains unknown. This study investigated the effects in rats of moderate intra-ischemic hypothermia on SIID and brain inflammation. MethodsStroke was induced in rats by permanent distal middle cerebral artery occlusion combined with transient bilateral common carotid artery occlusion, while body temperature was reduced to 30 degrees C. Real-time PCR, flow cytometry, in vitro T-cell proliferation assays, in vivo delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reaction and confocal microscopy were used to study SIID and brain inflammation. ResultsBrief intra-ischemic hypothermia helped maintain certain leukocytes in the peripheral blood and spleen and enhanced T-cell proliferation in vitro and delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo, suggesting that hypothermia reduces SIID. In contrast, in the brain, brief intra-Ischemic hypothermia inhibited mRNA expression of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and proinflammatory mediators INF-, TNF-, IL-2, IL-1 and MIP-2. Brief intra-Ischemic hypothermia also attenuated the infiltration of lymphocytes, neutrophils (MPO+ cells) and macrophages (CD68(+) cells) into the ischemic brain, suggesting that hypothermia inhibited brain inflammation. ConclusionsBrief intra-ischemic hypothermia attenuated SIID and protected against acute brain inflammation.

This work extends in some sense the previous works, (Serre, 1987) and (Leveque and Temple, 1985), which provided the global existence of weak solutions for 2 x 2 strictly hyperbolic system and (Heibig, 1994) for n x n strictly hyperbolic system with smooth Riemann invariants.

They are generally resistant to the current anticancer agents. Successful anticancer therapy must consist of approaches that can target not only the differentiated cancer cells, but also cancer stem cells. Emerging evidence suggested that the dietary agent curcumin exerted its anti-cancer activities via targeting cancer stem cells of various origins such as those of colorectal cancer, pancreatic cancer, breast cancer, brain cancer, and head and neck cancer. In order to enhance the therapeutic potential of curcumin, this agent has been modified or used in combination with other agents in the experimental therapy for many cancers. In this mini-review, we discussed the effect of curcumin and its derivatives in eliminating cancer stem cells and the possible underlying mechanisms.

In a xenograft mouse model with injection of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells, tumor size was measured every other day. The insulin level and insulin receptor (IR) were increased in the breast cancer patient tissues. Insulin injected subcutaneously around the tumor site in mice caused increase in the size and weight of tumor masses, and promoted proliferation and migration of MCF-7 cells. The effects of insulin on the increase in the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells were abolished by pretreatment with the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) inhibitor PD98059. Insulin increased the phosphorylation of ERK in the MCF-7 cells. These results indicate that insulin promotes the growth of breast cancer in nude mice, and increases the proliferation and migration of MCF-7 human breast cancer cells via the ERK pathway.

Ion channels, in particular, K+ channels and Ca2+-permeable channels in endothelial cells, are essential to the production and function of endothelium-derived vasoactive factors. Impairment of coronary endothelial function occurs in open heart surgery that may result in reduction of coronary blood flow and thus in an inadequate myocardial perfusion. Hyperkalemic exposure and concurrent ischemia-reperfusion during cardioplegic intervention compromise NO and EDHF-mediated function and the impairment involves alterations of K+ channels, that is, K-ATP and K-Ca, and Ca2+-permeable TRP channels in endothelial cells. Pharmacological modulation of these channels during ischemia-reperfusion and hyperkalemic exposure show promising results on the preservation of NO and EDHF-mediated endothelial function, which suggests the potential of targeting endothelial K+ and TRP channels for myocardial protection during cardiac surgery.

The spirit of traditional Piying is to express rich emotion and stories through impromptu action change by professional artists. Now Piying gradually fades away in people's lives, encountering the risk of extinction. We focus on transforming the traditional Piying play into an interactive system, which can be seamlessly performed by ordinary people and bring a strong sense of immersion to the users. Two interactive systems were developed, with Kinect-based interaction or sensors, users can create own digital Piying animations by employing their body movement as input. A field study was presented with 20 students in a primary school. The result showed that our system was far more effective in emotion induction and Piying understanding than traditional one.

We employed resting-state functional MRI and graph-theory approaches to systematically chart the lifespan trajectory of the topological organization of human whole-brain functional networks in 126 healthy individuals ranging in age from 7 to 85 years. Brain networks were constructed by computing Pearson's correlations in blood-oxygenation-level-dependent temporal fluctuations among 1024 parcellation units followed by graph-based network analyses. We observed that the human brain functional connectome exhibited highly preserved non-random modular and rich club organization over the entire age range studied. Further quantitative analyses revealed linear decreases in modularity and inverted-U shaped trajectories of local efficiency and rich club architecture. Regionally heterogeneous age effects were mainly located in several hubs (e.g., default network, dorsal attention regions). Finally, we observed inverse trajectories of long- and short-distance functional connections, indicating that the reorganization of connectivity concentrates and distributes the brain's functional networks. Our results demonstrate topological changes in the whole-brain functional connectome across nearly the entire human lifespan, providing insights into the neural substrates Underlying individual variations in behavior and cognition. These results have important implications for disease connectomics because they provide a baseline for evaluating network impairments in age-related neuropsychiatric disorders. (C) 2013 The Authors.

Innate immune cell activation has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of these effects. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the role of CC-chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) in PM2.5-mediated inflammation and IR. METHODS: Wild-type C57BL/6 and CCR2(-/-) male mice were fed a high-fat diet and exposed to either concentrated ambient PM2.5 or filtered air for 17 weeks via a whole-body exposure system. We evaluated glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity. At euthanasia, blood, spleen, and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) were collected, and inflammatory cells were measured using flow cytometry. We used standard immuno blots, immuno histo chemical methods, and quantitative PCR (polymerase chain reaction) to assess pathways of interest involving insulin signaling, inflammation, and lipid and glucose metabolism in various organs. Vascular function was assessed using myography. RESULTS: PM2.5 exposure resulted in whole-body IR and increased hepatic lipid accumulation in the liver, which was attenuated in CCR2(-/-) mice by inhibiting SREBP1c-mediated transcriptional programming, decreasing fatty acid uptake, and suppressing p38 MAPK activity. Abnormal phosphorylation levels of AKT, AMPK in VAT, and adipose tissue macrophage content in wild-type mice were not present in CCR2(-/-) mice. However, the impaired whole-body glucose tolerance and reduced GLUT-4 in skeletal muscle in response to PM2.5 was not corrected by CCR2 deficiency. CONCLUSIONS: PM2.5 mediates IR by regulating VAT inflammation, hepatic lipid metabolism, and glucose utilization in skeletal muscle via both CCR2-dependent and -independent pathways. These findings provide new mechanistic links between air pollution and metabolic abnormalities underlying IR.

Recently developed measures of resting-state functional brain activity might provide neurobiological markers of brain disorders. Studying functional brain activity in SAD could enhance our understanding of its nature and possible treatment strategies. Functional network connectivity (measured using ICA-dual regression), and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (ALFF) were measured in 45 antidepressant-free patients (39.78 +/- 10.64, 30 f, 15 o) diagnosed with SAD and compared with age-, gender- and ethnicity-matched healthy controls (HCs) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. After correcting for Type 1 error at high model orders (inter-RSN correction), SAD patients showed significantly increased functional connectivity in 11 of the 47 identified RSNs. Increased functional connectivity involved RSNs such as visual, sensorimotor, and attentional networks. Moreover, our results revealed that SAD patients compared with HCs showed significant higher ALFF in the visual and right sensorimotor cortex. Abnormally altered functional activity detected in SAD supports previously reported attentional and psychomotor symptoms in patients suffering from SAD. Further studies, particularly under task conditions, are needed in order to specifically investigate cognitive deficits in SAD. Hum Brain Mapp 35:161-172, 2014. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

A total of 73 recruited participants were randomly allocated into two groups. The study group received a home visit and 2-4 telephone follow-ups from the trained community nurses assisted by nursing student volunteers. The control group received doctor-led hypertension management. Data was collected at recruitment and immediately after the 8-week program. Outcome measures included blood pressure readings, self-care adherence, self-efficacy, quality of life, and patient satisfaction. Participants from the study group led by nurses had significant improvement in self-care adherence, patient satisfaction post-intervention than those from the control group led by doctors. However, there were no statistical significant differences in blood pressure readings, quality of life and self-efficacy between the two groups. The findings show that the nurse-led hypertension management appears to be a promising way to manage hypertensive patients at the community level, particularly when the healthcare system is better integrated.

However, only some NHase genes have been reported and studied at the molecular level. In this study, we developed a genome mining method to discover Fe-type NHases from GenBank. The putative NHase gene from Pseudomottas putida F1 was cloned and functionally expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) by assisting of a putative activator gene adjacent to beta-subunit region. Three recombinant plasmids containing NHase gene or the activator gene were designed and constructed. Maximal enzyme activity was obtained when the structural and activator genes were transcribed as one unit in plasmid pCDFDuet-1 at 18 degrees C. However, the expressed product did not show any NHase activity when the downstream activator gene was ignored, and the product completely existed in insoluble inclusion body. The activator gene might be involved in protein folding of the alpha- and beta-subunits of NHase. In addition, the Fe-type NHase exhibited broad substrate specificity. The enzyme can efficiently hydrate aromatic nitriles, such as 3-cyanopyridine, 4-cyanopyridine, and benzonitrile, asides from aliphatic nitriles preferentially. Therefore, the recombinant NHase shows potential applications in some amides preparation. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Low chromosome numbers, 2n = 12 or 24, with large sizes were observed in these three sections. Our results suggest that the genus Carex might have originated or relictly restricted in the East Asia. Geographical distributions of diploid species are restricted in narrower areas, while those of tetraploid species are wider in East Asia. It is concluded that chromosomal variations in Siderostictae clade may have been caused by polyploidization and that tetraploid species may have been able to exploit their habitats by polyploidization.

Insufficient availability or extreme high levels of the nutrients significantly affect plant growth and development. Plants have evolved a series of mechanisms to adapt to unsuitable growth conditions where nutrient levels are too low or too high. microRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small RNAs, are known to mediate post-transcriptional regulation by transcript cleavage or translational inhibition. Besides regulating plant growth and development, miRNAs are well documented to regulate plant adaptation to adverse environmental conditions including nutrient stresses. In this review, we focus on recent progress in our understanding of how miRNAs are involved in plant response to stresses resulting from deficiency in nutrients, such as nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, copper and iron, as well as toxicities from heavy metal ions. Accumulated evidence indicates that miRNAs play critical roles in sensing the abundance of nutrients, controlling nutrient uptake and phloem-mediated long-distance transport, and nutrient homeostasis. miRNAs act as systemic signals to coordinate these physiological activities helping plants respond to and survive nutrient stresses and toxicities. Knowledge about how miRNAs are involved in plant responses to nutrient stresses promise to provide novel strategies to develop crops with improved nutrient use efficiency which could be grown in soils with either excessive or insufficient availability of nutrients.

Many plant miRNAs have been experimentally identified or predicted by bioinformatics mining of small RNA databases. However, the functions of these miRNAs remain largely unknown due to the lack of effective genetic tools. Here, we report a virus-based microRNA silencing (VbMS) system that can be used for functional analysis of plant miRNAs. VbMS is performed through tobacco rattle virus-based expression of miRNA target mimics to silence endogenous miRNAs. VbMS of either miR172 or miR165/166 caused developmental defects in Nicotiana benthamiana. VbMS of miR319 reduced the complexity of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) compound leaves. These results demonstrate that tobacco rattle virus-based VbMS is a powerful tool to silence endogenous miRNAs and to dissect their functions in different plant species.

Spatio-temporal variations and risk assessment of select heavy metals (Zn, Cu, Mn, Fe, Cr, Cd, and Pb) were investigated in water samples. During summer Mn (37.32 mu g/L), Fe (41.0 mu g/L), and Cd (1.18 mu g/L) concentrations were higher in the water samples, while the concentrations of Zn (86.12 mu g/L), Fe (42.0 mu g/L), and Pb (30.82 mu g/L) were dominant in winter. However, Cr exhibited elevated concentrations in both seasons. The health-risk assessment revealed that hazard quotient (HQ(ing)) and hazard index (HIing) values were near to the acceptable limit, indicating non-carcinogenic risk to the recipient via oral intake of water. The calculated values for chronical daily intake (CDI) were found in the order of Cr > Fe > Mn > Zn > Cd in summer and Zn > Fe > Cr > Pb > Mn > Cu during winter. The carcinogenic risk (CRing) via ingestion route for Cr, Cd, and Pb were noted higher than the acceptable limit (10). Multivariate statistical analysis such as cluster analysis (CA) and principal component analysis (PCA) results revealed that natural processes and anthropogenic activities were the main sources of water contamination. The data provided in this study are considered essential for reservoir remediation. The results suggested that quick action should be taken to protect the drinking water integrity of the Siling reservoir watershed from the different nonpoint pollution sources, especially the application of agricultural fertilizers.

The morphology and physical properties of PVA/pseudo-boehmite nanocomposites have been characterized systematically. Scanning electron microscopy investigations showed the homogeneous dispersion of pseudo-boehmite nanorods within PVA matrix even at very high nanorods loadings. The nanocomposites with 37.5 wt% pseudo-boehmite nanorods exhibit limit oxygen index (LOI) as high as 30.0 with the transmittance of more than 90% at the visible region and the enhanced refractive index. Moreover, the incorporation of the pseudo-boehmite nanorods increases the modulus and the tensile strength of PVA, indicating the significantly enhanced surface hardness of the nanocomposite. It is considered that the prepared PVA nanocomposites are not only useful as flame-retardant fibers, a long term pursued target for PVA fabrics, but also as optical appliances with its excellent transparency and high refractive index.

Amphiphilic polymeric micelle drug delivery systems could help to improve the activity and selectivity of DOX against tumor cells. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to investigate the interaction between DOX and ten hydrophobic acid modified chitosan oligosaccharides (COS). The pi-pi interactions in the systems with aromaticity have been found to contribute to a great part of the van der Waals interactions and play a significant role in the DOX loading process. The encapsulation of DOX by long-chain fatty acid-grafted COS mainly depends on a high binding strength and sandwiched configuration, where the hydrophobic interactions are essential to the encapsulation process. The solvent structure around DOX and the grafted COS was found to have a relationship with the way DOX and drug carrier bind to each other. Moreover, the results derived by our computational model were compared to the experimental data obtained in our lab and the data available in the literature. It was found that the interaction strength between DOX and hydrophobically modified COS has a strong correlation with the experimental quantities, like encapsulation efficiency and drug loading rate.

An arylmagnesium bromide was formed by reacting 4-bromophenol with a tert-butyldimethylsilyl protecting group and magnesium, which was then used to prepare the aza-BODIPY through a reaction with phthalonitrile. The unusually strong affinity between the fluoride anion and silicon is used to create a sensor dye, which exhibits a highly specific, rapid colorimetric and 'turn-off' fluorescence response for F- in solution and in living HeLa cells. With F-, there is enhanced intramolecular charge transfer within the S-1 state and this results in efficient nonradiative decay and hence in a marked decrease in fluorescence emission intensity.

However, whether these genes represent perturbations to a common but limited set of underlying molecular processes (pathways) that modulate risk to schizophrenia remains elusive, and it is not known whether these genes converge on common biological pathways (networks) or represent different pathways. In addition, the theoretical and genetic mechanisms underlying the strong genetic heterogeneity of schizophrenia remain largely unknown. Using 4 well-defined data sets that contain top schizophrenia susceptibility genes and applying protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis, we investigated the interactions among proteins encoded by top schizophrenia susceptibility genes. We found proteins encoded by top schizophrenia susceptibility genes formed a highly significant interconnected network, and, compared with random networks, these PPI networks are statistically highly significant for both direct connectivity and indirect connectivity. We further validated these results using empirical functional data (transcriptome data from a clinical sample). These highly significant findings indicate that top schizophrenia susceptibility genes encode proteins that significantly directly interacted and formed a densely interconnected network, suggesting perturbations of common underlying molecular processes or pathways that modulate risk to schizophrenia. Our findings that schizophrenia susceptibility genes encode a highly interconnected protein network may also provide a novel explanation for the observed genetic heterogeneity of schizophrenia, ie, mutation in any member of this molecular network will lead to same functional consequences that eventually contribute to risk of schizophrenia.

An open science resource for establishing reliability and reproducibility in functional connectomics	SCIENTIFIC DATA			English	Article							RESTING-STATE FMRI; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TEST-RETEST RELIABILITY; PHYSIOLOGICAL NOISE; HEAD MOTION; CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN; MULTICENTER; HOMOGENEITY; ARTIFACT	Efforts to identify meaningful functional imaging-based biomarkers are limited by the ability to reliably characterize inter-individual differences in human brain function. Although a growing number of connectomics-based measures are reported to have moderate to high test-retest reliability, the variability in data acquisition, experimental designs, and analytic methods precludes the ability to generalize results. The Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) is working to address this challenge and establish test-retest reliability as a minimum standard for methods development in functional connectomics. Specifically, CoRR has aggregated 1,629 typical individuals' resting state fMRI (rfMRI) data (5,093 rfMRI scans) from 18 international sites, and is openly sharing them via the International Data-sharing Neuroimaging Initiative (INDI). To allow researchers to generate various estimates of reliability and reproducibility, a variety of data acquisition procedures and experimental designs are included. Similarly, to enable users to assess the impact of commonly encountered artifacts (for example, motion) on characterizations of inter-individual variation, datasets of varying quality are included.

J	Hu, YB				Hu, Yanbo			Axisymmetric solutions of the two-dimensional Euler equations with a two-constant equation of state	NONLINEAR ANALYSIS-REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS			English	Article							RIEMANN PROBLEM; CHAPLYGIN-GAS; DYNAMICS; FLOW; LAWS	A family of self-similar and global bounded weak solutions are constructed rigorously for all positive time to the two-dimensional isentropic Euler equations with the equation of state p = A(1)rho(gamma 1) + A(2)rho(gamma 2) for initial pure radial velocity. The main difficulty is that the equations cannot be directly reduced to an autonomous system of ordinary differential equations. To deal with it, we first establish the global existence and the detailed structures of solutions to a new system under the axisymmetric and self-similar assumptions. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

In a previous study, we have identified a secretory antigen, Sia10, from S. iniae. In this study, we cloned and analyzed an hsp70 gene from a pathogenic V. harveyi strain. We found that purified recombinant Hsp70 possesses ATPase activity and, when used as a subunit vaccine, could induce protection in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) against V. harveyi infection. Based on this observation, we fused Hsp70 to Sia10 and thus obtained a chimeric antigen Sia10-Hsp70, which was expressed from a plasmid pTSH contained in Escherichia coli DH5 alpha. Western blot analysis showed that DH5 alpha/pTSH was able to secret Sia10-Hsp70 into the extracellular milieu. The potential of DH5 alpha/pTSH as a live vector vaccine was examined in a flounder model, which showed that DH5 alpha/pTSH induced effective protection against not only V. harveyi infection but also S. iniae infection. ELISA analysis showed that fish vaccinated with DH5 alpha/pTSH produced specific serum antibodies against both Hsp70 and Sia10.

J	Wang, Z; Ma, L; Shao, M; Ji, X				Wang, Zheng; Ma, Li; Shao, Min; Ji, Xiang			Differences in Incubation Length and Hatchling Morphology among Five Species of Oviparous Phrynocephalus Lizards (Agamidae) from China	ASIAN HERPETOLOGICAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Agamidae; Phrynocephalus lizards; oviparous species; egg incubation; incubation length; hatchling morphology	TOAD-HEADED LIZARDS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; PHENOTYPIC VARIATION; THERMAL PREFERENCE; PRZEWALSKII; TRAITS; SIZE; TOLERANCE; FRONTALIS; CONSTANT	We incubated eggs of five Phrynocephalus species (P. albolineatus, P. axillaries, P. grumgrzimailoi, helioscopus and P. przewalskii) at three constant temperatures (24 degrees C, 28 degrees C and 32 degrees C) to examine differences in incubation length and hatchling morphology among species and among temperature treatments. We combined data from this study with those reported previously for P frontalis and P versicolor to examine whether embryonic stage at laying is a causal factor for interspecific variation in incubation length, and whether the phylogenetic relationship inferred from hatchling morphology is consistent with the relationship based on mitochondrial DNA data. Mean values for incubation length differed among the five species studied herein and, in all these five species, incubation length decreased at a decreasing rate as temperature increased. In none of the five species did hatchling size (snout-vent length and body mass) and other morphological variables differ among the three temperature treatments. The seven oviparous Phrynocephalus lizards found in China differ from each other in hatchling morphology, and embryonic stage at laying is a causal factor of inter- and intra-specific variation in incubation length. The phylogenetic relationship inferred from hatchling morphology is not always consistent with the currently known relationship based on mitochondrial DNA data. Data from this study and those reported previously allow the conclusion that any Phrynocephalus species may have its unique position along the axis defined by hatchling morphology.

This is the first successful attempt to produce and characterize the thermoelectric properties of SiGe-based thermoelectric materials prepared at temperatures below the alloy's melting point through a magnesiothermic reduction of the silica-germania nanocomposite. We observe a thermoelectric power factor that is competitive with the literature record obtained for high energy ball milled nanocomposites. The large grain size in our hot pressed samples limits the thermoelectric figure of merit to 0.5 at 800 degrees C for an optimally doped Si80Ge20 alloy.

J	Ye, CY; Lu, Q				Ye, Chengyin; Lu, Qing			Bridge: a GUI package for genetic risk prediction	BMC GENETICS			English	Article						Gene-gene interactions; Optimal receiver operating characteristic curve	VARIANTS; FUTURE; TESTS	Background: Risk prediction models capitalizing on genetic and environmental information hold great promise for individualized disease prediction and prevention. Nevertheless, linking the genetic and environmental risk predictors into a useful risk prediction model remains a great challenge. To facilitate risk prediction analyses, we have developed a graphical user interface package, Bridge. Results: The package is built for both designing and analyzing a risk prediction model. In the design stage, it provides an estimated classification accuracy of the model using essential genetic and environmental information gained from public resources and/or previous studies, and determines the sample size required to verify this accuracy. In the analysis stage, it adopts a robust and powerful algorithm to form the risk prediction model. Conclusions: The package is developed based on the optimality theory of the likelihood ratio and therefore theoretically could form a model with high performance. It can be used to handle a relatively large number of genetic and environmental predictors, with consideration of their possible interactions, and so is particularly useful for studying risk prediction models for common complex diseases.

The maximum size and average compressive strength of the octahedral cBN are respectively 400 mu m and 47.5 N, which are larger than those reported. The morphology and size of the crystals depend closely on pressure and temperature, and a P-T diagram for the formation of the cBN crystals is obtained. The formation mechanism of the octahedral cBN crystals is proposed in terms of the Raman spectra and X-ray diffraction patterns. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Different from recently reported tetragonal ThCr2Si2-structured II-II-V based (Ba,K)(Zn,Mn)(2)As-2, the Ba1-yKyCd2-xMnxAs2 system has a hexagonal CaAl2Si2-type structure with the Cd2As2 layer forming a honeycomb-like network. The Mn concentration reaches up to x similar to 0.4. Magnetization measurements show that the samples undergo ferromagnetic transitions with Curie temperature up to 16 K. With low coercive field of less than 10 Oe and large magnetoresistance of about -70%, the hexagonal structured Ba1-yKyCd2-xMnxAs2 can be served as a promising candidate for spin manipulations.

The results suggested that the PN process was successfully set up through initial complete nitrification followed by adjusting the alkalinity-to-ammonium ratio (Alk/NH4+-N), also known as the 'initial complete nitrification and subsequent partial nitrification' (CNin-PNsub) strategy. A high nitrite accumulation ratio of approximately 98% and a maximum nitrite production rate of 0.91 kg N m(-3) day(-1) were attained under the conditions of 1.0 mol mol(-1) Alk/NH4+-N, 1.24 +/- 0.71 mg L-1 dissolved oxygen, 3.99 +/- 2.29 mg L-1 free ammonia and 0.69 +/- 0.30 mg N L-1 free nitrous acid. The stabilized effluent with an NO2--N/NH4+-N ratio of 1.15 +/- 0.06 was suitable for subsequently feeding the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (ANAMMOX) process. The modified Stover-Kincannon model was used to analyze the kinetic parameters, and the saturation constant (K-B) and maximum ammonium utilization rate (U-max) were determined to be 5.8 and 5.4 kg m(-3) day(-1), respectively.

Reliable prediction of the optimal temperature for seed germination is crucial for determining the suitable regions and favorable sowing timing for turf grass cultivation. In this study, a back-propagation-artificial-neural-network-aided dual quintic equation (BP-ANN-QE) model was developed to improve the prediction of the optimal temperature for seed germination. This BP-ANN-QE model was used to determine optimal sowing times and suitable regions for three Cynodon dactylon cultivars (C. dactylon, 'Savannah' and 'Princess VII'). Prediction of the optimal temperature for these seeds was based on comprehensive germination tests using 36 day/night (high/low) temperature regimes (both ranging from 5/5 to 40/40 degrees C with 5 degrees C increments). Seed germination data from these temperature regimes were used to construct temperature-germination correlation models for estimating germination percentage with confidence intervals. Our tests revealed that the optimal high/low temperature regimes required for all the three bermudagrass cultivars are 30/5, 30/10, 35/5, 35/10, 35/15, 35/20, 40/15 and 40/20 degrees C; constant temperatures ranging from 5 to 40 degrees C inhibited the germination of all three cultivars. While comparing different simulating methods, including DQEM, Bisquare ANN-QE, and BP-ANN-QE in establishing temperature based germination percentage rules, we found that the R-2 values of germination prediction function could be significantly improved from about 0.6940-0.8177 (DQEM approach) to 0.9439-0.9813 (BP-ANN-QE). These results indicated that our BP-ANN-QE model has better performance than the rests of the compared models. Furthermore, data of the national temperature grids generated from monthly-average temperature for 25 years were fit into these functions and we were able to map the germination percentage of these C. dactylon cultivars in the national scale of China, and suggested the optimum sowing regions and times for them.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of the decay psi(3686) -> Lambda(Sigma)over-bar(+/-) pi(-/+) + c.c	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a sample of 1:06 X 10(8) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector, we present the first observation of the decays of psi(3686) -> Lambda(Sigma) over bar (+) pi(-) + c.c. and psi(3686) -> Lambda(Sigma) over bar (-) pi(+) + c.c. The branching fractions are measured to be B(psi(3686) -> Lambda(Sigma) over bar (+) pi(-) + c.c.) = (1.40 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.13) X 10(-4) and B(psi(3686) -> Lambda (Sigma) over bar (-) pi(+) + c.c.) = (1.54 +/- 0.04 +/- 0.13) X 10(-4) where the first errors are statistical and the second ones systematic.

Despite intense recent efforts in exploring the dynamics of human behaviors, little is known about human-interest dynamics, partly due to the extreme difficulty in accessing the human mind from observations. However, the availability of large-scale data, such as those from e-commerce and smart-phone communications, makes it possible to probe into and quantify the dynamics of human interest. Using three prototypical "Big Data'' sets, we investigate the scaling behaviors associated with human-interest dynamics. In particular, from the data sets we uncover fat-tailed (possibly power-law) distributions associated with the three basic quantities: (1) the length of continuous interest, (2) the return time of visiting certain interest, and (3) interest ranking and transition. We argue that there are three basic ingredients underlying human-interest dynamics: preferential return to previously visited interests, inertial effect, and exploration of new interests. We develop a biased random-walk model, incorporating the three ingredients, to account for the observed fat-tailed distributions. Our study represents the first attempt to understand the dynamical processes underlying human interest, which has significant applications in science and engineering, commerce, as well as defense, in terms of specific tasks such as recommendation and human-behavior prediction.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a Charged Charmoniumlike Structure Z(c) (4020) and Search for the Z(c) (3900) in e(+)e(-) -> pi(+) pi(-)h(c)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								We study e(+)e(-) -> pi(+) pi(-)h(c) at center-of-mass energies from 3.90 to 4.42 GeV by using data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider. The Born cross sections are measured at 13 energies and are found to be of the same order of magnitude as those of e(+)e(-) -> pi(+) pi(-) J/Psi but with a different line shape. In the pi(+/-)h(c) mass spectrum, a distinct structure, referred to as Z(c)(4020) is observed at 4. 02 GeV/c(2). The Z(c)(4020) carries an electric charge and couples to charmonium. A fit to the pi(+/-)h(c) invariant mass spectrum, neglecting possible interferences, results in a mass of (4022.9 +/- 0.8 +/- 2.7) MeV/c(2) and a width of (7.9 +/- 2.7 +/- 2.6) MeV for the Z(c)(4020), where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic. The difference between the parameters of this structure and the Z(c) (4025) observed in the D*(D) over bar* final state is within 1.5 sigma, but whether they are the same state needs further investigation. No significant Z(c)(3900) signal is observed, and upper limits on the Z(c)(3900) production cross sections in pi +/- h(c) at center-of-mass energies of 4.23 and 4.26 GeVare set.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F.

Here, we show that Exo70, a component of the exocyst complex, undergoes isoform switching mediated by ESRP1, a pre-mRNA splicing factor that regulates EMT. Expression of the epithelial isoform of Exo70 affects the levels of key EMT transcriptional regulators such as Snail and ZEB2 and is sufficient to drive the transition to epithelial phenotypes. Differential Exo70 isoform expression in human tumors correlates with cancer progression, and increased expression of the epithelial isoform of Exo70 inhibits tumor metastasis in mice. At the molecular level, the mesenchymal-but not the epithelial-isoform of Exo70 interacts with the Arp2/3 complex and stimulates actin polymerization for tumor invasion. Our findings provide a mechanism by which the exocyst function and actin dynamics are modulated for EMT and tumor invasion.

The deformation forces of the classic demons algorithm were derived from image gradients by considering the deformation to decrease the intensity dissimilarity between images. However, the methods using the difference of image intensity for medical image registration are easily affected by image artifacts, such as image noise, non-uniform imaging and partial volume effects. The gradient magnitude image is constructed from the local information of an image, so the difference in a gradient magnitude image can be regarded as more reliable and robust for these artifacts. Then, registering medical images by considering the differences in both image intensity and gradient magnitude is a straightforward selection. In this paper, based on a diffeomorphic demons algorithm, we propose a chain-type diffeomorphic demons algorithm by combining the differences in both image intensity and gradient magnitude for medical image registration. Previous work had shown that the classic demons algorithm can be considered as an approximation of a second order gradient descent on the sum of the squared intensity differences. By optimizing the new dissimilarity criteria, we also present a set of new demons forces which were derived from the gradients of the image and gradient magnitude image. We show that, in controlled experiments, this advantage is confirmed, and yields a fast convergence.

This reflects an information gap in our understanding of the transcriptional programs required for different interneuron subtypes. Here, we have utilized the directed differentiation of stem cells into specific subpopulations of cortical interneurons as a means to identify some of these missing factors. To establish this approach, we utilized two factors known to be required for the generation of cINs, Nkx2-1 and DIx2. As predicted, their regulated transient expression greatly improved the differentiation efficiency and specificity over baseline. We extended upon this "cIN-primed" model in order to establish a modular system whereby a third transcription factor could be systematically introduced. Using this approach, we identified Lmo3 and Pou3f4 as genes that can augment the differentiation and/or subtype specificity of cINs in vitro.

BESlll Collaboration	Search for eta(c)(2S)h(c) -> p(p)over-bar decays and measurements of the chi(cJ) -> p(p)over-bar branching fractions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a sample of 1.06 x 10(8)psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII, the decays eta(c)(2S) -> p (p) over bar and h(c) -> p (p) over bar are searched for, where eta(c)(2S) and h(c) are reconstructed in the decay chains psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S), eta(c)(2S) -> p (p) over bar and psi(3686) -> pi(0)h(c), h(c) -> p (p) over bar, respectively. No significant signals are observed. The upper limits of the product branching fractions are determined to be B(psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S)) x B(eta(c)(2S) -> p (p) over bar) < 1.4 x 10(-6) and B(psi(3686) -> pi(0)h(c)) x B(h(c) -> p<(p)over bar>) < 1.3 x 10(-7) at the 90% C.L.. The branching fractions for chi(cJ) -> p<(p)over bar> (J = 0, 1, 2) are also measured to be (24.5 +/- 0.8 +/- 1.3, 8.6 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.5, 8.4 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.5) x 10(-5), which are the world's most precise measurements.

SOME CLASSES OF STRONGLY CLEAN RINGS	BULLETIN OF THE IRANIAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY			English	Article						Strongly J(n)-clean ring; 2 x 2 matrix; local ring	MATRIX-RINGS	A ring R is a strongly clean ring if every element in R is the sum of an idempotent and a unit that commute. We construct some classes of strongly clean rings which have stable range one. It is shown that such cleanness of 2 x 2 matrices over commutative local rings is completely determined in terms of solvability of quadratic equations.

We introduce the notion of the omega-torsionfree dimension of finitely generated R-modules and give some criteria for computing it. For any n a (c) 3/4 0, we prove that l.id (R) (omega) = r.id (S) (omega) a (c) 1/2 n if and only if every finitely generated left R-module and every finitely generated right S-module have omega-torsionfree dimension at most n, if and only if every finitely generated left R-module (or right S-module) has generalized Gorenstein dimension at most n.

The as-prepared samples exhibit higher photocatalytic activity for the degradation of Rhodamine B and phenol under visible light irradiation, attributed to the improvement of the photo-absorption property and the narrow band gap due to the dopants of S element. The higher efficiency for photodegradation of organic pollutant endows this material with a bright perspective in purification of waste water under visible-light irradiation.

James Yen and his colleagues initiated a new movement to teach the laborers They compiled a new basic Chinese characters book and a new paper called Chinese Laborer's Weekly, both of which were very useful in evangelizing and civilizing the laborers in order to positively affect the construction of a new nation at home This also blazed a new trail for removing illiteracy in modern China.

J	Min, C				Min, Chen			"Ferrying" Revisited in Western Poetic Tradition	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Western poetry; canon; ferry; translation; intercultural dialogue		This paper is a response to Yin Qiping's article "The Canon Is 'Ferry': The Spiritual Sources of the Contemporary Western Poetry", which begins with Paul Celan's poem "From Darkness to Darkness". A closer reading of the poem leads to the revelation of the poet's awareness of his own role as both a transferer (translator) and a transporter (ferryman), a responsibility that helps shake off the infamous "anxiety of influence". Arguably, such self-consciousness is not unique to contemporary poets who "name" misery and agony, but equally characteristic of those who "translate" the joy in life, e.g., John Betjeman and his kind. And for the poet, the "strangeness" arises not only through "bridging" the gaps between times, but also during intercultural and interartistic dialogues, which, as the paper attempts to, adds more dimensions to the "ferrying" in Western poetic tradition and reflects the complexity of the making of the contemporary canon of Western poetry.

Due to the stereotyped opinion of Neoclassicism, the elements of morality have not been given sufficient attention. On Alexander Pope's Poetry, written by Ma Xian, focuses on the moral themes of Pope's poetry. It analyzes and constructs an ethical system that is based on harmony, nature, reason, mean and order.

NSN) found in our group were studied using multiple bioinformatics approaches. The results showed that Y. NSN had 283 amino acids, a weight of 30,692.5 ku and a certain hydrophilic property. Y. NSN had a signal peptide, no transmembrane domains and disulphide bonds. Cleavage site in Y. NSN was between pos. 23 and 24. The prediction result of the secondary structure showed Y NSN was a coil structure-based protein. The ratio of alpha-helix, beta-folded and random coil were 18.73%, 16.96% and 64.31%, respectively. Active sites were pos. 124, 125, 127, 157, 165 and 169. Mg2+ binding site was pos. 157. Substrate binding sites were pos. 124,125 and 169. The analysis of multisequencing alignment and phylogenetic tree indicated that Y. NSN shared high similarity with the nuclease from Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081. The enzyme activity results showed that Y. NSN was a nuclease with good thermostability. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

An empirical study of 180 sample Chinese manufacturing firms shows that: (1) both proactive and reactive strategic flexibility have positive effects on innovation performance, (2) rate of environmental change significantly positively moderates the relationship between proactive strategic flexibility and innovation performance as well as significantly negatively moderates the relationship between reactive strategic flexibility and innovation performance and (3) turbulence of environmental change significantly positively moderates the relationship between reactive strategic flexibility and innovation performance. The results indicate that firms that face a fast rate of environmental change should direct more attention to proactive strategic flexibility; however, firms that face a high turbulence of environmental change should pay more attention to reactive strategic flexibility.

The substrate removal efficiencies of both reactors decreased as HRT decreased and NH4+-N-inf increased. The kinetics of these reactions were analyzed, and the Stover-Kincannon model was appropriate to describe the process kinetics of the reactors. In addition, an empirical model incorporating the influent substrate concentration and HRT adequately described R-1. Shock experiments were conducted in which the reactors were subjected to transient shock loads. The results showed that the operation of R-1 was more stable than that of R-0, especially in response to the substrate shocks. Subsequently, the properties of the ANAMMOX granules and the effects of the feeding protocol on those properties were investigated. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the second-stage regression, which uses the efficiency change and technical progress rates as dependent variables, we have found an increasing level of "equilibrium" efficiency and a robust convergence in China's agricultural efficiency; the latter has also been enhanced by China's integration into the global economy. Our results imply that the opening of the Chinese economy will end the decline in China's agricultural efficiency at last. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, skyline analysis is adopted to select candidate services with better QoS to facilitate the process of QoS-aware service composition. However, the fast increasing number of services, multiple QoS attributes to be considered, and dynamic service environment pose a big challenge to skyline service selection. In this paper, we present a parallel skyline service selection method to improve the efficiency by upgrading the MapReduce paradigm. An angle-based dataspace partitioning approach is employed in our MapReduce based skyline service selection. In particular, we explore the dominance power of local skyline services to improve the efficiency of selection, and present two detailed algorithms. To handle the dynamic nature of service environment, we employ Paper-Tape (PT) model which is used to rapidly locate varying services, and present a dynamic skyline service selection algorithm based on PT model. By experimenting over both real and synthetical datasets, we demonstrate the efficiency of our proposed methods.

The buckling patterns are found to nucleate at the film edge, and then propagate into the central area and follow an exponential growth behaviour. In the vicinity of the film edge, they generally have first a straight-sided shape perpendicular to the edge, and then transform into bifurcation and buckle network (or telephone-cord structures). Various geometrical parameters including spacing, length and width of the straight-sided buckles near the film edge have been measured and analysed in detail.

Large amounts of trehalose are stored in the diapause encysted embryos (cysts) of Artemia, which are not only vital to their extraordinary stress resistance, but also provide a source of energy for development after diapause is terminated. In the present study, a mechanism for the transcriptional regulation of trehalase was described in Artemia parthenogenetica. A trehalase-associated protein (ArTAP) was identified in Artemia-producing diapause cysts. ArTAP was found to be expressed only in diapause-destined embryos. Further analyses revealed that ArTAP can bind to a specific intronic segment of a trehalase gene. Knockdown of ArTAP by RNAi resulted in the release of cysts with coarse shells in which two chitin-binding proteins were missing. Western blotting showed that the level of trehalase was increased and apoptosis was induced in these ArTAP-knockdown cysts compared with controls. Taken together, these results show that ArTAP is a key regulator of trehalase expression which, in turn, plays an important role in trehalose metabolism during the formation of diapause cysts.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no chaotic maps based three-party password-authenticated key agreement (3PAKA) protocol without using a timestamp has been proposed, yet. In this paper, we propose the first chaotic maps-based 3PAKA protocol without a timestamp. The proposed protocol is not based on the traditional public key cryptosystem but is based on chaotic maps, which not only achieves perfect forward secrecy without using a timestamp, modular exponentiation and scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve, but is also robust to resist various attacks such as password guessing attacks, impersonation attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, etc.	[Xie, Qi; Yu, Xiuyuan] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Hangzhou Key Lab Cryptog & Network Secur, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhao, Jianmin] Zhejiang Normal Univ, Dept Comp Sci, Jinhua, Peoples R China	Xie, Q (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Hangzhou Key Lab Cryptog & Network Secur, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.	qixie68@126.com	XIE, Qi/AAO-2190-2020; Xie, Qi/E-3286-2015		National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61070153]; Major State Basic Research Development (973) Program of ChinaNational Basic Research Program of China [2013CB834205]; Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang provinceNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LZ12F02005]; Opening Fund of Top Key Discipline of Computer Software and Theory in Zhejiang Provincial Colleges at Zhejiang Normal University [ZSDZZZZXK35]	This research was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61070153), the Major State Basic Research Development (973) Program of China (No. 2013CB834205), Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang province (No. LZ12F02005), and Opening Fund of Top Key Discipline of Computer Software and Theory in Zhejiang Provincial Colleges at Zhejiang Normal University (No. ZSDZZZZXK35).		37	46	49	0	13	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	0924-090X	1573-269X		NONLINEAR DYNAM	Nonlinear Dyn.

In the initial decoding of calcium signals, Ca2+ sensor proteins that bind Ca2+ and activate downstream signaling components are implicated, thereby regulating specific physiological and biochemical processes. After calcineurin B-like proteins (CBLs) sense these Ca2+ signatures, these proteins interact selectively with CBL-interacting protein kinases (CIPKs), thereby forming CBL/CIPK complexes, which are involved in decoding calcium signals. Therefore, specificity, diversity, and complexity are the main characteristics of the CBL-CIPK signaling system. However, additional CBLs, CIPKs, and CBL/CIPK complexes remain to be identified in plants, and the specific functions of their abiotic and biotic stress signaling will need to be further dissected. Therefore, a much-needed synthesis of recent findings is important to further the study of CBL-CIPK signaling systems. Here, we review the structure of CBLs and CIPKs, discuss the current knowledge of CBL-CIPK pathways that decode calcium signals in Arabidopsis, and link plant responses to a variety of environmental stresses with specific CBL/CIPK complexes. This will provide a foundation for future research on genetically engineered resistant plants with enhanced tolerance to various environmental stresses.

Most researchers have focused on the transplantation process, but few have paid attention to cell safety concerns and rapid proliferation before transplantation. Using serum-free medium to culture stem cells may be an effective method to avoid problems associated with exogenous serum and the addition of growth factors to promote cell proliferation. Here, we randomly divided our serum-free cultures and treated them with different levels of epidermal growth factor (EGF). We then evaluated changes in rates of cell adhesion, proliferation, apoptosis, and cell cycle ratio as well as their differentiation potential. The data showed that all of these parameters were significantly different when comparing serum-free cultures with and without 10 nM/L EGF (p < 0.05/0.01); however, cells with 10 nM/L EGF did not respond differently than cells grown in standard serum-containing media without EGF (p > 0.05). In summary, our results demonstrate that 10 nM/L EGF was the optimal dose for serum-free culture, which can replace traditional standard serum medium for in vitro expansion of miniature pig bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells.

Recently, various attempts have been tried to propose different models, resulting in either power-law or exponential degree distributions. However, many empirical results show that the user degree distribution actually follows a shifted power-law distribution, the so-called Mandelbrot's law, which cannot be fully described by previous models. In this paper, we propose an evolving model, considering two different user behaviors: random and preferential attachment. Extensive empirical results on two real bipartite networks, Delicious and CiteULike, show that the theoretical model can well characterize the structure of real networks for both user and object degree distributions. In addition, we introduce a structural parameter p, to demonstrate that the hybrid user behavior leads to the shifted power-law degree distribution, and the region of power-law tail will increase with the increment of p. The proposed model might shed some lights in understanding the underlying laws governing the structure of real online bipartite networks. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The secondary injury in traumatic brain injury consists of a complex cascade of processes that simultaneously react to the primary injury to the brain. This cascade has been the target of numerous therapeutic agents investigated over the last 30 years, but no neuroprotective treatment option is currently available that improve neurological outcome after traumatic brain injury. Progesterone has long been considered merely a female reproductive hormone. Numerous studies, however, show that progesterone has substantial pleiotropic properties as a neuroprotective agent in both animal models and humans. Here, we review the increasing evidence that progesterone can act as a neuroprotective agent to treat traumatic brain injury and the mechanisms underlying these effects. Additionally, we discuss the current progress of clinical studies on the application of progesterone in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries.

We compared both techniques to evaluate their efficacy in treating morbid obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Methods: We searched the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register databases, Medline, Embase, ISI databases and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of LRYGB and LSG for morbid obesity or T2DM published in any language. Statistical analyses were carried out using RevMan software. Results: Five worldwide RCTs with 196 patients in the LRYGB group and 200 in the LSG group were included in our analysis. Compared with patients who had LSG, those who had LRYGB had a higher remission rate of T2MD, lost more weight and had lower low-density lipoprotein, triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment index and insulin levels. There was no difference in the reoperation rate between the groups. However, patients treated with LRYGB had a higher incidence of complication than those treated with LSG. Conclusion: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that LRYGB is more effective than LSG for the surgical treatment of T2DM and control of metabolic syndrome. However, LSG is safer and has a reduced rate of complications. Further high-quality RCTs with long follow-up periods are needed to provide more reliable evidence.

The spectroscopic properties of the dyes were investigated in various solvents and in films to assess the suitability of these compounds for optoelectronic applications. A triphenylsilylphenyl substituted pyrene was found to exhibit intense emission in the solid state with an absolute fluorescence quantum yield (Phi(F)) of 0.65. In contrast, the emission properties of a triphenylsilylphenyl(ethynyl) substituted pyrene were found to be somewhat weaker in the solid state (Phi(F) = 0.16) and solvent polarity dependent in solution. Magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations have been used to analyze the structure-property relationships with Michl's perimeter model used as a conceptual framework for rationalizing the key trends.

For example, it is unclear whether intrinsic activity can also predict task-evoked deactivation and whether the rest-task relationship is dependent on task load. In this study, we addressed these issues on 40 healthy control subjects using resting-state and task-driven [N-back working memory (WM) task] functional magnetic resonance imaging data collected in the same session. Using amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) as an index of intrinsic resting-state activity, we found that ALFF in the middle frontal gyrus and inferior/superior parietal lobules was positively correlated with WM task-evoked activation, while ALFF in the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, superior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, and fusiform gyrus was negatively correlated with WM task-evoked deactivation. Further, the relationship between the intrinsic resting-state activity and task-evoked activation in lateral/superior frontal gyri, inferior/superior parietal lobules, superior temporal gyrus, and midline regions was stronger at higher WM task loads. In addition, both resting-state activity and the task-evoked activation in the superior parietal lobule/precuneus were significantly correlated with the WM task behavioral performance, explaining similar portions of intersubject performance variance. Together, these findings suggest that intrinsic resting-state activity facilitates or is permissive of specific brain circuit engagement to perform a cognitive task, and that resting activity can predict subsequent task-evoked brain responses and behavioral performance.

Understanding the effects of a new grazing policy: the impact of seasonal grazing on shrub demography in the Inner Mongolian steppe	JOURNAL OF APPLIED ECOLOGY			English	Article						Caragana intermedia; elasticity; grazing; integral projection model; Life Table Response Experiments; semi-arid sandland; shrub demography; stochasticity	INTEGRAL PROJECTION MODELS; HERB LATHYRUS-VERNUS; POPULATION-DYNAMICS; ENVIRONMENTAL STOCHASTICITY; SEMIARID SAVANNA; ELASTICITIES; PERFORMANCE; PLANTS; RESTORATION; VARIABILITY	Grazing by livestock is a common land use in arid and semi-arid areas. Developing sustainable grazing regimes that conserve vegetation and maintain productivity is therefore important in these ecosystems. To solve environmental problems induced by overgrazing in Chinese semi-arid regions, the Chinese government has recently implemented a new policy of seasonal grazing, with no grazing from April to July. While this policy has been implemented in huge areas, its consequences for grazed plant populations have not been assessed so far. We evaluated the demographic consequences of seasonal grazing for Caragana intermedia, a long-lived dominant shrub serving as a main food source for livestock in Inner Mongolia, China. Controlled seasonally grazed and ungrazed populations were monitored during 2007-2009, and their vital rates were compared. We then constructed integral projection models (IPMs) to analyse the effects of seasonal grazing on population dynamics. Seasonal grazing negatively affected two vital rates: seedling survival and seedling recruitment were 25-71% and 69-91% lower in the seasonally grazed treatment than in the ungrazed situation, respectively. Seasonal grazing had a minimal effect on adult survival and growth, but improved juvenile survival by 8-31%. Despite its effects on several vital rates, seasonal grazing did not significantly affect long-term population growth rates (), which remained close to unity in both grazed and ungrazed areas based on deterministic and stochastic analyses. An elasticity analysis showed that population growth rate was mainly governed by the high survival of large adults. Results of Life Table Response Experiments (LTREs) revealed that variation in population growth rates across treatments and years was more strongly governed by temporal differences than by grazing.Synthesis and applications. Our study showed that the relatively large changes in vital rates induced by seasonal grazing did not affect population growth rates. Caragana intermedia populations can be sustained under the seasonal grazing regime probably because the grazing intensity is moderate and because this species has a high probability of adult survival under grazing. Plant species with similar life-history traits to C.intermedia are likely to offer good opportunities for sustainable seasonal grazing regimes in arid and semi-arid inland ecosystems.

The rietveld refinement of the powder XRD data confirms that Fe3GeTe2 crystallizes in the space group p6(3)/mmc. The chi(T), C(T), and rho(T) data indicate bulk ferromagnetic ordering at T-C = 220 K with a saturation moment of 1.625 mu(B)/Fe at zero temperature. The magnetic measurements of the external magnetic field H applied along the c-axis and ab-plane show a large anisotropy in this material. We found that the modified Arrott plot (M-4-H/M) rather than the M-2-H/M plot is obeyed in this material. The generalized Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio indicates an itinerant magnetism in this material. The spin fluctuation parameters are estimated and the magnetic properties are discussed in the framework of the self-consistent renormalization (SCR) and Takahashi theory of spin fluctuations.

To favor high-drug or enzyme loading on the nanoparticles, they are incorporated into mesoporous materials to form a hybrid support with the consequent reduction of magnetization saturation. The direct synthesis of mesoporous structures appears to be of interest. To this end, magnetite nanoparticles have been synthesized using a one pot co-precipitation reaction at room temperature in the presence of different bases, such as NaOH, KOH or (C2H5)(4)NOH. Magnetite shows characteristics of superparamagnetism at room temperature and a saturation magnetization (Ms) value depending on both the crystal size and the degree of agglomeration of individual nanoparticles. Such agglomeration appears to be responsible for the formation of mesoporous structures, which are affected by the pH, the nature of alkali, the slow or fast addition of alkaline solution and the drying modality of synthesized powders.

Here, we had cloned and sequenced the cDNA of a mammalian KIFC1 homologue (termed ec-KIFC1) from the total RNA of the testis of the reptile Eumeces chinensis. The full-length sequence was 2,339 bp that contained a 216 bp 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), a 194 bp 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and a 1,929 bp open reading frame that encoded a special protein of 643 amino acids (aa). The calculated molecular weight of the putative ec-KIFC1 was 71 kDa and its estimated isoelectric point was 9.47. The putative ec-KIFC1 protein owns a tail domain from 1 to 116 aa, a stalk domain from 117 to 291 aa and a conserved carboxyl motor domain from 292 to 642 aa. Protein alignment demonstrated that ec-KIFC1 had 45.6, 42.8, 44.6, 36.9, 43.7, 46.4, 45.1, 55.6 and 49.8 % identity with its homologues in Mus musculus, Salmo salar, Danio rerio, Eriocheir sinensis, Rattus norvegicus, Homo sapiens, Bos taurus, Gallus gallus and Xenopus laevis, respectively. Tissue expression analysis showed the presence of ovary, heart, liver, intestine, oviduct, testis and muscle. The phylogenetic tree revealed that ec-KIFC1 was more closely related to vertebrate KIFC1 than to invertebrate KIFC1. In situ hybridization showed that the ec-KIFC1 mRNA was localized in the periphery of the nuclear membrane and the center of the nucleus in early spermatids. In mid spermatids, the ec-KIFC1 had abundant expression in the center of nucleus, and was expressed in the tail and the anterior part of spermatids. In the late spermatid, the nucleus gradually became elongated, and the ec-KIFC1 mRNA signal was still centralized in the nucleus. In mature spermatids, the signal of the ec-KIFC1 gradually became weak, and was mainly located at the tail of spermatids. Therefore, the ec-KIFC1 probably plays a critical role in the spermatogenesis of E. chinensis.

However, most R-fMRI studies on functional hubs mainly utilize traditional R-fMRI data with relatively low sampling rates (e.g., repetition time [TR] = 2 s). R-fMRI data scanned with higher sampling rates are important for the characterization of reliable functional connectomes because they can provide temporally complementary information about functional integration among brain regions and simultaneously reduce the effects of high frequency physiological noise. Here, we employed a publicly available multiband R-fMRI dataset with a sub-second sampling rate (TR = 645 ms) to identify global hubs in the human voxel-wise functional networks, and further examined their test-retest (TRT) reliability over scanning time. We showed that the functional hubs of human brain networks were mainly located at the default-mode regions (e.g., medial prefrontal and parietal cortex as well as the lateral parietal and temporal cortex) and the sensorimotor and visual cortex. These hub regions were highly anatomically distance-dependent, where short-range and long-range hubs were primarily located at the primary cortex and the multimodal association cortex, respectively. We found that most functional hubs exhibited fair to good TRT reliability using intraclass correlation coefficients. Interestingly, our analysis suggested that a 6-minute scan duration was able to reliably detect these functional hubs. Further comparison analysis revealed that these results were approximately consistent with those obtained using traditional R-fMRI scans of the same subjects with TR = 2500 ms, but several regions (e.g., lateral frontal cortex, paracentral lobule and anterior temporal lobe) exhibited different TRT reliability. Finally, we showed that several regions (including the medial/lateral prefrontal cortex and lateral temporal cortex) were identified as brain hubs in a high frequency band (02-03 Hz), which is beyond the frequency scope of traditional R-fMRI scans. Our results demonstrated the validity of multiband R4MRI data to reliably detect functional hubs in the voxel-wise whole-brain networks, which motivated the acquisition of high temporal resolution R-fMRI data for the studies of human brain functional connectomes in healthy and diseased conditions.

A downstream gene adjacent to the beta-subunit was necessary for the functional expression of the recombinant NHase. The structural gene order of the Co-type NHase was alpha-subunit beyond beta-subunit, different from the order typically reported for Co-type NHase genes. The NHase exhibited adequate thermal stability, with a half-life of 1.5 h at 50 C. The NHase efficiently hydrated 3-cyanopyridine to produce nicotinamide. In a 1-L reaction mixture, 3.6 mol of 3-cyanopyridine was completely converted to nicotinamide in four feedings, exhibiting a productivity of 187 g nicotinamide/g dry cell weight/h. An industrial auto-induction medium was applied to produce the recombinant NHase in 10-L fermenter. A glycerol-limited feeding method was performed, and a final activity of 2170 U/mL culture was achieved. These results suggested that the recombinant NHase was efficiently cloned and produced in E. coli. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The snake is listed as a vulnerable species according to the China Red Data Book of Endangered Animals. To develop effective conservation strategies for the snake, we need a better understanding of gene flow, population structure and evolutionary history of this species. One approach for achieving this goal is to use microsatellites. Here, we characterize 8 polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from G. brevicaudus genomic libraries. Twelve individuals were collected from Xiaoshan population in Zhejiang, China. These markers revealed a high degree of genetic diversity (7-16 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (H (O) ranged from 0.667-1.000, and H (E) ranged from 0.822 to 0.960). No locus exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci. These microsatellite markers will be useful for future studies focusing on paternity test, population structure and evolutionary history of G. brevicaudus.

Emerging evidence suggests that cellular senescence also acts as a potent tumor suppression mechanism that prevents the oncogenic transformation of primary human cells. Recent reports have indicated that miRNAsact as key modulators of cellular senescence by targeting critical regulators of the senescence pathways. We previously reported that miR-127 is up-regulated in senescent fibroblasts. In this report, we identified miR-127 as a novel regulator of cellular senescence that directly targets BCL6. We further showed that miR-127 is down-regulated in breast cancer tissuesand that this down-regulation is associated with up-regulation of BCL6. Over-expression of miR-127 or depletion of BCL6 inhibits breast cancer cell proliferation. Our data suggest that miR-127 may function as a tumor suppressor that modulates the oncogene BCL6.

The Wiedemann-Franz law in the putative one-dimensional metallic phase of PrBa2Cu4O8	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							THERMAL TRANSPORT; CONDUCTIVITY; FERMI; RESISTIVITY; SYSTEMS; CU	The nature of the electronic state of a metal depends strongly on its dimensionality. In a system of isolated conducting chains, the Fermi-liquid (quasiparticle) description appropriate for higher dimensions is replaced by the so-called Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid picture characterized by collective excitations of spin and charge. Temperature is often regarded as a viable tuning parameter between states of different dimensionality, but what happens once thermal broadening becomes comparable to the interchain hopping energy remains an unresolved issue, one that is central to many organic and inorganic conductors. Here we use the ratio of the thermal to electrical conductivities to probe the nature of the electronic state in PrBa2Cu4O8 as a function of temperature. We find that despite the interchain transport becoming non-metallic, the charge carriers within the CuO chains appear to retain their quasiparticle nature. This implies that temperature alone cannot induce a crossover from Fermi-liquid to Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid behaviour in quasi-one-dimensional metals.	[Bangura, A.

However, many recommendation algorithms suffer from the data sparsity problem, i.e. the user-object bipartite networks are so sparse that algorithms cannot accurately recommend objects for users. This data sparsity problem makes many well-known recommendation algorithms perform poorly. To solve the problem, we propose a recommendation algorithm based on the semi-local diffusion process on the user-object bipartite network. The simulation results on two sparse datasets, Amazon and Bookcross, show that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods especially for those small-degree users. Two personalized semi-local diffusion methods are proposed which further improve the recommendation accuracy. Finally, our work indicates that sparse online systems are essentially different from the dense online systems, so it is necessary to reexamine former algorithms and conclusions based on dense data in sparse systems.

In the present paper, we will show that a much better sensitivity (similar to 17422 nm/RIU) can be obtained by using double circular-holes with an appropriate interval. The influence of the double-hole interval on the performance of sensing applications is also characterized. A sinusoidal pattern of the sensitivity can be found as the interval increases. However, the intensity of the resonant peak (i.e., the detectability for sensing applications) significantly oscillates as the interval varies.

To resolve this enigma, we investigate the disorder effects of nonmagnetic Zn impurities in the strong (unitary) scattering limit on various properties of the system in the s(+/-)-wave superconducting pairing state. The lattice Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation (BdG) is solved self-consistently based on a minimal two-orbital model with an extended range of impurity concentrations. We find that Zn impurity is best modeled as a defect, where charge is mainly localized, but scattering is extended over a few lattice sites. With increasing Zn concentration, the density of states shows a gradual filling of the gap, revealing the impurity-induced pair-breaking effect. Moreover, both the disorder configuration-averaged superconducting order parameter and the superfluid density are dramatically suppressed toward the dirty limit, indicating the violation of the Anderson theorem for conventional s-wave superconductors and the breakdown of the Abrikosov-Gorkov theory for impurity-averaged Green's functions. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting phase is fully suppressed close to the critical impurity concentration of roughly n(imp) approximate to 10%, in agreement with recent experiments.

The spectroscopic and electrochemical behaviors of the carbazole derivatives demonstrate that the carbazole unit interacts with the electron-accepting group through the pi-conjugated spacer, thus leading to the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT). The pyridine-substituted carbazole derivatives show significant sensing and coordinating properties toward a wide range of metal cations. Compound S2 exhibits fluorescence enhancement upon association with transition metal cations, and compound V3 shows high selectivity for Cu2+ among this series of materials. DFT calculations indicate the different association abilities of the dyes and the enhancement of ICT upon addition of the metal cations.

Ethyltrimethoxysilane was obtained in excellent yields and selectivities in the presence of iodine. A kinetic model on the basis of the consumption of trimethoxysilane was built up for the hydrosilylation reaction catalyzed either by ruthenium trichloride hydrate alone or by ruthenium trichloride hydrate doped with iodine. Kinetic parameters were regressed from the experimental data. The results indicated that the hydrosilylation reaction of ethylene gas with trimethoxysilane was a first order reaction process. With the addition of iodine, the apparent activation energy of this reaction significantly decreased from 56.93 to 29.97 kJ mol(-1), which is in good agreement with the results observed in the reaction.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of a structure at 1.84 GeV/c(2) in the 3(pi(+)pi(-)) mass spectrum in J/psi -> gamma 3(pi(+) pi(-)) decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BARYONIUM; GLUEBALL; X(1835); STATE; QCD	With a sample of 225.3 x 10(6) J/psi events taken with the BESIII detector, the decay J/psi -> gamma 3(pi(+) pi(-)) is analyzed. A structure at 1.84 GeV/c(2) is observed in the 3(pi(+) pi(-)) invariant mass spectrum with a statistical significance of 7.6 sigma. The mass and width are measured to be M = 1842.2 +/- 4.2(-2.6)(+7.1) MeV/c(2) and Gamma = 83 +/- 14 +/- 11 MeV. The product branching fraction is determined to be B(J/psi -> gamma X(1840) x B(X(1840) -> 3(pi(+)pi(-))) = (2.44 +/- 0.36(-0.74)(+0.60)) x 10(-5). No eta' signals are observed in the 3(pi(+) pi(-)) invariant mass spectrum, and the upper limit of the branching fraction for the decay eta' -> 3(pi(+) pi(-)) is set to be 3.1 x 10(-5) at a 90% confidence level.

We found that the zero-field electronic specific-heat data, Ces(T) (0.5 K <= T < 3.7 K) in the superconducting state can be fitted with a two-gap BCS model, indicating that TlNi2Se2 seems to be a multiband superconductor, which is consistent with the band calculation for the isostructural KNi2S2. It is also found that the electronic specific-heat coefficient in the mixed state gamma(N)(H) exhibits a H-1/2 behavior, which is considered as a common feature of the d-wave superconductors. TlNi2Se2, as a d-electron system with heavy electron superconductivity, may be a bridge between cuprate-or iron-based and conventional heavy-fermion superconductors.

Here, we investigated the potential associations between 19 SNPs of PLCE1 and susceptibility to ESCC in 222 cases and 326 controls from a pure ethnic population of Kazakh. Real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry were performed to detect the PLCE1 expression levels and evaluate their association with PLCE1 polymorphism. We found that only 4 SNPs (rs753724, rs11187842, rs2274223, and rs12263737) with moderate linkage disequilibrium (LD) confer significantly increased risk of ESCC, with the ORs ranging from 1.43 to 2.04, and there was a risk allele dose-dependent increase in ESCC risk (P-trend = 0.043). Especially, the risk effects of rs2274223 were more evident in poor differentiation and advanced clinical stages of Kazakh ESCC. Additionally, the significantly lowest PLCE1 mRNA expression was found in the KYSE-150 cell line having no risk alleles compared with other three cell lines having risk alleles, and the normal tissues of both homozygous mutant type of PLCE1 rs12263737 and rs2274223 had a higher PLCE1 staining score than that of homozygous wild type. Our findings suggested that genetic variants in PLCE1 might serve as candidate markers for Kazakh ESCC susceptibility, and these LD variants might influence ESCC risk individually and jointly by promoting the messenger RNA and protein expression of the gene.

This study was to explore the influence of mass migration on the dynamics of Mycobacterium (M.) tuberculosis in Beijing, the capital and an urban area of China. Methods Three hundred and thirty-six M. tuberculosis strains from the Changping district, where the problem of urban migrants was more pronounced than in other Beijing regions, were genotyped by Spoligotyping, large sequence polymorphisms (LSPs 105 and 181), and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) typing. Based on the genotype data, the phylogeny of the isolates was studied. Results In Changping district, the proportion of Beijing lineage M. tuberculosis isolates amounted to 89.0% (299/336), among which 86.6 % (252) belonged to the modern lineage. The frequency of modern Beijing lineage strains is so high (around 75% (252/336)) that associated risk factors affecting the tuberculosis epidemic cannot be determined. The time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA) of the Beijing lineage strains was estimated to be 5073 (95% CI: 4000-6200) years. There was no significant difference in the genetic variation of Beijing isolates from urban migrants and local residents. Conclusions The clone of modern Beijing lineage M. tuberculosis, which is dominant in the Beijing area, most likely started to expand with the five thousand-year-old Chinese civilization. In the future, with the urbanization in the whole of China, modern Beijing lineage M. tuberculosis may gain the larger geographical spread.

This "gain-of-function" has been linked to the UNE-S domain added to vertebrate SerRS during evolution. However, the significance of two insertions also specific to higher eukaryotic SerRS remains elusive. Here, we determined the crystal structure of human SerRS in complex with Ser-SA, an aminoacylation reaction intermediate analog, at 2.9 angstrom resolution. Despite a 70 angstrom distance, binding of Ser-SA in the catalytic domain dramatically leverages the position of Insertion I in the tRNA binding domain. Importantly, this leverage is specific to higher eukaryotes and not seen in bacterial, archaeal, and lower eukaryotic SerRSs. Deletion of Insertion I does not affect tRNA binding but instead reduce the catalytic efficiency of the synthetase. Thus, a long-range conformational and functional communication specific to higher eukaryotes is found in human SerRS, possibly to coordinate translation with vasculogenesis.

Methods: This cross-sectional study was performed on 15,236 participants >= 35 years of age (6,313 men [41.4%] and 8,923 women [58.6%]). Each participant's weight, height, waist circumference (WC), and hipline circumference (HC) were measured, and demographic and socioeconomic data were collected using questionnaires. Results: The mean body mass index (BMI) values were 23.31 +/- 2.96 and 23.89 +/- 3.23 kg m(-2) and the mean WC values were 79.13 +/- 8.43 and 79.54 +/- 8.27 cm for men and women, respectively. The age-standardized prevalence rates of overweight (BMI >= 24.0 kg m(-2)), general obesity (BMI >= 28.0 kg m(-2)), and abdominal obesity (WC >= 85 cm for men and >= 80 cm for women) were 32.0%, 6.7%, and 27.0% for men and 35.1%, 9.7%, and 48.3% for women, respectively. All gender differences were statistically significant (p < 0.001). In addition, the age-specific prevalence rates of general and abdominal obesity slowly decreased among men but sharply increased among women as age increased (p < 0.001). In subsequent logistic regression analysis, educational level was negatively associated with both general obesity and abdominal obesity among women but positively associated with abdominal obesity among men. No significant correlation was found between obesity and income. Conclusions: These results suggest a high prevalence of obesity which might differ by gender and age, and an inverse association among women and a mixed association among men noted between education and obesity in our locality. Preventive and therapeutic programs are warranted to control this serious public health problem. The gender-specific characteristics of populations at high-risk of developing obesity should be taken into consideration when designing interventional programs.

However, finger vein images are easily affected by influences such as image translation, orientation, scale, scattering, finger structure, complicated background, uneven illumination, and collection posture. All these factors may contribute to inaccurate region of interest (ROI) definition, and so degrade the performance of finger vein identification system. To improve this problem, in this paper, we propose a finger vein ROI localization method that has high effectiveness and robustness against the above factors. The proposed method consists of a set of steps to localize ROIs accurately, namely segmentation, orientation correction, and ROI detection. Accurate finger region segmentation and correct calculated orientation can support each other to produce higher accuracy in localizing ROIs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the finger vein image database, MMCBNU_6000, to verify the robustness of the proposed method. The proposed method shows the segmentation accuracy of 100%. Furthermore, the average processing time of the proposed method is 22 ms for an acquired image, which satisfies the criterion of a real-time finger vein identification system.

However, accumulating evidence indicates that telomerase reverse transcriptase may have fundamental biological functions independent of its enzymatic activity in telomere maintenance. In this study, the ectopic expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and its catalytic mutant hTERT K626A induced cancer cell invasion accompanied by the up-regulation of the metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP1, -3, -9, and -10. Both hTERT and hTERT K626A induced MMP9 mRNA expression and promoter activity in an NF-B-dependent manner. hTERT and hTERT K626A also regulated the expression of several NF-B target genes in cancer cell lines. Furthermore, both hTERT and hTERT K626A interacted with NF-B p65 and increased NF-B p65 nuclear accumulation and DNA binding. A mammalian 1-hybrid assay showed a functional interplay between hTERT and NF-B p65 that may mediate NF-B-dependent transcription activation in cells. Together, these data reveal a telomere-independent role for telomerase as a transcriptional modulator of the NF-B signaling pathway and a possible contributor to cancer development and progression.Ding, D., Xi, P., Zhou, J., Wang, M., Cong, Y.-S.

The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and determination coefficients (R-2) were used to assess their predictability of nitrogen concentrations. For all spectral variables (VIs and hyperspectral reflectance), the GRNN method produced more accurate estimates of nitrogen concentrations than did the SRBF method at all ranges of nitrogen concentrations, and the better agreements between the measured and the predicted nitrogen concentration were obtained with the GRNN method. This indicated that the GRNN method is prior to the SRBF method in estimation of nitrogen concentrations. Among the VIs, the Modified Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index (MCARI), MCARI(1510), and Transformed Chlorophyll Absorption in Reflectance Index are better than the others in estimating oilseed rape canopy nitrogen concentrations. Compared to the results from VIs, the hyperspectral reflectance data also gave an acceptable estimation. The study showed that nitrogen concentrations of oilseed rape canopy could be monitored using remotely sensed data and the RBF method, especially the GRNN method, is a useful explorative tool for oilseed rape nitrogen concentration monitoring when applied on hyperspectral data.

In this article, based on a biased heat conduction recommendation algorithm (BHC) which considers the heterogeneity of the target objects, we propose a heterogeneous heat conduction algorithm (HHC), by further taking the heterogeneity of the source objects into account. Tested on three real datasets, the Netflix, RYM and MovieLens, the HHC algorithm is found to present better recommendation in both the accuracy and diversity than two benchmark algorithms, i.e., the original BHC and a hybrid algorithm of heat conduction and mass diffusion (HHM), while not requiring any other accessorial information or parameter. Moreover, the HHC algorithm also elevates the recommendation accuracy on cold objects, referring to the so-called cold-start problem. Eigenvalue analyses show that, the HHC algorithm effectively alleviates the recommendation bias towards objects with different level of popularity, which is beneficial to solving the accuracy-diversity dilemma.

This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic value of qHBsAg for hepatic fibrosis in hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-positive HBV carriers. MethodsConsecutive biopsy-proven HBeAg-positive HBV carriers were prospectively recruited in our center from 2009 to 2011 and were randomly divided into training and validation set. Area under receiver-operator curve (AUC) was used to determine the diagnostic accuracy of simple tests for significant fibrosis (Scheuer stage, F2). ResultsOverall, a total of 197 eligible patients (median age 31 years; 149 males) were enrolled. The median qHBsAg was 4.20 (log(10) IU/mL). Significant fibrosis was confirmed in 112 (56.9%) patients. By logistical regression analysis, qHBsAg and -glutamyl transpeptidase were identified as predictors for significant fibrosis in training set (n=124). Thus, qHBsAg index and -glutamyl transpeptidase to qHBsAg ratio (GqHBsR) were selected for the subsequent analysis. In the training set, an AUC of 0.762, 0.826, 0.749, and 0.771 was observed for qHBsAg index, GqHBsR, FIB-4, and aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index, respectively (all P<0.05). GqHBsR yielded a higher AUC than aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index and FIB-4 (both P<0.05). Using the optimal cut-off of 7.78, GqHBsR showed a sensitivity of 78.9% and a specificity of 73.6%. About 80% of liver biopsy could be avoided in the entire cohort. ConclusionsSerum qHBsAg-based simple tests, especially GqHBsR, can accurately and specifically identify significant fibrosis in treatment-naive HBeAg-positive HBV carriers.

This study examines the expression, localization, and potential function of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) during ovulation in women. The dominant follicle of the menstrual cycle was collected at specified times throughout the ovulatory process: pre-, early, late, and postovulatory. For quantitative studies, the follicle was bisected; granulosa and theca cells were separated and collected. For immunohistochemistry (IHC), the intact follicle was embedded and TIMP3 was localized. Additionally, granulosa cells were collected from women undergoing in vitro fertilization and treated with increasing concentrations of recombinant TIMP3, and cell viability was assessed. Real-time PCR for TIMP3 mRNA revealed an increase in TIMP3 mRNA expression in granulosa cells from the early to the late ovulatory stage. Thecal TIMP3 mRNA expression was constitutive across the periovulatory period. TIMP3 protein was localized by IHC to the granulosa and theca cell layers in pre-, early, and late ovulatory follicles as well as to the vascular bed. The staining was most intense in the granulosa and theca cells in the late ovulatory group. Treatment of human granulosa-lutein cells with exogenous recombinant TIMP3 for 24 h decreased cell viability by 60%. Using human follicles collected throughout the periovulatory period of the menstrual cycle, we have demonstrated that TIMP3 mRNA expression increases and that TIMP3 protein is in the appropriate cellular layers to regulate proteolytic remodeling as the follicle progresses toward ovulation. In addition, we have shown that elevated levels of TIMP3 lead to decreased cell viability.

The purpose of this work was to find the optimal combination of influent ammonium (NH4+-N-inf), dissolved oxygen (DO) and the alkalinity/ammonium ratio (Alk/NH4+-N) with respect to the effluent nitrite to ammonium molar ratio and nitrite accumulation ratio. Based on the RSM results, the reduced cubic model and the quadratic model developed for the responses indicated that the optimal conditions were a DO content of 1.1-2.1 mg L-1, an Alk/NH4+-N ratio of 330-5.69 and an NH4+-N-inf content of 608-1039 mg L-1. The results of confirmation trials were close to the predictions of the developed models. Furthermore, three types of alkali were comparatively explored for use in the PN process, and bicarbonate was found to be the best alkalinity source. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Sequence analysis of this esterase subfamily, named the ArmEst subfamily, revealed a unique conserved pattern with a significant variable interior sequence flanked by two symmetric and identical long arm sequences. The two homologous long arm sequences had 100 % sequence identity and symmetry at both ends between the five members of this esterase class, but only 17-58 % identity was shared for the internal sequence. The biochemical properties of two of the ArmEst esterases definitively demonstrated that they are true active esterases rather than pseudogenes. This is the first report presenting an esterase subfamily containing a unique arm sequence, indicating a rare homologous recombination occurring in the coding area of a functional gene to generate their functional diversity.

The disease control is becoming less efficient because of the dispersal of fungicide-resistant strains. However, genome-scale analyses of its resistance mechanism are scarce. In this work, we sequenced the whole genome of the R1 genotype strain Pd01-ZJU and investigated the genes and DNA elements highly associated with drug resistance. Variation in DNA elements related to drug resistance between P.digitatum strains was revealed in both copy number and chromosomal location, indicating that their recent and frequent translocation might have contributed to environmental adaptation. In addition, ABC transporter proteins in Pd01-ZJU were characterized, and the roles of typical subfamilies (ABCG, ABCC, and ABCB) in imazalil resistance were explored using real-time PCR. Seven ABC proteins, including the previously characterized PMR1 and PMR5, were induced by imazalil, which suggests a role in drug resistance. In summary, this work presents genome information of the R1 genotype P.digitatum and systematically investigates DNA elements and ABC proteins associated with imazalil resistance for the first time, which would be indicative for studying resistant mechanisms in other pathogenic fungi.

Therefore, transplantation of Dll-4-overexpressing endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) was hypothesized to be superior to transplantation of EPCs in the treatment of ischemic heart disease. In the current study, EPCs harvested from C57BL/6 mouse bone marrow were infected in vitro with Dll-4 (EPCDll-4+) or Dll-4 knockdown (EPCDll-4-) with recombinant lentiviral vectors and the control cells were non-transfected or transduced with mock vectors (EPCnull). Eight-week-old C57BL/6 mice underwent ligation of the left anterior descending artery to establish a myocardial infarction (MI) model. The ligated animals were randomly divided into 5 groups, which, following one week, were intravenously injected with EPCs, EPCnull, EPCDll-4+, EPCDll-4- or medium. Two weeks later, echocardiographic assessment, western blotting, fluorescent microsphere and histological studies were performed. The results demonstrated that the number of mature vessels and blood flow in ischemic myocardium were increased in the EPCDll-4+ group, but were markedly decreased in the EPCDll-4- group compared with the control groups. The expression levels of Dll-4, hairy/enhancer of split (Hes)-related protein 1 (Hey-1), phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p70S6 kinase (p70S6K) were significantly increased in the EPCDll-4+ group, while they were markedly decreased in the EPCDll-4- group. Furthermore, for EPCDll-4+-treated animals, an enhanced cardiac function was observed as assessed by echocardiography. Thus, the transplantation of Dll-4-overexpressing EPCs stimulates neovascularization effectively, increases the blood flow to the ischemic zone and improves cardiac function. These effects may be due to the activation of Notch/Hey-1/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathways, which are initiated by Dll-4.

The energy level structures for all possible isomers are reported and compared with those of C-60, C-70 and PC61BM. The attachment of the side chains can raise the LUMO energies and decrease the HOMO-LUMO gaps, and thus helps to increase the power-conversion efficiency of bulk heterojunction solar cells. In the PES studies, we prepared IC(60)BA and PC71BM films on Si:H(111) substrates to construct adsorbate/substrate interfaces describable with the integer charge-transfer (ICT) model. Successful measurements then revealed that one of the most important material properties for an electron acceptor, the energy of the negative integer charge-transfer state (EICT-), is 4.31 eV below the vacuum level for PC71BM. The EICT- of IC(60)BA is smaller than 4.14 eV.

Effective separation of inorganic mercury (Hg2+), methylmercury (MeHg), ethylmercury (EtHg) and phenylmercury (PhHg) within 2-2.5 min was achieved on two consecutive 12.5-mm strong cation exchange guard columns with 2.0 mM L-cysteine or thiourea (pH 2.0) as the mobile phase. This separation met the requirements of green analytical chemistry such as the prevention of toxic waste, safer HPLC mobile phases, and short separation times to reduce operating costs. The detection limits for Hg2+, MeHg, EtHg and PhHg were 0.019, 0.027, 0.031 and 0.022 mu g L-1, each, and the repeatabilities of peak height and peak area (5.0 mu g L-1 for each Hg species) were all lower than 3%. Contents of Hg species and total mercury in certified reference materials of seawater (GBW(E) 080042) and fish tissue (GBW 10029) were in good accordance with the certified values, and satisfactory recoveries (96-102% for GBW(E) 080042 and 94-101% for GBW 10029) validated the developed method. The developed method was applied for the speciation of mercury in five seawater sample and five marine fish samples. The concentrations of mercury species in all analyzed fish samples did not exceed the permissible levels of the National Standard of China. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results indicated that milk microspheres with double layer structure could improve the stability of L. bulgaricus in simulated gastro-intestinal conditions. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus did not change after 2 h incubation in simulated gastric fluid (SGF) pH 2.5. In SGF pH 2.0, the viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus could be preserved more than 8 Log CFU/g after 2 h incubation. In 2 g/100 mL bile salt solution, encapsulated L. bulgaricus only suffered I Log CFU/g viability reduction after 1 h treatment, and 1.5 Log CFU/g viability reductions after 2 h treatment. Encapsulation could also improve the storage stability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus. The viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus was kept constant after 1 month storage at 4 degrees C. Milk microspheres had high release rate for L. bulgaricus in simulated intestine fluid (SIP), which could be totally released in 45 min. This study presents a good encapsulation carrier which protects probiotic L. bulgaricus during exposure to adverse environment conditions. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

J	Yang, CP; Su, QP; Nori, F				Yang, Chui-Ping; Su, Qi-Ping; Nori, Franco			Entanglement generation and quantum information transfer between spatially-separated qubits in different cavities	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTING QUBIT; STATES; PHOTON; NODES	The generation and control of quantum states of spatially-separated qubits distributed in different cavities constitute fundamental tasks in cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED). An interesting question in this context is how to prepare entanglement and realize quantum information transfer between qubits located at different cavities, which are important in large-scale quantum information processing. In this paper, we consider a physical system consisting of two cavities and three qubits. Two of the qubits are placed in two different cavities while the remaining one acts as a coupler, which is used to connect the two cavities. We propose an approach for generating quantum entanglement and implementing quantum information transfer between the two spatially-separated inter-cavity qubits. The quantum operations involved in this proposal are performed by a virtual photon process; thus the cavity decay is greatly suppressed during operations. In addition, to complete these tasks, only one coupler qubit and one operation step are needed. Moreover, there is no need to apply classical pulses, so that the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation procedure is greatly simplified. Finally, our numerical results illustrate that high-fidelity implementation of this proposal using superconducting phase qubits and one-dimensional transmission line resonators is feasible for current circuit QED implementations. This proposal can also be applied to other types of superconducting qubits, including flux and charge qubits.

It is demonstrated that due to the collision, the scaling symmetry of the system is destroyed. By means of the classical Lie group approach, two types of exact similarity waves are obtained which show three important features. First, various waves can be constructed from these solutions, such as solitary waves, shock waves and periodic waves. Second, these waves may have shears that are time-dependent, linear and nonlinear. Third, the electrostatic potential and the parallel electron velocity possess more freedoms in the sense that they can have either same or different wave forms. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

This paper addresses the problem of a reset state observer (RSO)-based control (RSOC) for linear systems using quantized measurements. According to the characteristic of the logarithmic quantizer, an RSOC is presented based on the standard one to suppress sensor quantization effects. By using the Lyapunov approach, the closed-loop system is still asymptotically stable when the reset technique is introduced. The observer and controller gains of the closed-loop systems are obtained via solving linear matrix inequalities. At last, a numerical example is given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed results.

J	Chen, DB; Gao, H; Lu, LY; Zhou, T				Chen, Duan-Bing; Gao, Hui; Lu, Linyuan; Zhou, Tao			Identifying Influential Nodes in Large-Scale Directed Networks: The Role of Clustering	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; LINK PREDICTION; CENTRALITY; DYNAMICS	Identifying influential nodes in very large-scale directed networks is a big challenge relevant to disparate applications, such as accelerating information propagation, controlling rumors and diseases, designing search engines, and understanding hierarchical organization of social and biological networks. Known methods range from node centralities, such as degree, closeness and betweenness, to diffusion-based processes, like PageRank and LeaderRank. Some of these methods already take into account the influences of a node's neighbors but do not directly make use of the interactions among it's neighbors. Local clustering is known to have negative impacts on the information spreading. We further show empirically that it also plays a negative role in generating local connections. Inspired by these facts, we propose a local ranking algorithm named ClusterRank, which takes into account not only the number of neighbors and the neighbors' influences, but also the clustering coefficient. Subject to the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) spreading model with constant infectivity, experimental results on two directed networks, a social network extracted from delicious.com and a large-scale short-message communication network, demonstrate that the ClusterRank outperforms some benchmark algorithms such as PageRank and LeaderRank. Furthermore, ClusterRank can also be applied to undirected networks where the superiority of ClusterRank is significant compared with degree centrality and k-core decomposition. In addition, ClusterRank, only making use of local information, is much more efficient than global methods: It takes only 191 seconds for a network with about 107 nodes, more than 15 times faster than PageRank.

This study aims to investigate the alterations of self-reference in mTLE using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Fifty patients with unilateral mTLE (26 left- and 24 right-sided mTLE) were recruited in the present study. Traditional task paradigm of internally-cued condition vs. externally-cued condition was employed to induce self-referential activation. FMRI activation in each group of patients was compared with that of 30 healthy controls. Moreover, fMRI responses in the dorsal mesial prefrontal cortex were specifically addressed by correlating with behavioral data of reaction times and clinical data of epilepsy duration, respectively. Compared with the healthy controls, both two groups of patients showed decreased behavioral performance (reaction times) and decreased fMRI activation of self-reference in the anterior and posterior cortical midline structures. Moreover, fMRI activation was found to be negatively correlated with behavioral performance and epilepsy duration. The present findings implicate functional impairment of self-reference caused by epilepsy in mTLE. This study provided imaging evidence for functional impairments of self-referential processing and brain default-mode function in mTLE. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Through the steam ironing process, the superhydrophobicity of the SCFs will be regenerated even after the yarns are ruptured during the abrasion test under a load pressure of 44.8 kPa. SCFs made from LMA grafted cotton fabric can ultimately withstand at least 24,000 cycles of abrasion with periodic steam ironing. The FT-IR microscope results show that the migration of the polymethacrylates graft chains from the interior to the surface is responsible for the self-healing effect.

The formulation is essentially non-Markovian and incorporates properly the interlay of the multi-tunneling processes and many-body correlations. We apply this approach to the challenging none quilibrium Kondo system and predict a profound nonequilibriurn Kondo signature in the shot noise spectrum. The proposed n-SCBA-ME scheme goes completely beyond the scope of the Born-Markovian master equation approach, in the sense of being applicable to the shot noise of transport under small bias voltage, in non-Markovian regime, and with strong Coulomb correlations as favorably demonstrated in the none quilibrium Kondo system.

Standardizing the intrinsic brain: Towards robust measurement of inter-individual variation in 1000 functional connectomes	NEUROIMAGE			English	Article						Functional connectomics; Standardization; Test-retest reliability; Resting-state fMRI; Data aggregation	RESTING-STATE FMRI; LOW-FREQUENCY FLUCTUATION; DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; GLOBAL SIGNAL; MULTICENTER FMRI; CONNECTIVITY MRI; HEAD MOTION; IMPACT; NOISE; ANTICORRELATIONS	As researchers increase their efforts to characterize variations in the functional connectome across studies and individuals, concerns about the many sources of nuisance variation present and their impact on resting state fMRI (R-fMRI) measures continue to grow. Although substantial within-site variation can exist efforts to aggregate data across multiple sites such as the 1000 Functional Connectomes Project (FCP) and International Neuroimaging Data-sharing Initiative (INDI) datasets amplify these concerns. The present work draws upon standardization approaches commonly used in the microarray gene expression literature, and to a lesser extent recent imaging studies, and compares them with respect to their impact on relationships between common R-fMRI measures and nuisance variables (e.g., imaging site, motion), as well as phenotypic variables of interest (age, sex). Standardization approaches differed with regard to whether they were applied post-hoc vs. during pre-processing, and at the individual vs. group level; additionally they varied in whether they addressed additive effects vs. additive + multiplicative effects, and were parametric vs. non-parametric. While all standardization approaches were effective at reducing undesirable relationships with nuisance variables, post-hoc approaches were generally more effective than global signal regression (GSR). Across approaches, correction for additive effects (global mean) appeared to be more important than for multiplicative effects (global SD) for all R-fMRI measures, with the exception of amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF). Group-level post-hoc standardizations for mean-centering and variance-standardization were found to be advantageous in their ability to avoid the introduction of artifactual relationships with standardization parameters; though results between individual and group-level post-hoc approaches were highly similar overall. While post-hoc standardization procedures drastically increased test-retest (TRT) reliability for ALFF, modest reductions were observed for other measures after post-hoc standardizations a phenomena likely attributable to the separation of voxel-wise from global differences among subjects (global mean and SD demonstrated moderate TRT reliability for these measures). Finally, the present work calls into question previous observations of increased anatomical specificity for GSR over mean centering, and draws attention to the near equivalence of global and gray matter signal regression.

It was found that the enantioselective vinylogous Mannich-type reactions of trimethylsiloxyfuran with aldimines are catalyzed efficiently by silver(I) complexes of the Ar-BINMOL-derived chiral monophosphine. This procedure displays wide aldimine versatility, excellent yields (up to 99% isolated yields), moderate to good enantioselectivity (up to 78%ee) and exceptional diastereoselectivity (>99:1 dr) in most cases examined. The molecular structure of silver-monophosphine complex was confirmed by X-ray analysis and revealed that the benzyl group on chiral monophosphine provided dual function with weak silver-pi/pi-pi stacking and steric repulsion to favour the diastereoselective Re-nucleophilic addition of siloxyfuran to imine.

Understanding structure and function of this community is important for the ecological conservation, but has seldom been investigated. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, a total of 324 quadrats located on the three main types of Mongolian steppes were surveyed. Early-season perennial forbs (37% of total importance value), late-season annual forbs (33%) and late-season perennial forbs (44%) were dominant in meadow, typical and desert steppes, respectively. Species richness, diversity and plant functional type (PFT) richness decreased from the meadow, via typical to desert steppes, but evenness increased; PFT diversity in the desert and meadow steppes was higher than that in typical steppe. However, above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) was far lower in desert steppe than in the other two steppes. In addition, the slope of the relationship between species richness and PFT richness increased from the meadow, via typical to desert steppes. Similarly, with an increase in species diversity, PFT diversity increased more quickly in both the desert and typical steppes than that in meadow steppe. Random resampling suggested that this coordination was partly due to a sampling effect of diversity. Conclusions/Significance: These results indicate that desert steppe should be strictly protected because of its limited functional redundancy, which its ecological functioning is sensitive to species loss. In contrast, despite high potential forage production shared by the meadow and typical steppes, management of these two types of steppes should be different: meadow steppe should be preserved due to its higher conservation value characterized by more species redundancy and higher spatial heterogeneity, while typical steppe could be utilized moderately because its dominant grass genus Stipa is resistant to herbivory and drought.

Salinity stress triggers increases in cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+](i)) via Ca2+ influx across the plasma membrane. Salinity stress, as well as other stresses, induces the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). It is well established that ROS also triggers increases in [Ca2+](i). However, the relationship and interaction between salinity stress-induced [Ca2+](i) increases and ROS-induced [Ca2+](i) increases remain poorly understood. Using an aequorin-based Ca2+ imaging assay we have analyzed [Ca2+](i) changes in response to NaCl and H2O2 treatments in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that NaCl and H2O2 together induced larger increases in [Ca2+](i) in Arabidopsis seedlings than either NaCl or H2O2 alone, suggesting an additive effect on [Ca2+](i) increases. Following a pretreatment with either NaCl or H2O2, the subsequent elevation of [Ca2+](i) in response to a second treatment with either NaCl or H2O2 was significantly reduced. Furthermore, the NaCl pre-treatment suppressed the elevation of [Ca2+](i) seen with a second NaCl treatment more than that seen with a second treatment of H2O2. A similar response was seen when the initial treatment was with H2O2; subsequent addition of H2O2 led to less of an increase in [Ca2+](i) than did addition of NaCl. These results imply that NaCl-gated Ca2+ channels and H2O2-gated Ca2+ channels may differ, and also suggest that NaCl-and H2O2-evoked [Ca2+](i) may reduce the potency of both NaCl and H2O2 in triggering [Ca2+](i) increases, highlighting a feedback mechanism. Alternatively, NaCl and H2O2 may activate the same Ca2+ permeable channel, which is expressed in different types of cells and/or activated via different signaling pathways.

However, lack of correspondence in DFI also leads to ineffective control over the morphing process. In particular, unless the user specifies a dense set of landmarks, it is not even possible to measure the distortion of intermediate shapes during interpolation, let alone control it. To remedy such issues, we introduce an approach for establishing correspondence between the interior of two arbitrary objects, formulated as an optimal mass transport problem with a sparse set of landmarks. This correspondence enables us to compute non-rigid warping functions that better align the source and target objects as well as to incorporate local rigidity constraints to perform as-rigid-as?possible DFI. We demonstrate how our approach helps achieve flexible morphing results with a small number of landmarks.

Accumulating evidence suggests the protective role of Rho kinase inhibitors in endothelial dysfunction via modulating eNOS activity and NO production. However, the role of Rho kinase in diabetes-related endothelial dysfunction in kidney vasculature and the relevant mechanisms remain unknown. We assessed whether pharmacological inhibition of Rho kinase attenuates endothelial dysfunction in intrarenal arteries from type 1 diabetic rats. Fasudil, a Rho kinase inhibitor effectively decreased the phosphorylated level of MYPT1 without affecting the expression of ROCKs in the kidney. Fasudil treatment showed no improvement in diabetes-related abnormality in metabolic indices, but it significantly ameliorated endothelial dysfunction in intrarenal arteries and lessened the mesangial matrix expansion in the kidney cortex. Mechanistically, superoxide production in the intrarenal artery and NOX4 member of NADPH oxidase in the renal cortex that contribute to diabetic nephropathy were also prevented by the Rho kinase inhibitor. In conclusion, the present results indicate that Rho kinase is involved in endothelial dysfunction in type 1 diabetes via enhancement of oxidative stress and provides new evidence for Rho kinase inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy.

First, the experimental setup is constructed by using sensing nanomaterials, a heating plate, a pneumatic pump, a gas flow meter, a digital temperature device, a camera and a BPCL Ultra Weak Chemiluminescence Analyzer. Then, unique CTL patterns for the four types of harmful gas are obtained from the sensor array. The harmful gases are successful recognized by the PCA method. The optimal conditions are also investigated. Finally, experimental results show high sensitivity, long-term stability and good linearity of the sensor array, which combined with simplicity, make our system a promising application in this field.

We study analytically the dynamics of authors' hyper-degree using mean-field approach. Results of both theoretical and numerical studies indicate that such a hyper-degree distribution follows a power-law decay, with the exponent gamma = 1 + L/M, where L/M suggests the author growth rate of an evolving scientific network. In addition, empirical studies on ten-year journal data of Science China and Acta Physica Sinica from 2003 to 2012, shows that the present model can find good agreement with the empirical data. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the structure and scientific collaboration networks.

By adding 10 mL highly active Anammox sludge every 2 days, the nitrogen removal rate (NRR) at 9.1 degrees C increased to 6.6 kg m(-3) d(-1), almost 20% higher than that of R1 (acclimation). The effect of GB addition on Anammox was varied. Operation using either strategy changed the sludge characteristics. Low biomasses of 12.90 and 9.74 g VSS L-1 were detected in R1 and R2, respectively, after whole investigation, whereas R3 had a biomass of 22.36 g VSS L-1.

REG gamma, a proteasome activator known to promote p53/p21/p16 degradation, is often overexpressed in cancer cells. Here we show that p53/TGF-beta signalling inhibits the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway by repressing REG gamma expression. Smad3 and p53 interact on the REG gamma promoter via the p53RE/SBE region. Conversely, mutant p53 binds to the REG gamma promoter and recruits p300. Importantly, mutant p53 prevents Smad3/N-CoR complex formation on the REG gamma promoter, which enhances the activity of the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway and contributes to mutant p53 gain of function. Depletion of REG gamma alters the cellular response to p53/TGF-beta signalling in drug resistance, proliferation, cell cycle progression and proteasome activity. Moreover, p53 mutations show a positive correlation with REG gamma expression in cancer samples. These findings suggest that targeting REG gamma-20S proteasome for cancer therapy may be applicable to human tumours with abnormal p53/Smad protein status. Furthermore, this study demonstrates a link between p53/TGF-beta signalling and the REG gamma-20S proteasome pathway, and provides insight into the REG gamma/p53 feedback loop.

How is a top priority canopy species for conservation in Hainan due to its high risk of extinction. To investigate human impacts on genetic diversity and differentiation on Madhuca hainanensis, we studied the genetic variability and differentiation of 112 individuals from 6 natural wild populations in three regions and different protected areas on Hainan Island, with 15 selected inter-simple sequence repeat (ISSR) markers. High levels of genetic diversity within species (PPB = 96.9%, I = 0.4914, h = 0.3261), while accordingly low levels within-population diversity (PPB = 65.8%, I = 0.3333, h = 0.2206) were detected. Genetic diversity of M. hainanensis mainly exists within populations (G(ST) = 0.1975). The genetic diversity of protected group was higher than that of un-protected group. The AMOVA results revealed that there was a significant differentiation among regions and among protected and unprotected groups. The Mantel test demonstrated that there was no significant correlation between pair-wise population PhiPT matrix and geographic distance matrix. All above indicated that the genetic differentiation among regions might be due to the serious human activity, but not geographic isolation. We recommend that strict in-situ conservation efforts should be implemented quickly for future management to prevent further deforestation. Crown Copyright (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The obtained results suggest that the enrichment culture produced by the addition of SRpf (enrichment culture treatment group, ECT) enhanced the biphenyl degradation efficiency, cell growth and bacterial diversity significantly. Biphenyl at concentration of 1500 mg/L was almost completely degraded in 24 h using SRpf at a dosage of 15% (v/v). Six strains unique to the ECT were isolated in pure cultures. This study provides a new insight into bacterial degradation of biphenyl for PCBs-bioremediation, and could be developed as a novel efficient method for obtaining highly desirable pollutant-degrading microorganisms.
