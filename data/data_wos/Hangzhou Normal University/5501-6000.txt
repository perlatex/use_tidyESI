NEUROIMAGE-CLINICAL			English	Article						Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); Intraoperative magnetic resonance imaging; Tumor; Awake surgery; Intraoperative functional mapping; Surgical planning	BRAIN SHIFT; LOW-FIELD; PRELIMINARY EXPERIENCE; GLIOMA REMOVAL; RESONANCE; RESECTION; NEURONAVIGATION; DEFORMATION; COMPENSATION; LANGUAGE	As a promising noninvasive imaging technique, functional MRI (fMRI) has been extensively adopted as a functional localization procedure for surgical planning. However, the information provided by preoperative fMRI (pre-fMRI) is hampered by the brain deformation that is secondary to surgical procedures. Therefore, intraoperative fMRI (i-fMRI) becomes a potential alternative that can compensate for brain shifts by updating the functional localization information during craniotomy. However, previous i-fMRI studies required that patients be under general anesthesia, preventing the wider application of such a technique as the patients cannot perform tasks unless they are awake. In this study, we propose a new technique that combines awake surgery and i-fMRI, named "awake" i-fMRI (ai-fMRI). We introduced ai-fMRI to the real-time localization of sensorimotor areas during awake craniotomy in seven patients. The results showed that ai-fMRI could successfully detect activations in the bilateral primary sensorimotor areas and supplementary motor areas for all patients, indicating the feasibility of this technique in eloquent area localization. The reliability of ai-fMRI was further validated using intraoperative stimulation mapping (ISM) in two of the seven patients. Comparisons between the pre-fMRI-derived localization result and the ai-fMRI derived result showed that the former was subject to a heavy brain shift and led to incorrect localization, while the latter solved that problem. Additionally, the approaches for the acquisition and processing of the ai-fMRI data were fully illustrated and described. Some practical issues on employing ai-fMRI in awake craniotomy were systemically discussed, and guidelines were provided. (C) 2012 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, it remains to be elucidated how ToMV MP plays such diverse roles in plants. Here, we show that ToMV MP interacts with the Rubisco small subunit (RbCS)of Nicotiana benthamiana in vitro and in vivo. In susceptible N. benthamiana plants, silencing of NbRbCS enabled ToMV to induce necrosis in inoculated leaves, thus enhancing virus local infectivity. However, the development of systemic viral symptoms was delayed. In transgenic N. benthamiana plants harboring Tobacco mosaic virus resistance-2(2) (Tm-2(2)), which mediates extreme resistance to ToMV, silencing of NbRbCS compromised Tm-2(2)-dependent resistance. ToMV was able to establish efficient local infection but was not able to move systemically. These findings suggest that NbRbCS plays a vital role in tobamovirus movement and plant antiviral defenses.

The crystalline structures, miscibility, and physical properties of PVDF/IL blends were investigated systematically. It was found that the incorporation of IL into the PVDF leads to drastically increased g crystal forms of PVDF by the interaction between the >CF2 and cationic ions. Moreover, IL is fully miscible with PVDF with the interaction parameter (chi(12)) of -2.84 calculated by the revised Nishi-Wang equation due to the drastic equilibrium melting temperature depression. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) results indicate that the IL molecules are inserted into the gallery of PVDF lamellae. A small amount of IL induces the appearance of the crystal-amorphous interface relaxation of PVDF, originating from the enrichment of IL distribution near the crystal-amorphous interface. The obtained PVDF/IL blends exhibit excellent mechanical performance with significantly increased ductility and good optical transmittance. In addition, the incorporation of IL into PVDF enhances the electrical conductivity of PVDF films greatly. Therefore, novel PVDF films with high transparency, excellent antistatic properties, and a highly polar crystal form fraction were successfully achieved.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that occur at miRNA-related regions may cause serious phenotype changes. To gain new insights into the evolution of miRNAs after SNP variation, we performed a genome-wide scan of miRNA-related SNPs, and analyzed their effects on the stability of miRNAs structure and the alteration of target spectrum in rice. Results: We find that the SNP density in pre-miRNAs is significantly higher than that in the flanking regions, owing to the rapid evolution of a large number of species-specific miRNAs in rice. In contrast, it is obvious that deeply conserved miRNAs are under strong purifying selection during evolution. In most cases, the SNPs in stem regions may result in the miRNA hairpin structures changing from stable to unstable status; And SNPs in mature miRNAs have great potential to have either newly created or disrupted the miRNA-target interactions. However, the total number of gained targets is over 2.5 times greater than that are lost after mutation. Notably, 12 putative domestication-related miRNAs have been identified, where the SNP density is significantly lower. Conclusions: The present study provides the first outline of SNP variations occurred in rice pre-miRNAs at the whole genome-wide level. These analyses may deepen our understanding on the effects of SNPs on the evolution of miRNAs in the rice genome.

In contrast to the previously reported CaBe2Ge2-type CeNi2As2, the ThCr2Si2-type CeNi2As2 is a highly anisotropic uniaxial antiferromagnet with the transition temperature T-N = 4.8 K. A magnetic-field-induced spin-flop transition was seen below T-N when the applied B is parallel to the c axis, the magnetic easy axis, together with a huge frustration parameter f = theta(W)/T-N. A pronounced Schottky-type anomaly in specific heat was also found around 160 K, which could be attributed to the crystalline electric field effect with the excitation energies being fitted to Delta(1) = 325 K and Delta(2) = 520 K, respectively. Moreover, the in-plane resistivity anisotropy and low-temperature x-ray diffractions suggest that this compound is a rare example exhibiting a possible structure distortion induced by the 4f-electron magnetic frustration.

The particle size can be systematically controlled by utilizing the "container effect" during the synthesis of mesoporous In2O3 intermediate. With the increase of Sn doping concentration, the electrical resistivity first decreases and then increases. The minimum resistivity value is 0.34 Omega cm for mesoporous ITO sample with 10 mol% of Sn doping concentration. We also discussed the effect of calcinations atmosphere and temperature on the crystallinity, mesoporous regularity and conducting properties in detail. The mesoporous ITO products prepared in this work possess high thermal stability up to 700 degrees C and may be used as excellent optoelectronic materials at elevated temperature without any detectable collapse in porosity.

J	Xu, XQ; Han, JH				Xu, Xiao-Qiang; Han, Jung Hoon			Skyrmion dynamics and disintegration in a spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article								Dynamics of skyrmionic spin texture in the spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate is examined by analytical and numerical means. We show the skyrmion (coreless vortex) to be inherently unstable in the sense that the state initially prepared purely within the antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) order parameter manifold inevitably evolves into a mixture of both. The vorticity-dependent drift in the presence of the trapping potential also contributes to the disintegration of the initial spin texture manifold. We argue that the notion of a skyrmion as a topologically protected entity becomes ill defined during the dynamical evolution process.

J	Cui, AX; Zhang, ZK; Tang, M; Hui, PM; Fu, Y				Cui, Ai-Xiang; Zhang, Zi-Ke; Tang, Ming; Hui, Pak Ming; Fu, Yan			Emergence of Scale-Free Close-Knit Friendship Structure in Online Social Networks	PLOS ONE			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; EVOLUTION; MOTIFS; DISTRIBUTIONS; DYNAMICS; TIME	Although the structural properties of online social networks have attracted much attention, the properties of the close-knit friendship structures remain an important question. Here, we mainly focus on how these mesoscale structures are affected by the local and global structural properties. Analyzing the data of four large-scale online social networks reveals several common structural properties. It is found that not only the local structures given by the indegree, outdegree, and reciprocal degree distributions follow a similar scaling behavior, the mesoscale structures represented by the distributions of close-knit friendship structures also exhibit a similar scaling law. The degree correlation is very weak over a wide range of the degrees. We propose a simple directed network model that captures the observed properties. The model incorporates two mechanisms: reciprocation and preferential attachment. Through rate equation analysis of our model, the local-scale and mesoscale structural properties are derived. In the local-scale, the same scaling behavior of indegree and outdegree distributions stems from indegree and outdegree of nodes both growing as the same function of the introduction time, and the reciprocal degree distribution also shows the same power-law due to the linear relationship between the reciprocal degree and in/outdegree of nodes. In the mesoscale, the distributions of four closed triples representing close-knit friendship structures are found to exhibit identical power-laws, a behavior attributed to the negligible degree correlations. Intriguingly, all the power-law exponents of the distributions in the local-scale and mesoscale depend only on one global parameter, the mean in/outdegree, while both the mean in/outdegree and the reciprocity together determine the ratio of the reciprocal degree of a node to its in/outdegree. Structural properties of numerical simulated networks are analyzed and compared with each of the four real networks. This work helps understand the interplay between structures on different scales in online social networks.

A few recent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) studies indicate that the RS-fMRI could map off-line memory consolidation effects. However, the gene effects on memory consolidation process remain largely unknown. Here we collected two RS-fMRI sessions, one before and another after an episodic memory encoding task, from two groups of healthy young adults, one with apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 2/epsilon 3 and the other with APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4. The ratio of regional homogeneity (ReHo), a measure of local synchronization of spontaneous RS-fMRI signal, of the two sessions was used as an index of memory-consolidation. APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4 group showed greater ReHo ratio within the medial temporal lobe (MTL). The ReHo ratio in MTL was significantly correlated with the recognition memory performance in the APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4 group but not in epsilon 2/epsilon 3 group. Additionally, APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4 group showed lower ReHo ratio in the occipital and parietal picture-encoding areas. Our results indicate that APOE epsilon 3/epsilon 4 group may have a different off-line memory consolidation process compared to epsilon 2/epsilon 3 group. These results may help generate future hypotheses that the off-line memory consolidation might be impaired in Alzheimer's disease.

Myeloperoxidase has been extensively implicated as a key mediator of inflammatory and redox-dependent processes in atherosclerosis. However, the effect of synthetic myeloperoxidase inhibitors on atherosclerosis has been insufficiently studied. In this study, ApoE (-/-) mice were randomized to low-and high-dose INV-315 groups for 16 weeks on high-fat diet. INV-315 resulted in reduced plaque burden and improved endothelial function in response to acetylcholine. These effects occurred without adverse events or changes in body weight or blood pressure. INV-315 treatment resulted in a decrease in iNOS gene expression, superoxide production and nitrotyrosine content in the aorta. Circulating IL-6 and inflammatory CD11b(+)/Ly6G(low)/7/4(hi) monocytes were significantly decreased in response to INV-315 treatment. Acute pretreatment with INV-315 blocked TNF alpha-mediated leukocyte adhesion in cremasteric venules and inhibited myeloperoxidase activity. Cholesterol efflux was significantly increased by high-dose INV-315 via ex-vivo reverse cholesterol transport assays. Our results suggest that myeloperoxidase inhibition may exert anti-atherosclerotic effects via inhibition of oxidative stress and enhancement of cholesterol efflux. These findings demonstrate a role for pharmacologic modulation of myeloperoxidase in atherosclerosis.

Recently, a new class of propeller-like luminogenic molecules with aggregation-induced emission (AIE) characteristics has drawn increasing research interest. Among them, tetraphenylethene (TPE) is an archetypal luminogen with a simple molecule structure but shows a splendid AIE effect. Utilizing TPE as a building block, an effective strategy to create efficient solid-state emitters is developed. In this feature article, we review mainly our recent work on the construction of luminogenic materials from TPE and present their applications in organic light-emitting diodes. The applicability of the synthetic strategy and the utility of the resulting materials are demonstrated.	[Lam, Jacky W.

Malte			Pressure- and Composition-Induced Structural Quantum Phase Transition in the Cubic Superconductor (Sr, Ca)(3)Ir4Sn13	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							STATE; DISTORTION; CRYSTAL	We show that the quasi-skutterudite superconductor Sr3Ir4Sn13 undergoes a structural transition from a simple cubic parent structure, the I phase, to a superlattice variant, the I' phase, which has a lattice parameter twice that of the high temperature phase. We argue that the superlattice distortion is associated with a charge density wave transition of the conduction electron system and demonstrate that the superlattice transition temperature T* can be suppressed to zero by combining chemical and physical pressure. This enables the first comprehensive investigation of a superlattice quantum phase transition and its interplay with superconductivity in a cubic charge density wave system.

The resulting double manifold carries a metric of positive scalar curvature and an isoparametric foliation as well. To investigate the topology of the double manifolds, we use K-theory and the representation of the Clifford algebra for the FKM-type, and determine completely the isotropy subgroups of singular orbits for homogeneous case.

The joint toxicity of OTC and copper (II) on the Anammox mixed culture was antagonistic, whereas the interaction between OTC and S2- and between phenol and S2- was generally synergistic. The joint toxicity of phenol and copper (II) was dependent on the level of phenol: the joint toxicity was antagonistic at a high phenol level of 300 mg L-1, whereas the joint toxicity was synergistic at a low phenol level of 75 mg L-1. The joint toxic effect of OTC, copper (II) and NO2--N on the Anammox activity can be ranked in the following order: NO2--N > copper (II) > OTC. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, ZM; Zhang, ZK; Zhou, T				Yang, Zimo; Zhang, Zi-Ke; Zhou, Tao			Anchoring bias in online voting	EPL			English	Article							DISTRIBUTIONS; TAILS	Voting online with explicit ratings could largely reflect people's preferences and objects' qualities, but ratings are always irrational, because they may be affected by many unpredictable factors like mood, weather and other people's votes. By analyzing two real systems, this paper reveals a systematic bias embedding in the individual decision-making processes, namely people tend to give a low rating after a low rating, as well as a high rating following a high rating. This so-called anchoring bias is validated via extensive comparisons with null models, and numerically speaking, the extent of bias decays with voting interval in a logarithmic form. Our findings could be applied in the design of recommender systems and considered as important complementary materials to previous knowledge about anchoring effects on financial trades, performance judgments, auctions, and so on.

However, these associations are only the superficial traits of the 18th century poetry. Read positively, the 18th century poetry expresses lovely passions, but between the lines there are still traces of negative sentimets which stir up the reader's sentimentality. The present author argues that the reason why the mainstream of the 18th century is regarded as sentimental is that it is imbued with sentimental traits that can touch the innermost part of the reader's soul, that is, the solitude, sadness and anxiety a person experiences when he is trapped in a particular situation.

In this paper, we show that Holbl et al.'s security enhancement is still vulnerable to the smart card lost attacks. In addition, their scheme cannot resist impersonation attacks and parallel session attacks. Seeing that the existing mutual authentication schemes using smart cards are almost vulnerable to the smart card lost attacks, we further propose a new one-time two-factor mutual authentication and key agreement scheme to eliminate these weaknesses.

Telomere shortening is associated with reduced duodenal HCO3- secretory but normal gastric acid secretory capacity in aging mice. Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol 303: G1312-G1321, 2012. First published September 27, 2012; doi: 10.1152/ajpgi.00035.2012.-The incidence of duodenal ulcer, especially Helicobacter pylori-negative duodenal ulcer, strongly increases with age. In humans, telomere length shortening is considered to be one critical factor in cellular senescence and organ survival. In this study, we compared basal and stimulated gastric acid and duodenal HCO3- secretory rates in aged late-generation (G(3)) telomerase-deficient (mTERC(-/-)) mice, which are characterized by severe telomere dysfunction due to the inability to elongate telomeres during cell division. We found that basal and forskolin-timulated HCO3- secretion and short-circuit current (I-sc) in isolated duodenal mucosa of G(3) mTERC(-/-) mice were markedly reduced compared with age-matched wild-type mice. In contrast, basal and forskolin-stimulated acid secretory rates in isolated G(3) mTERC(-/-) gastric mucosa were not significantly altered. Correspondingly, duodenal mucosa of G(3) mTERC(-/-) mice showed slimming and shortening of villi, whereas gastric mucosal histology was not significantly altered. However, the ratios of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) and solute-linked carrier 26 gene family (Slc26a6) mRNA expression in relation to cytokeratin-18 were not altered in duodenal mucosa. The further knockout of p21, which is a downstream effector of telomere shortening-induced senescence, rescued villus atrophy of duodenal mucosa, and basal and forskolin-timulated duodenal HCO3- secretion and I-sc in mTERC(-/-) p21(-/-) double-knockout mice were not different from wild-type controls. In conclusion, genetic ablation of telomerase resulted in p21-dependent duodenal mucosal atrophy and reduced duodenal HCO3- secretory capacity, whereas gastric morphology and acid secretory function were preserved. This suggests that telomere shortening during aging may result in an imbalance between aggressive and protective secretions against duodenal mucosa and thus predispose to ulcer formation.

This unique process, employing the MsCl/NaN3 and Zn/NH4Cl system, overcomes many pitfalls of the literature reported processes, which mostly use chromatographic purification and catalytic hydrogenation with Pd/C. In addition, this novel process overcomes the safety concern with handling amide azide (8), as demonstrated by the results of the drop weight test and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). This process has been successfully scaled-up to prepare several multikilogram batches of the target compound with overall yields of 80%, which is 15 times higher than those of reported procedures.

Understanding the heat stress-related mechanisms in crops and classifying heat stress-related genes can increase our knowledge in heat-resistant molecular biology and propel developments in molecular design breeding, which can help rice cope with unfavorable temperatures. In this study, we carried out a physiological analysis of rice plants after heat stress. The results show a dramatic increase in malondialdehyde contents and SOD activities. We successfully isolated 11 heat-related rice genes with known function annotation through DNSH, which is an improved SSH method for screening long cDNA fragments. The reanalysis of microarray data from public database revealed that all these genes displayed various expression patterns after heat stress, drought, cold and salt. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR was also performed to validate the expression of these genes after heat stress. The expressions in 10 genes were all significantly changed except for contig 77, which is a CBL-interacting protein kinase. Several reports have been published about the members of the same gene family. (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier Masson SAS.

A questionnaire was designed based on interviews with 140 people and a pretest with a sample of 419 participants. A total of 628 participants were involved in the formal questionnaire survey. Results indicated that social supports had a dual effect: Positive supports were indirectly related to career choice consideration through the mediation of career self-efficacy, whereas negative supports were related to career choice consideration directly. Implications for future research and the development of a career guidance and social support system for Chinese farmers are discussed.

In the present work, graphene was evaluated as SPE sorbents for the analytes enrichment and clean up. The target analytes were quantified by a triple-quadrupole linear ion trap MS in multiple-reaction monitoring mode. In addition, the proposed method was validated according to Commission Decision 2002/657/EC. The calibration curve was linear over the range of 0.5100 ng/mL. The mean values of RSD of intra- and interday ranging from 1.48 to 4.29% and from 3.25 to 7.42% were obtained, respectively. In the three fortified levels, the recoveries of CAP ranging from 92.3 to 103.4% with RSDs = 5.58% were obtained. The proposed method has been successfully applied to the analysis of CAP in several aquatic product samples, indicating that graphene was a potential SPE sorbent for the enrichment of trace residues in food samples.

Here, we investigated its role in the inflammatory responses after focal cerebral ischemia. In AQP4-knockout (KO) and wild-type mice, focal cerebral ischemia was induced by 30 min of middle cerebral arterial occlusion (MCAO). Ischemic neuronal injury and cellular inflammatory responses, as well as the expression and localization of cysteinyl leukotriene CysLT(2) and CysLT(1) receptors, were determined at 24 and 72 h after MCAO. AQP4-KO mice showed more neuronal loss, more severe microglial activation and neutrophil infiltration, but less astrocyte proliferation in the brain after MCAO than wild-type mice. In addition, the protein levels of both CysLT(1) and CysLT(2) receptors were up-regulated in the ischemic brain, and the up-regulation was more pronounced in AQP4-KO mice. The CysLT(1) and CysLT(2) receptors were primarily localized in neurons, microglia and neutrophils; those localized in microglia and neutrophils were enhanced in AQP4-KO mice. AQP4 may play an inhibitory role in postischemic inflammation.

The apoptosis-related cytotoxic effects and mechanisms of nodularin on Carassius auratus lymphocytes were investigated. Transmission electron microscopy results showed that nodularin-treated lymphocytes display a series of morphological changes, including condensed cytoplasm, nuclear chromatin agglutination and marginalization. DNA fragmentation was verified by the DNA-ladder and formation of sub-G1 DNA peaks. These cell characteristics confirmed the occurrence of apoptosis in lymphocytes. Flow cytometric results showed that the percentages of apoptotic cells incubated with 1, 5,10, and 100 mu g/L nodularin for 12 h reached 15.76%, 17.36%, 20.34% and 44.21%, respectively: controls showed low rates of apoptosis (2.4%). The mechanism of apoptosis induced by nodularin was determined, and results showed that nodularin exposure caused a significant increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), loss of mitochondrial transmembrane potential in a dose-dependent manner, upregulation of intracellular Ca2+, downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of Bax expression at the mRNA and protein levels, and activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9 without caspase-8. In summary, all the results suggest that nodularin induces lymphocyte apoptosis via the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and destroys the immune response of fish. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Our recent studies have demonstrated that the niacin-induced internalization of HCA(2) receptors is regulated by G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) 2 and arrestin3 and that internalized receptors rapidly recycle back to the cell surface. The investigation presented here used a combination of amino acid deletion and site-directed mutagenesis to identify structural and functional domains within the HCA(2) C terminus and explore their potential roles in receptor phosphorylation, desensitization, and internalization. We first constructed four mutants with deletions of 10 to 15 amino acids each that were distinct from truncated mutants. We success-fully identified different domains responsible for receptor export, constitutive activity, desensitization, phosphorylation, and internalization. We also generated a comprehensive series of alanine substitution mutants, replacing conserved serine and threonine residues in the C terminus with alanine residues to pinpoint the key residues that are essential for GRK2-mediated phosphorylation and arrestin3 association. Moreover, we found that a sequence from residues 329 to 343 in the C-terminal tail of HCA(2) plays a crucial role in keeping HCA(2) in an inactive conformation. These data demonstrate the importance of distinct domains within the C terminus of HCA(2) for receptor cell surface expression, desensitization, and internalization and phosphorylation and stabilization of an inactive receptor conformation.

Targeting STAT3 inhibits growth and enhances radiosensitivity in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma	ORAL ONCOLOGY			English	Article						Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma; STAT3; HIF-1; Stattic; Radiation therapy; Radiosensitization	SMALL-MOLECULE; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; VEGF EXPRESSION; CANCER-THERAPY; ACTIVATION; DIMERIZATION	Objectives: Signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) has been implicated in the development and progression of various solid tumors. We examined the efficacy of STAT3 inhibition as a novel therapeutic option for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Materials and methods: Activation and expression of STAT3 and hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF-1 alpha) in HNSCC cell lines were assessed by immunoblots. The small molecule inhibitor, Stattic, was used to target STAT3 in HNSCC cell lines. MTT assays were performed to determine the effect of STAT3 inhibition on HNSCC cell viability, while clonogenic survival assays were used to assess the ability of Stattic to sensitize HNSCC cells to radiation therapy. We also examined the effect of Stattic on tumor growth and radiosensitivity in vivo using an orthotopic xenograft model of HNSCC. Results: Stattic effectively inhibited STAT3 activation and expression, resulting in decreased cell survival and proliferation and increased radiosensitivity. STAT3-mediated HIF-1 alpha expression was also reduced in response to Stattic treatment. Oral administration of Stattic significantly reduced the growth of HNSCC tumors in a murine orthotopic xenograft, and analysis of tumor lysates confirmed decreased STAT3 phosphorylation.

Inhibition of DNA-PKcs results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation (IR); therefore, this approach has been explored to develop molecular targeted radiosensitizers. Here, we aimed to develop small inhibitory peptides that could specifically target DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation, a critical step for the enzymatic activation of the kinase in response to IR. Methods and Materials: We generated several small fusion peptides consisting of 2 functional domains, 1 an internalization domain and the other a DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation inhibitory domain. We characterized the internalization, toxicity, and radiosensitization activities of the fusion peptides. Furthermore, we studied the mechanisms of the inhibitory peptides on DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and DNA repair. Results: We found that among several peptides, the biotin-labeled peptide 3 (BTW3) peptide, which targets DNA-PKcs threonine 2647 autophosphorylation, can abrogate IR-induced DNA-PKcs activation and cause prolonged g-H2AX focus formation. We demonstrated that BTW3 exposure led to hypersensitivity to IR in DNA-PKcs-proficient cells but not in DNA-PKcs-deficient cells. Conclusions: The small inhibitory peptide BTW3 can specifically target DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation and enhance radiosensitivity; therefore, it can be further developed as a novel class of radiosensitizer.

Here we show that cell cycle status and DNA damage response (DDR) in CSCs probably contribute to their survival in genotoxic insults. In this study, we isolated esophageal cancer stem cells (ECSCs) from esophageal cancer cell line EC9706 by side-population (SP) phenotype through flow cytometry and found that ECSCs preferentially stay quiescent as compared to the non-ECSCs and are more resistant to DNA damage agents. Further study revealed that ECSCs express a lower level of EGFR, phosphoralated Stat3, and c-Myc, yet abnormally upregulated p27. More interestingly, different from non-ECSCs, when suffering DNA damage agents, ECSCs showed attenuated DDR, as well as declined DNA repair potential. These data indicated ECSCs probably employed an impaired DDR to handle severe genomic insults. Conclusively, we infer that the damage-resistance ability of ECSCs is likely attributed to their slow-cycling status and avoidance of apoptosis or senescence triggered by an excessive DDR. J. Cell.

The roles of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis and how it functions in these processes remain elusive. We investigated the function of OLFM4 in tumor growth and metastasis using B16F10 mouse melanoma cells as an experimental system. Our results showed that OLFM4 had no positive effect on cell viability or cell cycle progression in B16F10 cells. However, it significantly suppressed the tumorigenicity of B16F10 cells, i.e., intradermal primary tumor growth and lung metastasis. OLFM4 also suppressed the migration and invasion of B16F10 cells in vitro. For further insight into the mechanisms underlying OLFM4-mediated suppression of tumor progression, we examined the effect of OLFM4 on the expression of integrin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), both of which are involved in tumor progression. Overexpression of OLFM4 clearly reduced the expression levels of integrin alpha 1, integrin alpha 4, integrin alpha 5, integrin alpha 6, and MMP9. Moreover, forced expression of MMP9 attenuated the inhibitory activity of OLFM4 on migration and invasiveness. Our findings provide the experimental evidence that OLFM4 may function as a tumor suppressor and an anti-metastatic gene during tumor progression.

However, the mechanism underlying p-elemene-induced cytotoxicity remains incompletely understood. Here, we show that beta-elemene promoted apoptotic cell death in human glioma cells, downregulated survivin gene expression, and induced caspase-9, -3 and -7 activities. Induction of apoptosis was associated with inhibition of survivin gene expression, and restoration of survivin levels remarkably attenuated beta-elemene-induced glioma cell death. Moreover, we found that the interaction between surviving and HBXIP, a critical regulator of caspase-9 activity, was impaired by P-elemene treatment. The results, therefore, reveal a caspase-mediated apoptotic pathway induced by beta-elemene in human glioma cells, which is associated with downregulation of survivin itself and the interaction between survivin and HBXP.

Freshly harvested mushrooms were fumigated with 0, 10, 20 and 30 mu L L-1 NO at 20 degrees C for 2 h and then taken to examine the antioxidant activities using assays of reducing power, chelating effect on ferrous ions, scavenging effect on hydroxyl free radicals, and 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical scavenging activity. The results showed that the antioxidant activities of the mushrooms fumigated with NO were significantly increased when compared to the controls. Moreover, NO fumigation significantly enhanced phenolic and flavonoid contents and stimulated the activities of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase and chalcone synthase. The results indicated that NO fumigation might have potential application for enhancing the bioactive compounds and improving antioxidant activities in the mushrooms. Furthermore, the data suggested that the NO-induced phenolic and flavonoid accumulation was due to the activation of the biosynthetic pathways in the mushrooms. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that the formation of FDP-lysine (a typical acrolein-lysine adduct) was strongly inhibited in the presence of phloretin and the remaining electrophilic site in FDP-lysine was also blocked by phloretin. Moreover, direct trapping of acrolein by phloretin was found to be responsible for inhibiting the incorporation of carbonyl groups into BSA and oligomerisation in RNase A. Subsequently, the reduction of LDH release in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells under acrolein challenge suggested the cytoprotective effects of phloretin. Such protection might be mediated through inhibiting the increased cellular protein carbonyl level as revealed by Western blotting analysis. The present study highlighted an apple phenolic compound, phloretin as a promising candidate in prevention or treatment of acrolein-associated human diseases. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover. YS triggered a marked increase in endogenous nitric oxide (NO) levels of the fruit during postharvest storage. The NO specific scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-Oxide not Only abolished a YS-triggered NO burst but also inhibited YS-induced decay alleviation and defense responses of the fruit. Together, the data showed that YS may have potential application for reducing decay of peach fruit during postharvest storage. Furthermore, the results demonstrated that the YS-induced decay alleviation and defense responses of peach fruit were dependent on endogenous NO generation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

J	Lu, YG; Gu, F				Lu, Yun-guang; Gu, Feng			EXISTENCE OF GLOBAL BOUNDED WEAK SOLUTIONS TO A KEYFITZ-KRANZER SYSTEM	COMMUNICATIONS IN MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Keyfitz-Kranzer system; compensated compactness theory; global solution	HYPERBOLIC CONSERVATION-LAWS; SPACE DIMENSIONS; CAUCHY-PROBLEM; TRAFFIC FLOW; WELL-POSEDNESS; CHROMATOGRAPHY; MODEL	In this paper, we study the global L-infinity solutions for the Cauchy problem of the nonsymmetric Keyfitz-Kranzer system (1.1). In [Y. G. Lu, J. Funct. Anal., 261, 2797-2815, 2011], the same problem is studied when the nonlinear function phi(rho, w) is of the form Phi(w) - P(rho). In this paper, first we study the case phi (rho, w)= f(rho(alpha)Phi(w)), where alpha > 1 is a constant and Phi(w) > 0, f(r) are two suitable smooth functions of w and the variable r= rho(alpha)Phi(w). Using the compensated compactness method with the help of an L-1 estimate for w(epsilon)(., t)(x), we first prove the pointwise convergence of the approximation functions r(epsilon) =(rho(epsilon))(alpha)Phi(w(epsilon)). Then using a technique different from [Y.G. Lu, J. Funct. Anal., 261, 2797-2815, 2011], we prove the pointwise convergence of rho(epsilon) and w(epsilon) respectively. Second, a similar existence result for systems of more than two equations is obtained when phi(rho, w(1), w(2), ... w(n))= f(rho(alpha)Phi(w(1), w(2), ... w(n))). Third, we obtain a convergence framework of viscosity solutions of system (1.8) in Euler coordinates for a general nonlinear function phi(rho, w(1), w(2), ... w(n)) under the a priori estimate 0 < c <= rho(epsilon) <= 1/c,c> 0, motivated by the papers [L.

In this paper, the higher-order reassigned LPPs and their properties are discussed. With the definition of the modified Wigner-Ville distribution, the reassignment operators of the third, fourth and the arbitrary higher-order reassigned LPP are defined and derived. It is shown that the higher-order reassigned LPPs share the properties with the second order reassigned LPP, such as the non-negativity, non-bilinearity, time and frequency shifts invariance, time-scaling property and energy conservation. The property of the higher-order reassigned LPP to perfectly localize the corresponding order polynomial phase signals is also investigated to obtain improved signal concentration in the time-frequency domain.

The expression patterns of the miRNA genes significantly influence their regulatory activities. By utilizing small RNA (sRNA) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data, the miRNA expression patterns were investigated in four organs (flowers, leaves, roots and seedlings) of Arabidopsis. Based on a set of criteria, dozens of organ-specific miRNAs were discovered. A dominant portion of the organ-specific miRNAs identified from the ARGONAUTE 4-enriched sRNA HTS libraries were highly expressed in flowers. Additionally, the expression of the precursors of the organ-specific miRNAs was analyzed. Degradome sequencing data-based approach was employed to identify the targets of the organ-specific miRNAs. The miRNA-target interactions were used for network construction. Subnetwork analysis unraveled some novel regulatory cascades, such as the feedback regulation mediated by miR161, the potential self-regulation of the genes miR172, miR396, miR398 and miR860, and the miR863-guided cleavage of the SERRATE transcript. Our bioinformatics survey expanded the organ-specific miRNA-target list in Arabidopsis, and could deepen the biological view of the miRNA expression and their regulatory roles.

In addition to being far greater than in most other species, the volume of the human brain exhibits extensive variation and distinct sexual dimorphism in the general population. However, little is known about the genetic mechanisms underlying normal variation as well as the observed sex difference in human brain volume. Here we show that interleukin-3 (IL3) is strongly associated with brain volume variation in four genetically divergent populations. We identified a sequence polymorphism (rs31480) in the IL3 promoter which alters the expression of IL3 by affecting the binding affinity of transcription factor SP1. Further analysis indicated that IL3 and its receptors are continuously expressed in the developing mouse brain, reaching highest levels at postnatal day 1-4. Furthermore, we found IL3 receptor alpha (IL3RA) was mainly expressed in neural progenitors and neurons, and IL3 could promote proliferation and survival of the neural progenitors. The expression level of IL3 thus played pivotal roles in the expansion and maintenance of the neural progenitor pool and the number of surviving neurons. Moreover, we found that IL3 activated both estrogen receptors, but estrogen didn't directly regulate the expression of IL3. Our results demonstrate that genetic variation in the IL3 promoter regulates human brain volume and reveals novel roles of IL3 in regulating brain development.

Zn impurity is expected to severely suppress sign reversed s(+/-)-wave pairing. The experimentally observed suppression of T-c under Zn doping strongly depends on the materials and the charge-carrier contents, which suggests competition of s(++) and s(+/-) pairings in Fe-based superconductors. We study a model incorporating both s(++)- and s(+/-)-pairing couplings by using the Bogoliubov de-Gennes equation, and we show that the Zn impurity strongly suppresses s(+/-) pairing and may induce a transition from the s(+/-) to s(++) wave. Our theory is consistent with various experiments on the impurity effect. We present new experimental data on the Zn-doping SmFe1-xZnxAsO0.9F0.1 of T-c = 50 K, in further support of our proposal.

The crosslink condition effects on the morphology and properties of the EP/ACM blends have been investigated systematically. It is found that the EP/ACM blends are miscible before the crosslinking over the whole composition ranges. In contrast, the reaction induced phase separation (RIPS) takes place for the EP/ACM = 80/20 and 50/50 systems, while other blend systems maintain the homogeneous structure during the crosslink process. It was further found that the phase separation by the crosslinking led to the EP-rich and ACM-rich phases for the blend, indicating the each other inclusion structures for the RIPS systems. The co-crosslink of EP and ACM was also confirmed by the solvent etching experiments. Moreover, the phase structures and physical properties of the EP/ACM blends are much dependent upon the crosslink condition, which provides feasible access for manipulating the structure and properties of the EP/ACM blends.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of psi(3686) -> pi(0)h(c), h(c) -> gamma eta(c) via eta(c) exclusive decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								The process psi(3686) -> pi(0)h(c), h(c) -> gamma eta(c) has been studied with a data sample of 106 +/- 4 million Psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. The mass and width of the P-wave charmonium spin-singlet state h(c)(P-1(1)) are determined by simultaneously fitting distributions of the pi(0) recoil mass for 16 exclusive eta(c) decay modes. The results, M(h(c)) 3525.31 +/- 0.11(stat) +/- 0.14(syst) MeV/c(2) and Gamma(h(c)) = 0.70 +/- 0.28 +/- 0.22 MeV, are consistent with and more precise than previous measurements. We also determine the branching ratios for the 16 exclusive eta(c) decay modes, five of which have not been measured previously. New measurements of the eta(c) line- shape parameters in the E1 transition h(c) -> gamma eta(c) are made by selecting candidates in the h(c) signal sample and simultaneously fitting the hadronic mass spectra for the 16 eta(c) decay channels. The resulting eta(c) mass and width values are M(eta(c)) = 2984.49 +/- 1.16 +/- 0.52 MeV/c(2) and Gamma(eta(c)) 36.4 +/- 3.2 +/- 1.7 MeV.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Bian, J.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurements of branching fractions for psi ' -> pi(0)J/psi and eta J/Psi	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								We present a precision study of the psi' -> pi(0)J/Psi and eta J/Psi decay modes. The measurements are obtained using 106 x 10(6) psi' events accumulated with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII e(+)e(-) collider operating at a center-of-mass energy corresponding to the psi' mass. We obtain B(psi' -> pi(0)J/Psi) = (1.26 +/- 0.02(stat) +/- 0.03(syst)) x 10(-3) and B(psi' -> eta J/Psi) = (33.75 +/- 0.17(stat) +/- 0.86(syst)) x 10(-3). The branching fraction ratio R = B(psi'->pi(0)J/psi)/B(psi'->eta J/psi) is determined to be (3.74 +/- 0.06(stat) +/- 0.04(syst)) x 10(-2). The precision of these measurements of B(Psi' -> pi(0)J/Psi) and R represent a significant improvement over previously published values.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G.

For bipartite graphs, the resource reallocation in such algorithms is analogous to heat spreading (HeatS) or probability spreading (ProbS) processes. The best algorithm to date is a hybrid of the HeatS and ProbS techniques with homogeneous initial resource configurations, which fulfills simultaneously high accuracy and large diversity requirements. We investigate the effect of heterogeneity in initial configurations on the HeatS + ProbS hybrid algorithm and find that both recommendation accuracy and diversity can be further improved in this new setting. Numerical experiments show that the improvement is robust. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, YX; Lu, LY; Zhang, QM; Zhou, T				Zhu, Yu-Xiao; Lu, Linyuan; Zhang, Qian-Ming; Zhou, Tao			Uncovering missing links with cold ends	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Complex networks; Link prediction; Cold ends; Sampling methods	COMPLEX NETWORKS; PREDICTION	To evaluate the performance of prediction of missing links, the known data are randomly divided into two parts, the training set and the probe set. We argue that this straightforward and standard method may lead to terrible bias, since in real biological and information networks, missing links are more likely to be links connecting low-degree nodes. We therefore study how to uncover missing links with low-degree nodes, namely links in the probe set are of lower degree products than a random sampling. Experimental analysis on ten local similarity indices and four disparate real networks reveals a surprising result that the Leicht-Holme-Newman index [EA. Leicht, P. Holme, M.E.J. Newman, Vertex similarity in networks, Phys. Rev. E 73 (2006) 026120] performs the best, although it was known to be one of the worst indices if the probe set is a random sampling of all links. We further propose an parameter-dependent index, which considerably improves the prediction accuracy. Finally, we show the relevance of the proposed index to three real sampling methods: acquaintance sampling, random-walk sampling and path-based sampling. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However the potential of virus technology to express genes to induce phenotypes or to complement mutants in order to understand the function of plant genes is not well documented. Here we exploit Potato virus X as a tool for virus-induced gene complementation (VIGC). Using VIGC in tomato, we demonstrated that ectopic viral expression of LeMADS-RIN, which encodes a MADS-box transcription factor (TF), resulted in functional complementation of the non-ripening rin mutant phenotype and caused fruits to ripen. Comparative gene expression analysis indicated that LeMADS-RIN up-regulated expression of the SBP-box (SQUAMOSA promoter binding protein-like) gene LeSPL-CNR, but down-regulated the expression of LeHB-1, an HD-Zip homeobox TF gene. Our data support the hypothesis that a transcriptional network may exist among key TFs in the modulation of fruit ripening in tomato.

We have recently demonstrated an important effect of PM2.5 on metabolic function. Since transition metals, such as nickel (Ni), represent an important component of exposure in certain environments, and may significantly influence the toxicity of inhalational exposure, we investigated the effects of Ni as a variable component of ambient PM2.5 exposure. Methods: Male ApoE knockout mice were exposed to filtered air (FA), fine-sized nickel sulfate particles alone (Ni) at 0.44 mu g/m(3), concentrated ambient air PM2.5 (CAPs) at a mean of 70 mu g/m(3), or CAPs+ Ni in Tuxedo, NY, 6 hours/day, 5 days/week, for 3 months. Results: Exposure to Ni, irrespective of co-exposure to CAPs, resulted in body weight gain, while exposure to CAPs+ Ni significantly enhanced fasting glucose and worsened insulin resistance measures (HOMA-IR), when compared with exposure to CAPs alone. CAPs+ Ni exposure induced a significant decrease in phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) a. Exposure to Ni or CAPs+Ni significantly induced microcirculatory dysfunction and increased monocytic cell infiltration into lung and adipose, and decreased uncoupling protein 1 expression at gene and protein levels and several brown adipocyte-specific genes in adipose tissue. Conclusions: Ni exposure has effects on metabolic and inflammatory parameters that are comparable to that of CAPs. Additionally, Ni synergistically exacerbates CAPs-induced adverse effects on some of, but not all of, these parameters, that may be mediated via the AMPK signaling pathway. These findings have important implications for inhaled transition metal toxicity that may exert synergistic effects with other PM2.5 components.

Here we report that, in parallel to the AGM region, the E10.5-E11.5 mouse head harbors bona fide HSCs, as defined by long-term, high-level, multilineage reconstitution and self-renewal capacity in adult recipients, before HSCs enter the circulation. The presence of hemogenesis in the midgestation head is indicated by the appearance of intravascular cluster cells and the blood-forming capacity of a sorted endothelial cell population. In addition, lineage tracing via an inducible VE-cadherin-Cre transgene demonstrates the hemogenic capacity of head endothelium.

The mortality rates are significantly different between pairs of the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) triplets that generate the same ISS/NISS total. METHODS The Logarithm Injury Severity Score (LISS) is defined as a change in MS values by raising each MS severity score (1-6) by taking the natural logarithm to a power of 5.53 multiplied by 1.7987 and then adding the three most severe injuries (i.e. highest AIS), regardless of body region. LISS values were calculated for every patient in three large independent data sets: 3,784, 4,436, and 4,018 patients treated over a six-year period at Class A tertiary comprehensive hospitals in China. The power of LISS to predict morality was then compared with previously calculated NISS values for the same patients in each of the three data sets. RESULTS We found that LISS is more predictive of survival as well (Hangzhou: receiver operating characteristic (ROC): NISS=0.931, LISS=0.949, p=0.006; Similarly, Zhejiang and Shenyang: ROC NISS vs. LISS, p<0.05). Moreover, LISS provides a better fit throughout its entire range of predicting (Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic for Hangzhou NISS=15.76, p=0.027; LISS=13.79, p=0.055; Similarly, for Zhejiang and Shenyang). CONCLUSION LISS should be used as the standard summary measure of human trauma.

The PB is effective in retarding the combustion of PC. It was found that a borosilicate glassy layer and Si-C cross-linking structure were formed on the surface of the FR-PC during combustion. The PB promoted the formation of the dense char that protected the matrix of plastic, and could moderate the combustion process. According to cone colorimeter test, the heat release rate, smoke, CO and CO2 emissions of the PC/PB composite (FR-PC) obviously decreased in comparison with virgin PC. The PB significantly improved the flame retardancy of the PC, and decreased the fire hazard.

The composites before and after exposure to UV radiation were studied by mechanical testing, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results suggest that a pronounced enhancement in the flexural and impact strength is obtained for the composites with 40 wt% wood flour treated by TF3 which make it difficult to crosslink exposure to UV radiation. TF17 facilitates the crosslink of composites after exposure to UV radiation, via generation of covalent bonding between fluorinated silane and PVDF. Si lane modifies the filler surface, which might improve filler particle dispersion into the polymer matrix, but could block polymer inclusion into the wood capillaries, thus increasing the mobility of the amorphous polymer phase and decreasing the T-g of WF/PVDF composites. During exposure to UV radiation, cross linking and chain scission reactions both in the solid amorphous state and crystalline phase of composites are competitive. When reactions in amorphous are dominant, the molecule chains rearrange and form new crystals, which increase melting endotherms (Delta H-f) and crystallinity (X-c) of composites.

Nevertheless, pharmacological and genetic blockade of p53 functions results in similar or delayed sensitivity to MMS treatment, suggesting the presence of p53-independent apoptotic mechanisms. To understand the p53-independent mechanisms that are engaged during MMS-induced apoptosis, we established MMS-induced apoptotic cell models using p53-deficient H1299 and Hep3B cells. Our results demonstrated that MMS at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 400 and 800 mu M induced the formation of gammaH2AX foci, and that at higher concentrations, 400 and 800 mu M, MMS treatment led to apoptosis in the two cell lines. This apoptotic cell death was concurrent with the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, nuclear-cytosolic translocation of active caspase 2, release of cytochrome c from mitochondria, and the cleavage of caspase 9, caspase 3 and PARP. However, MMS-induced DNA damage failed to stabilize the p53 family members TAp73 and DNp73. These results demonstrated a p53- and p73-independent mechanism for MMS-induced apoptosis that involves the nuclear-cytosolic translocation of active caspase 2 as well as the mitochondria-mediated pathway.

J	Kira, M				Kira, Mitsuo			Reactions of a stable dialkylsilylene and their mechanisms	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Stable silylene; mechanisms; photoreaction; addition; insertion; DFT	ISOLABLE SILYLENE; DOUBLE-BOND; RADIATIONLESS PROCESSES; HALOPHILIC REACTIONS; LOW COORDINATION; TRIPLET-STATE; SOLID-STATE; CHEMISTRY; SILICON; REARRANGEMENT	Various reactions for a stable dialkylsilylene, 2,2,5,5-tetrakis(trimethylsilyl)silacyclopentane-1,1-diyl (1), are summarized and their mechanisms are discussed. Silylene 1 isomerizes to the corresponding silaethene via the 1,2-trimethylsilyl migration. Reduction of 1 with alkali metals affords the corresponding radical anion 1 (. -aEuro parts per thousand) with a relatively small Si-29 hfs constant (2.99 mT) and a large g-factor (g = 2.0077) compared with those for trivalent silyl radicals. Photo-excitation of 1 generates the corresponding singlet excited state (1 (1 auaEuro parts per thousand)) with the lifetime of 80.5 ns. The excited state reacts with C=C double bond compounds including benzene, naphthalene, and (E)- and (Z)-2-butenes. Although the thermal reactions of 1 with haloalkanes occur via radical mechanisms, the insertion into O-H, Si-H and Si-Cl bonds proceeds concertedly via the three-membered cyclic transition states. The reaction of 1 with H2SiCl2 gives the Si-Cl insertion product exclusively, while the quantitative insertion to Si-H bond occurs when Me2SiHCl is used as a substrate. The origin of the rather unusual Si-H/Si-Cl selectivity is elucidated using DFT calculations. Silylene 1 adds to C=C, Ca parts per thousand C, and C=O pi bonds to afford the corresponding silacycles as stable compounds. The importance of the carbonyl silaylides during the reactions of silylenes with aldehydes and ketones is emphasized.

The electrons transfer from enzyme in the electrode to COCs was the key step, which determined the average current efficiency and was influenced by the pH and temperature of the systems. Specifically, the effect of temperature (288-318 K) and pH (2-11) was examined. The results showed that high temperature and acid conditions were beneficial to the catalytic dechlorination of TCA. Favorable degradation conditions for TCA by Hb-MWCNT-GE were found to be pH 3 and 310 K. The activation energy for TCA of the Hb-MWCNT-GE was calculated to be 19 kJ.mol-1. Total mass balance (on molar basis) of the reactant and the products was in the range of 95-104% during the bioelectrochemically reductive reaction. Based on the intermediates detected, a pathway was proposed for TCA degradation in which it undergoes dechlorination process. A reduction by sequential reactions is not a main degradation mechanism for the dechlorination of TCA in HbMWCNT-GE system but a reductive dechlorination by parallel reaction mechanism can rather be the one for the TCA degradation. Such studies provide relevant information about the applicability of bioelectrocatalytic systems for remediation of raw wastewaters.

Here, based on the transport and magnetization measurements, we report the Cu doping effects on the physical properties of Fe1.05Te compound. We found that in the undoped sample, an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition accompanying a semiconductor-metal transition occurs at 70 K. With the increase of Cu content x, the AFM transition temperature decreases monotonously at first. When x >= 0.05, both the metallic behavior and long-range AFM ordering disappear. Meanwhile, a spin-glass state emerges at low temperatures. The evolution of the transport and the magnetic properties with the Cu content x is summarized and a phase diagram is proposed.

J	Jiang, HM; Yao, ZJ; Zhang, FC				Jiang, Hong-Min; Yao, Zi-Jian; Zhang, Fu-Chun			Fermi surface nesting and spin density wave instability in the overdoped superconducting iron pnictides	EPL			English	Article							COMPETING ORDERS	The nesting of electron Fermi pocket with one of the two hole pockets around the Brillouin zone center has been attributed to the spin density wave (SDW) instability in the parent compound of superconducting iron pnictides. We propose here that the second hole Fermi pocket may be nested with the electron pocket in the doped case, which results in a new SDW instability. Our work is motivated by and may explain the recent scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STM) measurements on NaFe1-xCoxAs, which show an asymmetric gap-like feature near the Fermi level in the overdoped regime (Zhou X. et al., Phys. Rev. Lett., 109 (2012) 037002). We use a multi-band model to examine this feature within random phase approximation to include the coupling between the itinerant electron and the local spins.

Using our approach, the user first takes an RGBD image of an indoor scene, which is automatically segmented into a set of regions with semantic labels. If the segmentation is not satisfactory, the user can draw some strokes to guide the algorithm to achieve better results. After the segmentation is finished, the depth data of each semantic region is used to retrieve a matching 3D model from a database. Each model is then transformed according to the image depth to yield the scene. For large scenes where a single image can only cover one part of the scene, the user can take multiple images to construct other parts of the scene. The 3D models built for all images are then transformed and unified into a complete scene. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach by modeling several real-world scenes.

Both hard and soft classification methods are used throughout the growing season to generate cropland distribution maps using multiple remotely sensed data. Hard classification models (HCMs) yield good results in large homogeneous areas where pure pixels are dominant, but they fail in fragmented areas where mixed pixels are dominant. Conversely, soft classification models (SCMs) are thought to have greater accuracy in fragmented areas than in regions with pure pixels. To take advantage of both methods, we develop a hard and SCM (HSCM) based on existing HCMs and SCMs, and test it using data from simulated images as well as actual satellite data from southeast Beijing, China. The model assessment was performed using three statistical metrics at scales ranging from 1 x 1 to 10 x 10 pixels. The results reveal that the HSCM has the highest classification accuracy and produces more reasonable cropland distribution maps than those produced by either HCMs or SCMs. Moreover, the theory and methods employed in developing the HSCM provide a unifying framework for mapping land cover types, and they can be applied to different HCMs and SCMs beyond those currently in use.

To investigate the effect of plasmid size on the performance of Escherichia coli host strains during plasmid preparation, we employed E. coli JM109 and TOP10 cells to prepare four plasmids ranging from 4.7 to 16.8 kb in size. Each plasmid was extracted from JM109 and TOP10 cells using an alkaline lysis mini-preparation method. However, when commercial kits were used to extract the same plasmids from JM109 cells, the large molecular weight plasmids substantially degraded, compared with their smaller counterparts. No degradation was observed when the four plasmids were extracted from E. coli TOP10 cells using the same commercial kit. We conclude, therefore, that the performance of E. coli in high quality plasmid preparations can be affected by plasmid size.

Suspended particles are also the main optically active substances for ocean color remote sensing. It is important to study the surface reflectance spectra features of coastal turbid water, as it can be the basis for establishing more accurate remote-sensing inversion models. In this study, Hangzhou Bay, China, was selected as the study area. Two in situ measurement and sampling stations in the estuary of the Qiantang River which flows into Hangzhou Bay were set up separately. Above-water spectrum observation method, which the NASA recommended, was adopted to measure the reflection spectrum of turbid waters. Surface water samples were simultaneously collected to obtain the corresponding SSC data. The results showed that the total suspended particle concentrations in the Hangzhou Bay were typically high, and the inorganic suspended particle concentrations were far greater than the phytoplankton concentrations, which averages 705 mg/L and 1.16 mg/m(3). The SSC at two sampling stations both showed significant temporal variability, particularly appearing short-period rapid fluctuations accompanying the tidal cycle. The measured surface water reflectance spectra all showed typical curve characteristics of high turbid water, and as the SSC increased, the corresponding reflectivity of surface water also increased. The increments at different wavelengths were variational, with two reflectance peaks appearing at 650-700-nm and near the 800-nm wavelength of spectral curves, respectively. The first derivative of spectral curves showed that the first reflectance peak location appeared to be a "red shift" phenomenon with the SSC increasing. The correlation coefficients between the SSC of surface water and the remote-sensing reflectance according to moderate resolution imaging spectra-radiometer (MODIS) channels' central wavelength were different significantly, which were larger at MODIS long-wavelength channels (> 650 nm) and smaller at MODIS short-wavelength channels (400-550 nm). The value of determination coefficient R-2 was 0.82 when the reflectance ratio of MODIS band 2 to band 1 was selected as the SSC sensitive bands combination and exponential regression analysis was employed. Therefore, the reflectance ratio of MODIS band 2 to band 1 can be adopted as the main band combination for establishing surface water SSC remote-sensing inversion model in the Hangzhou Bay.

METHODS: Consecutive biopsy-proven NAFLD patients were recruited from a single center from January 2005 to December 2010. Advanced fibrosis (stage 3 and 4) was defined using Kleiner criteria. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to compare the diagnostic accuracy of the NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), FIB-4 index, aspartate transaminase (AST)/platelet ratio index (APRI), AST/alanine transaminase (ALT) ratio (AAR) and body mass index (BMI)-AAR-Diabetes (BARD) score. RESULTS: Of the patients with NAFLD, 79.6% were males with a mean age of 37.1 years, mean BMI of 26.1 kg/m(2) and 41.4% of them had nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, and 24 (15.8%) had advanced fibrosis. The AUROC of the FIB-4 index, APRI, AAR, NFS and BARD score for advanced fibrosis were 0.756, 0.742, 0.670, 0.653 and 0.642 (P < 0.05 for all), respectively. A concordant negative predictive value of approximately 90% was indicated whereas the positive predictive values were modest for all tests, and only the FIB-4 index yielded a higher positive likelihood ratio of 7.65. Using these cut-off values of tests for excluding advanced fibrosis could reduce the use of liver biopsy in 56.674.3% of the patients, with a minor false negative rate of 5.39.9%. CONCLUSIONS: Although slightly less accurate than liver biopsy, simple noninvasive tests can reliably exclude advanced fibrosis in Chinese NAFLD patients in our center. FIB-4 index performs better than the other tests under examination.

However, whether sequence divergence in the 3'-untranslated region (3'-UTR) has an impact on the subfunctionalization of duplicate genes remains unclear. Here, we identified two diverging duplicate vsx1 (visual system homeobox-1) loci in goldfish, named vsx1A1 and vsx1A2. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 may arise from a duplication of vsx1 after the separation of goldfish and zebrafish. Sequence comparison revealed that divergence in both transcriptional and translational regulatory regions is higher than divergence in the introns. vsx1A2 expresses during blastula and gastrula stages and in adult retina but silences from segmentation stage to hatching stage, vsx1A1 starts expression from segmentation onward. Comparing to that zebrafish vsx1 expresses in all the developmental stages and in the adult retina, it appears that goldfish vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 are under going to share the functions of ancestral vsx1. The different but overlapping temporal expression patterns of vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 suggest that sequence divergence in the promoter region of duplicate vsx1 is not sufficient for partitioning the functions of ancestral vsx1. By comparing vsx1A1 and vsx1A2 3'-UTR-linked green fluorescent protein gene expression patterns, we demonstrated that the 3'-UTR of vsx1A1 remains but the 3'-UTR of vsx1A2 has lost the capability of mediating bipolar cell specific expression during retina development. These results indicate that sequence divergence in the 3'-UTRs has a clear effect on subfunctionalization of the duplicate genes. J. Exp. Zool. (Mol. Dev. Evol.) 318B:531544, 2012.

J	Dong, FF; Liu, CX; Kong, DX				Dong, Fangfang; Liu, Chunxiao; Kong, De-Xing			A fast algorithm for image segmentation based on fuzzy region competition	ADVANCES IN COMPUTATIONAL MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Image segmentation; Variational models; Level set method; Fuzzy region competition; Split Bregman method; Jia and Zhao's algorithm	TOTAL VARIATION MINIMIZATION; ACTIVE CONTOURS; RESTORATION; FRAMEWORK; MODEL	Variational models for image segmentation are usually solved by the level set method, which is not only slow to compute but also dependent on initialization strongly. Recently, fuzzy region competition models or globally convex segmentation models have been introduced. They are insensitive to initialization, but contain TV-regularizers, making them difficult to compute. Goldstein, Bresson and Osher have applied the split Bregman iteration to globally convex segmentation models which avoided the regularization of TV norm and speeded up the computation. However, the split Bregman method needs to solve a partial differential equation (PDE) in each iteration. In this paper, we present a simple algorithm without solving the PDEs proposed originally by Jia et al. (2009) with application to image segmentation problems. The algorithm also avoids the regularization of TV norm and has a simpler form, which is in favor of implementing. Numerical experiments show that our algorithm works faster and more efficiently than other fast schemes, such as duality based methods and the split Bregman scheme.

However, use of these catalysts poses significant difficulties in handling and separation. In this work, fluorine-containing polysiloxanes were synthesized through a novel and environmentally friendly method: ring-opening copolymerization of trifluoropropyltrimethylcyclotrisiloxane with cyclotetrasiloxane catalyzed by rare earth solid superacid SO$_{4}boolean AND{2-}$/TiO2/Ln3+. The effects of reaction conditions were examined in detail. The yield sequence of various rare earth catalysts is Nd similar to La similar to Y similar to Sm > Gd, while the number-average molecular weight sequence is Nd > La > Y > Sm > Gd. The optimum conditions for the ring-opening copolymerization of trifluoropropyltrimethylcyclotrisiloxane with cyclotetrasiloxane are as follows: [Nd3+] = 0.05 mol L-1 and $[\hbox{SO}_{4}boolean AND{2-}] = 1.85$ mol L-1 in the immersing solution, SO$_{4}boolean AND{2-}$/TiO2/Nd3+ calcined at 500 degrees C and the copolymerization conducted at 80 degrees C for 40 min. Structures of resulting copolymers were characterized using size exclusion chromatography, 1H NMR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis and contact angle measurements. According to the copolymerization features, a cationic equilibrium reaction mechanism is proposed.

Characteristics of fertile somatic hybrids of G-hirsutum L. and G-trilobum generated via protoplast fusion	THEORETICAL AND APPLIED GENETICS			English	Article							COTTON GOSSYPIUM-HIRSUTUM; PIMA COTTON; ANDERSS; YIELDS; GENE	Fertile somatic hybrids between tetraploid upland cotton G. hirsutum L. cv. Coker 312 and wild cotton G. trilobum were generated by symmetric electrofusion. Comparisons of morphology, combined with flow cytometric, RAPD, SRAP and AFLP analyses confirmed the hybrid nature of the regenerated plants. The hybrids differed morphologically from the parent plants. Flow cytometric analysis showed that the hybrids had DNA similar in amount to the total combined DNA content of the two parents, and the use of molecular markers revealed that the hybrids contained genomic fragments from both fusion parents, further indicating the hybrid nature of the regenerated plants. The stability of the morphological features of the hybrids was examined in following generations. The hexaploid fusion plants showed strong photosynthesis and a high expression level of some photosystem-related genes. Our results suggest that novel traits may be incorporated in cotton breeding programs through the production of somatic hybrids and the backcrossing of these plants with elite cultivars.	[Yu, X.

Derived from the Laplace-Beltrami operator, a set of orthogonal manifold harmonics basis functions is first adopted to span the spectral space of the underlying three-dimensional (3D) mesh. The minimal number of the basis functions required in the proposed algorithm is also determined, which can effectively accelerate the spectrum computations. Then, to assert ownership and resist 3D mesh forging, a digital signature algorithm is adopted to sign the watermark in the embedding phase and to verify the signature in the extraction phase, which could optimize the robust non-blind spectral watermarking algorithm framework. To improve the robustness of the embedded watermark signature, the input 3D mesh will be segmented into patches. The watermark signature bits are embedded into the low-frequency spectral coefficients of all patches repeatedly and extracted with regard to the corresponding variations of their coefficients. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the efficiency, invisibility, and robustness of the proposed algorithm. Compared with existing watermarking algorithms, our algorithm exhibits better visual quality and is more robust to resist various geometric and connectivity attacks.

The designer specifies the geometry and a time-varying rotation and translation of each rigid feature component. Our algorithm automatically generates a mechanism assembly located in a box below the feature base that produces the specified motion. Parts in the assembly are selected from a parameterized set including belt-pulleys, gears, crank-sliders, quick-returns, and various cams (snail, ellipse, and double-ellipse).

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa) infection is a leading cause of death. Mice infected with live P. aeruginosa exhibit significantly decreased VDUP1 expression. However, the function of VDUP1 during P. aeruginosa-induced mouse bacteremic shock is unknown. To address the function of VDUP1 in P. aeruginosa-infected mice, we constructed a bacteremic shock model wherein both wild-type and VDUP1-deficient mice were infected intra-peritoneally with live P. aeruginosa. We found that VDUP1-deficient mice were more resistant to P. aeruginosa-induced bacteremic shock than wild-type mice, as shown by the increased survival, accelerated bacterial clearance and suppression of cytokine overproduction of the VDUP1-deficient mice. VDUP1 promoted the recruitment of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavities of infected mice. VDUP1 impeded the phagocytosis of non-opsonized P. aeruginosa via phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway in macrophages. P. aeruginosa infection induced the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and the increased production of ROS by the peritoneal cells of VDUP1-deficient mice was advantageous in clearing the bacteria. Overall, VDUP1 aggravates bacteremic shock; thus, VDUP1 can be considered a target molecule for the inhibition of P. aeruginosa-induced bacteremic shock. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We retrieved randomized controlled clinical trials related to the use of beta-elemene Injection as an adjunctive treatment for lung cancer from Chinese Biomedical (CBMweb), Chinese Medical Current Content (CMCC), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), ChinaInfo, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; MEDLINE, EMBASE, OVID and TCMLARS. We also referred to an unpublished conference proceeding titled Clinical Use and Basic: Elemene Injection. We then divided the studies into non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) subgroups by RevMan 5.1 software. A total of 21 source documents (1,467 patients) matched pre-specified criteria for determining the effectiveness and safety of beta-elemene Injection as an adjunctive treatment for lung cancer. Five studies involving 285 NSCLC patients reported a higher 24-month survival rate (39.09%) with the adjunctive treatment than with chemotherapy alone (26.17%; RR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.03 to 2.21). Four studies involving 445 patients reported that the increased probability for improved performance status for patients treated with elemene-based combinations was higher than that of patients treated with chemotherapy alone (RR, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.45 to 2.29). The results from a subgroup analysis on 12 studies involving 974 NSCLC patients and 9 studies involving 593 patients with both SCLC and NSCLC showed that the tumor control rate for NSCLC improved more in the elemene-based combinations treatment group (78.70%) than in the chemotherapy alone control group (71.31%; RR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.12). The tumor response rate for NSCLC also improved more among patients treated with elemenebased combinations (50.71%) than among patients treated with chemotherapy alone (38.04%; RR, 1.34; 95%CI, 1.17 to 1.54). In addition, the main adverse reaction to beta-elemene Injection was phlebitis, but usually only to a mild degree. An Egger's test showed no publication bias in our study (P=0.7030). The effectiveness of chemotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer may improve when combined with beta-elemene injection as an adjunctive treatment. The combined treatment can result in an improved quality of life and prolonged survival. However, these results require confirmation by rigorously controlled trials.

The weight ratio between carbon nanofibers and SnO2 NPs, which seriously affects the battery performance, has been demonstrated to be easily tuned by adjusting the sintering temperature. The electrochemical investigations show that the SnO2 NPs@carbon nanofibers with 9 wt% carbon have the best performance with the highest capacity of 383 mAh g(-1) after 30 cycles at a current density of 100 mA g(-1).

Online FTIR measurements illustrate that aniline is a major product of DPG decomposition. The observation that the activation energy depends on the extent of conversion indicates that the DPG decomposition kinetics features multiple processes. The initial elimination of aniline from DPG involves two pathways because of the isomerization of DPG. Mass spectrometry and thin film chromatography suggest that there are two major intermediate products with the major one of C21N3H17. The most probable kinetic model deduced through multivariate nonlinear regression method agrees well with the experimental data with a correlation coefficient of 0.9998. The temperature-independent function of conversion f(alpha), activation energy E and the pre-exponential factor A of DPG decomposition was also established through model-fitting method in this research.

The polymer and QDs solution was emulsified into monodispersed microdroplets by the CFD and obtained droplets were solidified via solvent evaporation. Polymer microbeads can be fabricated in a range of different sizes through changing the flow rates of the two immiscible phases, and have a highly narrow size distribution and uniform shape. QDs-encoding capacity of the microbeads was investigated through adjusting the concentrations and ratios of QDs in the polymer solution. Mono-color encoded microbeads with five intensities and a dual-color QDs-encoded 5 x 5 microbeads array were obtained, and the spectral profiles of the microbeads were examined by a fluorescent microscope coupled with a spectral imaging system. QDs-tagged microbeads prepared with this method were more stable than the porous beads swollen with QDs in the buffer with various pH and crosslinking chemicals. Finally, the application of such microbeads for biomolecule detection was demonstrated by conjugation of rabbit IgG molecules on the surface of the microbeads via carboxyl groups, which were then detected by fluorophores-labeled goat-anti-rabbit IgG antibodies.

Accounting for environmental and temporal variation in multispecies trait comparisons of native and invasive species might help explain such inconsistency. The relative importance of light and nutrient availability was tested in a greenhouse experiment on trait expression and variation of 15 native and 15 invasive herb species from Southeast China. In addition, N uptake of a subset of these species and its temporal pattern were assessed by means of a N-15 tracer experiment. A predominant lack of significant differences between the two status groups indicated strong overall trait similarities, thus supporting the 'join-the-local' hypothesis. However, at high light levels, the invasive species displayed significantly higher trait relative growth rates, whereas the native species had a higher tissue quality as displayed in a higher dry matter content of shoots and leaves. The invasion success of the invasive species could neither be explained by a general higher N uptake nor by a distinction in temporal N uptake strategy between native and invasive species. Despite comparable fundamental niches of the species, increased growth rates under beneficial light conditions may provide a head start advantage for invasive species compared to native ones. The present study confirms the assumption of an opportunistic strategy for invasive species and emphasizes the Reed to assess trait variation between native and invasive species in different environmental contexts.

J	Ye, YQ; Chang, SW				Ye, Yuqian; Chang, Shu-Wei			Self-induced spin-polarized carrier source in active photonic device with artificial optical chirality	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							INJECTION; BAND	We demonstrate a scheme of active photonic devices which can spontaneously polarize the carrier spin in active regions. Rather than externally breaking the time-reversal symmetry of carrier spin states such as applying magnetic fields, only the optical chirality is required in this setup. Spin-polarized carriers are generated by interactions between carriers and self-initiated circularly polarized photons without the spin-selective optical pumping/electrical injection and breaking of the reciprocity. The device requires a cavity which supports modes with only one circular polarization and can be implemented with the vertical-cavity type of arrangements for distributed Bragg reflectors and artificial chiral photonic structures.

The present protocol can be regarded as a straightforward synthetic transformation of tertiary amines to the esterification of equimolar amounts of acid. Moreover, the reaction is fundamentally new chemistry for the sp(3) C-N bond cleavage coupled with esterification. The esterification reaction conditions are very mild and functional group-tolerated, such as hydrosilanes, alcohols, phenol, and amino acids. A mechanism is proposed in which the tertiary amine reacts with dimethyl but-2-ynedioate to form zwitterionic salt, and then the zwitterionic intermediate subsequently accept hydrogen to assist the nucleophilic attack of oxygen atom of carboxyl group at the benzyl group of tertiary amine, while a separate reaction pathway leads to esterification.

BESIII Collaboration	Experimental study of psi ' decays to K+K- pi(0) and K+K-eta	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using (106 +/- 4) x 10(6) psi ' events accumulated with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII e(+)e(-) collider, we present measurements of the branching fractions for psi' decays to K+K- pi(0) and K+K- eta. In these final states, the decay psi' -> K-2(*) (1430)(+) K- + 10(-5), is observed for the first time, and its branching fraction is measured to be (7.12 +/- 0: 62(stat)(-0.61)(+1.13) (syst)) x 10(-5), which indicates a violation of the helicity selection rule in psi' decays. The branching fractions of psi' -> K* (892)(+) K- + c.c., phi eta, and phi pi(0) are also measured. The measurements are used to test the QCD predictions on charmonium decays.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F.

Recent studies suggest that NRG1 signaling plays a role in remyelination of regenerated nerves after injury. In this study, we investigated the role of Erbin, a protein that interacts with ErbB2 in remyelination of injured nerves. We show that Erbin expression increased dramatically in injured nerves. Myelinated axons were fewer, and g-ratios of those that were myelinated were increased in erbin(-/-) mice, which were impaired in functional recovery from nerve injury. These results indicate a necessary role of Erbin in remyelination of regenerating axons. Erbin ablation had little effect on numbers of BrdU-labeled and TUNEL-labeled SCs, suggesting mechanisms independent of altered proliferation or apoptosis. We demonstrated that Erbin mutant mice were impaired in raising or maintaining the levels of ErbB2 and in producing NRG1 in axons. Together, these observations demonstrate that Erbin is required for remyelination of regenerated axons after injury, probably by regulating ErbB2 and NRG1 levels, identifying a novel player in regulating remyelination.

J	Wang, DY; Liu, DQ; Li, SF; Zang, YF				Wang, De-Yi; Liu, Dong-Qiang; Li, Su-Fang; Zang, Yu-Feng			Increased local synchronization of resting-state fMRI signal after episodic memory encoding reflects off-line memory consolidation	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						episodic memory consolidation; local synchronization; medial temporal lobe; resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging	REGIONAL HOMOGENEITY; HUMAN BRAIN; FLUCTUATIONS; EXPERIENCES; DISEASE; REPLAY	The changes of spontaneous activity from before and after a memory or learning task had been considered to be related to off-line memory consolidation process in human brain by using resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) MRI (fMRI). However, RSFC reflects temporal synchronization of timecourses of spatially distinct brain regions and therefore could not determine which specific brain region is involved in the memory consolidation process. Here we used regional homogeneity (ReHo), a method for measuring local synchronization, to link the local spontaneous activity change to off-line episodic memory consolidation. We hypothesized that the spontaneous activity change would be different between people with better memory performance and those with worse performance in memory-related regions. All participants completed two resting-state sessions, that is, before (REST-1) and after (REST-2) an episodic memory encoding task (picture indoor or outdoor judgment). Then, based on the d' of a later surprise memory retrieval test, a high-performance group and a low-performance group, each consisting of 16 participants, were chosen from whole 58 participants. We defined a ReHo ratio, that is, ReHo of REST-2 divided by ReHo of REST-1, as a change induced by memory consolidation. The high-performance group showed a significant higher ReHo ratio than low-performance group in medial temporal lobe (MTL) including parahippocampal and anterior temporal regions. The current results provide neuroimaging evidence supporting that the MTL is involved in off-line memory consolidation of episodic memory. Moreover, this study may provide a paradigm for understanding of episodic memory deficit in Alzheimer's disease.

BESIII Collaboration	Evidence for the Direct Two-Photon Transition from psi(3686) to J/psi	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								The two-photon transition psi(3686) -> gamma gamma J/psi is studied in a sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi(3686) decays collected by the BESIII detector. The branching fraction is measured to be (3.1 +/- 0.6(stat)(-1.0)(+0.8)(syst)) x 10(-4) using J/psi -> e(+)e(-) and J/psi -> mu(+)mu(-) decays, and its upper limit is estimated to be 4.5 x 10(-4) at the 90% confidence level. This work represents the first measurement of a two-photon transition among charmonium states. The orientation of the psi(3686) decay plane and the J/psi polarization in this decay are also studied. In addition, the product branching fractions of sequential E1 transitions psi(3686) -> gamma chi(cJ) and chi(cJ) -> gamma J/psi (J = 0, 1, 2) are reported.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; An, Z. H.; Bai, J.

They are generated from stem-loop-structured precursors through two sequential Dicer-like 1 (DCL1)-mediated cleavages. To date, hundreds of plant miRNAs have been uncovered. However, the question, whether the sequences reverse complementary (RC) to the miRNA precursors could form hairpin-like structures and produce sRNA duplexes similar to the miRNA/miRNA* pairs has not been solved yet. Here, we interrogated this possibility in 16 plant species based on sRNA high-throughput sequencing data and secondary structure prediction. A total of 59 RC sequences with great potential to form stem-loop structures and generate miRNA/miRNA*-like duplexes were identified in ten plants, which were named as RC-miRNA precursors. Unlike the canonical miRNAs, only a few cleavage targets of the RC-miRNAs were identified in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa), and none in Soybean (Glycine max) based on degradome data. Surprisingly, the genomic regions surrounding some of the RC-miRNA target recognition sites were observed to be specifically methylated in both Arabidopsis and rice. Taken together, we reported a new class of miRNAs, called RC-miRNAs, which were generated from the antisense strands of the miRNA precursors. Based on the results, we speculated that the mature RC-miRNAs might have subtle regulatory activity through target cleavages, but might possess short interfering RNA-like activity by guiding sequence-specific DNA methylation.

J	Li, BW; Fu, CB; Zhang, H; Wang, XG				Li, Bing-Wei; Fu, Chenbo; Zhang, Hong; Wang, Xingang			Synchronization and quorum sensing in an ensemble of indirectly coupled chaotic oscillators	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; COLLECTIVE BEHAVIOR; POPULATION; TRANSITIONS; STABILITY; CLOCK; DEATH	The fact that the elements in some realistic systems are influenced by each other indirectly through a common environment has stimulated a new surge of studies on the collective behavior of coupled oscillators. Most of the previous studies, however, consider only the case of coupled periodic oscillators, and it remains unknown whether and to what extent the findings can be applied to the case of coupled chaotic oscillators. Here, using the population density and coupling strength as the tuning parameters, we explore the synchronization and quorum sensing behaviors in an ensemble of chaotic oscillators coupled through a common medium, in which some interesting phenomena are observed, including the appearance of the phase synchronization in the process of progressive synchronization, the various periodic oscillations close to the quorum sensing transition, and the crossover of the critical population density at the transition. These phenomena, which have not been reported for indirectly coupled periodic oscillators, reveal a corner of the rich dynamics inherent in indirectly coupled chaotic oscillators, and are believed to have important implications to the performance and functionality of some realistic systems.

Healthy adult frogs were exposed to 2.5, 5, 7.5, or 10 mg/L of cadmium solution for 14 days. The results showed that exposure to these concentrations increased the levels of reactive oxygen species and malondialdehyde content in the testes, clearly indicating a dose-effect relationship. Moreover, the same dosages of Cd2+ solution increased glutathione (reduced) content, with the values being significantly different from those observed in the control group (P < 0.01). The comet assay results demonstrated that the DNA damage rate, tail length, and tail moment of samples obtained from frogs exposed to 2.5-7.5 mg/L of cadmium solution significantly increased compared with those of samples obtained from the control group (P < 0.01). These findings suggest that cadmium can induce free radical generation, followed by lipid peroxidation and DNA damage. Ultrastructural observation revealed vacuoles in the spermatogenic cells, cell dispersion, incomplete cell structures, and deformed nucleoli. Moreover, cadmium exposure induced significant down-regulation of Bcl-2 expression and up-regulation of Bax and caspase-3 expressions. Taken together, these data indicate that cadmium can induce testicular cell apoptosis in R. limnocharis. Exploring the effects of cadmium on the mechanism of reproductive toxicity in amphibians will help provide a scientific basis accounting for the global population decline in amphibian species.

However, direct loading of uniform metal nanoparticles such as Pt on graphene remains a challenge due to the hydrophobic nature of graphene. We herein demonstrate that Pt nanoparticles with uniform size and high dispersion were deposited on graphene surfaces via a facile and efficient supercritical fluid method. The graphene sheets used in this work were produced by rapid thermal expansion of graphite oxide. With the help of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2), Pt nanoparticles with a mean size of 3.28 nm are evenly distributed on graphene upon the reduction of an organic platinum precursor. The electrocatalytic investigations reveal that the current density of methanol electrooxidation with the resultant Pt/graphene catalyst was similar to 3.5 times as large as that observed with conventional Pt/carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) catalyst. The results demonstrate that graphene serves as an excellent electrocatalytic carrier, and the supercritical fluid strategy is powerful and promising for the synthesis of highly active electrocatalysts for direct methanol fuel cells.

The effect of calcination conditions on the size and antibacterial activity of MgO nanoparticles was investigated. MgO nanoparticles were characterized for purity (TGA), crystallinity and crystal size (XRD), particle size and morphology (TEM) and surface area (BET). Results showed that the smallest size of 6 nm could be obtained. The lethal effects of nanocrystalline MgO were evaluated on Lactobacillus plantarum. At a concentration of 100 ppm, the killing effect of MgO was close to 1 log reduction for L. plantarum after 24 h exposure. At 1000 ppm and 24 h exposure, the killing effect of MgO was more than a 2.8 log reduction. With the increase of calcination time, the lethal effect of MgO nanoparticles increased after 6 h or 24 h exposure at 100 ppm or 1000 ppm. 2.86 log and 2.89 log were killed at 1000 ppm after 24 h exposure using the sample MgO, sonication, A, and the sample MgO, sonication, B, respectively. When the sample MgO, sonication, C, was used, the lethal quantity of L. plantarum was increased to a 3.36 log reduction.

J	Li, HM				Li Haiming			The Unorthodox Orthodox Christian: On the Religious Faith of Robert Frost	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Frost; religious faith; true life		Frost is an orthodox Christian but he said his religious faith was not orthodox. Thus, orthodox and unorthodox are contradictory and unified in the poet's thoughts and emotions: contradiction in how to understand God, and unification in Christianity including the rational cognition of God. This article holds the view that Frost puts emphasis on real life instead of the kingdom of Heaven. Frost's religious belief is the faith in the true life, in which people should determine their own destiny and should not put their hope on God and expect God to carry out justice and mercy on earth. However, his reality-affirming faith doesn't mean that he is opposed to Christian religion. What he really objects to is the fetishism and the illusory kingdom of heaven which are shown in two aspects: one is the failure to distinguish right from wrong, and the other the lack of concern about the true life. Actually, this point of view is the true understanding and awareness of the religious faith.

Methods The cytotoxicit of BaP and rat liver 59 (0.25 mg/mL)-activated BaP were examined by MU assay. Thoracic aortic rings were dissected from Sprague-Dawley rats. Contraction of aortic rings was induced by 60 mmol/L KCl or 10(-6) mol/L phenylephrine (PE) in an ex-vivo perfusion system after BaP (100 mu mol/L) incubation for 6 h. [Ca2+](i) was measured using Fluo-4/AM. For in-vivo treatment, rats were injected with BaP for 4 weeks (10 mg/kg, weekly, i.p.). Results BaP (1-500 mu m) did not significantly affect cell viability; S9-activated BaP stimulated cell proliferation. BaP did not affect the contractile function of endothelium-intact or -denuded aortic rings. BaP did not affect ATP-induced ([Ca2+](i)) increases in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In BaP-treated rats, heart rate and the number of circulating inflammatory cells were not affected. Body weight decreased while blood pressure increased significantly. The maximum aortic contractile responses to PE and KCl and the maximum aortic relaxation response to acetylcholine were significantly decreased by 25.0%, 34.2%, and 10.4%, respectively. Conclusion These results suggest, in accordance with its DNA-damaging properties, that metabolic activation is a prerequisite for BaP-induced cardiovascular toxicity.

However, for problems of large size, solving the linear system of equations exactly can be very expensive. In this paper, we propose a version of one of the non-interior continuation methods for monotone SDCP presented by Chen and Tseng that incorporates inexactness into the linear system solves. Only one system of linear equations is inexactly solved at each iteration. The global convergence and local superlinear convergence properties of the method are given under mild conditions.

In a two-party combined scheme, a single public key associated with two independent private keys and one escrow decryption key is provided. Any ciphertext encrypted under the public key can be simultaneously decrypted by the three keys. Meanwhile, the two private keys can also be used as signing keys to achieve non-repudiation service. We provide formal security definitions for two-party combined schemes, and present a simple and efficient scheme. Our construction is derived from bilinear pairings, and the security is based on the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (BDH) assumption.

Methods and Results: One hundred ten EST-SSRs were developed, and a set of 20 amplified two to six nucleotide repeats with a mean number of 2.5 alleles per locus and with an observed heterozygosity and polymorphism information content per locus ranging from 0.3463 to 0.9003 and 0.0997 to 0.6537 in 19 D. officinale genotypes, respectively. Furthermore, 92 of these markers have cross-taxa transferability, ranging from 6.45% to 100% among 30 other distantly related Dendrobium species. Conclusions: The developed markers have potential for application in germplasm appraisal, genetic diversity study, genetic mapping, and molecular breeding in D. officinale and other congeneric species.

In this manuscript, we demonstrate the remarkable ability of the secondary amine-functional polysiloxane to induce oxidative coupling in the copper-mediated Huisgen reactions of azides and alkynes, thereby achieving good yields and selectivities. The click reactions mediated by a polysiloxane-supported secondary amine allow the preparation of novel heterocyclic compounds, that is, bistriazoles. Comparably, it is also surprising that the use of a diamine-functional polysiloxane as ligand led to a classic Huisgen [3+2] cycloaddition in excellent yields. From the results of the present amine-functional polysiloxanes-controlled Huisgen reaction or oxidative Huisgen coupling reaction to divergent products and the proposed mechanism, we suggested that the mononuclear bistriazole-copper complex stabilized and dispersed by the secondary amine-functional polysiloxane was beneficial to prevalent the way to oxidative coupling.

By hooking up tetraphenylethene (TPE) units through aryl linkers under Suzuki coupling conditions, a series of arylene bis(tetraphenylethene)s (TPE-Ar-TPE Ar=2,5-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene, 2,5-bis(hexyloxyl)-1,4-phenylene, 1,5-naphthylene, and 9,10-anthracenylene) are prepared in satisfactory to high yields (67-96?%). These molecules are nonluminescent when dissolved in solutions but become highly emissive when aggregated in poor solvents or fabricated as thin film in the solid state, displaying a phenomenon of aggregation-induced emission. Fluorescence quantum yields of 100?% were achieved in the amorphous films of the luminogens. The luminogens exhibit mechano-, vapo-, and thermochromism: their emissions can be repeatedly switched between blue and blue-green colors by simple grinding-fuming and grinding-heating cycles owing to the morphological change from a crystalline to an amorphous state and vice versa. These compounds are thermally stable, losing little of their weight at high temperatures of 421-452 degrees C. All the luminogens are morphological stable with high glass transition temperatures. Multilayer light-emitting diodes with a device configuration of ITO/NPB/dye/TPBi/Alq3/LiF/Al are fabricated, which emit sky-blue electroluminescence with maximum luminance and external quantum efficiency of 7900 cd?m-2 and 2.1?%, respectively.

Here we confirm the existence of a critical imbalance in the ratio of Th17 to Treg-cell populations in peripheral CD4+ T cells from patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which favors inflammation. This was concurrent with increased IL-17 production from the CD4+CD45RA-FOXP3lo Treg-cell subset, and elevated osteopontin (OPN) levels in serum from ACS patients. We demonstrate a direct effect of OPN in serum from ACS patients on increased IL-17 production by CD4+CD45RA-FOXP3lo T cells, mediated through recruitment of the OPN receptors CD29 and CD44, and dependent on STAT3 and the nuclear hormone receptor retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor-?t (ROR?t) pathway, but not IL-6 production. To our knowledge and beyond the disease context of ACS, this study constitutes the first demonstration of a critical role for OPN in the positive regulation of inflammation through increased IL-17 production by CD4+CD45RA-FOXP3lo cells.

In addition, Hsp70 is also involved in regulation of innate and adaptive immune response. In this study, we examined the biological activity and the immunomodulatory property of an Hsp70 homologue, PoHsp70, from Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Recombinant PoHsp70 purified from Escherichia coli exhibits apparent ATPase activity; however, a mutant PoHsp70, PoHsp70M, that bears mutation of the ATPase-associated domain, was completely abolished in activity. Expression of PoHsp70 was upregulated in a time-dependent manner by vaccination of flounder with a DNA vaccine, pSia10. that expresses a Streptococcus iniae antigen, Sia10. To examine whether PoHsp70 possessed any adjuvant potential, the DNA vaccine plasmids pSia10Hsp70 and pSia10Hsp70M were constructed. pSia10Hsp70 co-expresses Sia10 and PoHsp70, while pSia10Hsp70M co-expresses Sia10 and PoHsp70M. Following vaccination of flounder, production of Sia10 plus PoHsp70 and Sia10 plus PoHsp70M was detected in pSia10Hsp70- and pSia10Hsp70M-vaccinated fish respectively. At one month post-vaccination, comparable levels of serum antibodies were detected in fish vaccinated with pSia10Hsp70, pSia10Hsp70M, and pSia10. Subsequent protection analysis showed that, followings. iniae challenge, pSia10Hsp70 induced a survival rate that was significantly higher than that induced by pSia10, while pSia10Hsp70M induced a survival rate similar to that induced by pSia10. These results indicate that PoHsp70 is an effective adjuvant and that the adjuvanticity of PoHsp70 requires the intrinsic ATPase activity. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The present study investigated whether individuals with low self-esteem would demonstrate greater reactivity to rejection-related stimuli during an attention shifting task than was exhibited by those with high self-esteem. Individuals with low self-esteem showed higher amplitude event-related potentials (ERPs) in response to rejection cues than was observed for those with high self-esteem. These results suggest that individuals with low self-esteem allocate more attentional resources to rejection cues than those with high self-esteem. Discussion will focus on the implications of these findings for understanding the connection between low self-esteem and social rejection. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The morphology and density of the nanowires can be easily tuned by changing the growth conditions. For example, isolated single nanowires were readily obtained by thermally depositing the BTPE on a heated substrate, while bundles of nanotubes can be achieved by slowly evaporating a droplet of the BTPE solution. The self-assembled BTPE nanowires show enhanced and blue-shifted photoluminescence compared with that of its amorphous film. The nanowires exhibit a highly hydrophobic surface with a water contact angle of 126 degrees. Also, the BTPE nanowires scatter the light effectively due to the random orientation of the wires. By depositing the BTPE nanowires on the backside of the glass substrate as a scattering media for organic light-emitting diodes, a 31.5% efficiency improvement has been achieved.

Despite substantial theoretical and practical achievements, unification and comparison of different approaches are lacking, which impedes further advances. In this article, we review recent developments in recommender systems and discuss the major challenges. We compare and evaluate available algorithms and examine their roles in the future developments. In addition to algorithms, physical aspects are described to illustrate macroscopic behavior of recommender systems. Potential impacts and future directions are discussed. We emphasize that recommendation has great scientific depth and combines diverse research fields which makes it interesting for physicists as well as interdisciplinary researchers.

Pb treatment induced rapid NO generation, showing that Pb exposure triggered endogenous NO signaling of the cells. Pre-treatment of the cells with the NO-specific scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline -1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) not only abolished the Pb-triggered NO burst but also reduced Pb contents of the cells. Moreover, Pb exposure enhanced nitrate reductase (NR) activity of the cells. The NR inhibitors tungstate and glutamine not only suppressed the Pb-enhanced NR activities but also reduced the Pb-triggered NO generation. Pre-treatment of the cells with tungstate and glutamine suppressed Pb accumulation and the suppression could be restored by application of exogenous NO via its donors sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO). Together, our results indicated that Pb exposure enhanced NR activity and triggered the NO burst of P. crinitum root cells. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that NR was responsible for the Pb-triggered NO burst and that NR-mediated NO generation played a critical role in Pb uptake by P. crinitum root cells. Thus, our results suggest a potential strategy for controlling Pb uptake by plants by targeting NR as a source of Pb-triggered NO production.

However, little information has been reported on the potential toxicity of organofluorine compounds to anaerobic digestion processes. In this work, the effects of 4-fluorophenol (p-FP), 4-fluorobenzoic acid (p-FB) and 4-fluoroaniline (p-FA) on methanogenesis and biodegradability were evaluated using sucrose-fed systems. RESULTS: The anaerobic biodegradation of three test compounds was not observed in the study. Adsorption of p-FP, p-FB and p-FA to the sludge fitted the linear model well (r2 > 0.94). The partition coefficient Kd was 25 L kg-1 for p-FP, 16 L kg-1 for p-FB and 26 L kg-1 for p-FA. Both methanogensis and hydrolysis acidification were inhibited in the presence of three test compounds. The half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50s) of methanogenic activity were 339, 1390 and 1907 mg L-1 for p-FP, p-FB and p-FA, respectively. A significant linear correlation (R2 = 0.99, P < 0.05) was obtained between the half maximal inhibitory concentrations and the most negative atomic charges of molecules (q-) of the three F-substituent aromatics. CONCLUSIONS: Three F-substituent aromatics had specific effects on methanogensis, hydrolysis acidification and syntrophic cooperation in anaerobic systems.

We collected these studies and conducted a meta-analysis to determine whether CartoMerge results in better procedural and clinical outcomes. Methods and Results: Three randomized controlled trials and two controlled observational studies were collected for analysis. The clinical and procedural outcomes of interest were AF recurrence after catheter ablation, major complications, procedure durations, and fluoroscopy time. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.0.18 software (The Cochrane Collaboration, Copenhagen, Denmark) and pooled estimates of effect were reported as risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CI). The overall results of this meta-analysis indicate that catheter ablation for AF guided by CartoMerge is insignificantly associated with a decreased risk of recurrences (RR = 0.76; 95% CI: 0.551.04; P = 0.09) and major complications (RR = 0.73; 95% CI: 0.371.45; P = 0.37) compared with that by Carto. Conclusion: The image integration using CartoMerge guiding catheter ablation for AF does not improve the main clinical outcomes significantly compared with that by Carto in centers with experienced operators.

The enantioseparation results of the two fungicides through three different cellulose-based chiral columns are discussed. The influence of column temperature on the resolution of the enantiomers of the two fungicides was examined. Complete enantioseparation of the two fungicides' enantiomers was obtained on a cellulose tris(4-methylbenzoate) column (Lux Cellulose-3) at 25 A degrees C using methanol and 0.1 % formic acid solution (80:20, v/v) as mobile phase. The linearity, matrix effect, recovery, and precision were evaluated. Good linearity was obtained over the concentration range of 1-500 mu g L-1 for each enantiomer in the standard solution and sample matrix calibration solution. There was no significant matrix effect in apple, grape, cucumber, or tomato samples, but signal suppression was typically observed with the soil extracts. The mean recoveries, repeatability, and reproducibility were 76.5-103 %, 2.1-9.0 %, and 4.2-11.8 %, respectively. The limit of quantification for enantiomers of the two fungicides in fruits, vegetables and soil was 5 mu g kg(-1). Moreover, the absolute configuration of the enantiomers of fenarimol and nuarimol was determined from a combination of experimentally determined and predicted electronic circular dichroism spectra.

Cells were divided into three groups. One group was exposed to Thi at various concentrations (0.00001 %similar to 0.001 %) for 30 min; the other two groups were pretreated with 0.3 % HA or 0.3 % HPMC for 30 min before the Thi exposure. After cell viability was evaluated, alkaline comet assay and detection of the phosphorylated form of the histone variant H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci were used to determine DNA damage. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by the fluorescent probe, 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA). A significant change of cell viability was observed after exposure to 0.001 % Thi for 30 min. DNA single- and double-strand breaks were significantly increased in a dose-dependent manner with Thi exposure. In addition, intracellular ROS induced by Thi was dose-dependent, except at 0.001 % less ROS was induced than at 0.0005 %. However, cells pretreated with 0.3 % HA or 0.3 % HPMC showed significantly increased cell survival, decreased DNA damage, and decreased ROS production compared to cells exposed to Thi alone. Pretreatment with 0.3 % HA was found to be even more protective than 0.3 % HPMC. Thi can induce DNA damage in human conjunctival epithelial cells, probably due to oxidative stress. HA and HPMC are protective agents that have antioxidant properties and can decrease DNA damage induced by Thi. Pretreatment of 0.3 % HA may be more protective of the ocular surface than 0.3 % HPMC.

In contrast, such a marker is lacking for expertise in reading Chinese, because the existing results about the lateralization of N170 for Chinese characters are mixed, reflecting complicated factors such as top-down modulation that contribute to the relative magnitudes of N170 in the left and right hemispheres. The present study aimed to explore a potential electrophysiological marker for reading expertise in Chinese with minimal top-down influence. We recorded N170 responses to Chinese characters and three kinds of control stimuli in a content-irrelevant task, minimizing potential top-down effects. Direct comparison of the N170 amplitude in response to Chinese characters between the hemispheres showed a marginally significant left-lateralization effect. However, detailed analyses of N170 in each hemisphere revealed a more robust pattern of left-lateralization - the N170 in the left but not the right hemisphere differentiated Chinese characters from control stimuli. These results suggest that the selectivity of N170 (a greater N170 in response to Chinese characters than to control stimuli) within the left hemisphere rather than the hemispheric difference of N170 with regard to Chinese characters is an electrophysiological marker for expertise in reading Chinese.

The mobile phase used for a reversed phase C-18 column was as follows: 2.0 mM tetraethylammonium hydroxide, 10 mM L-phenylalanine and 1% methanol (pH 8.9). Values of 1.5 mL min(-1) for the flow rate of the mobile phase and 25 degrees C for the column temperature were selected for rapid separation of iodine species. The detection limits for IO3-, I-, MIT and DIT were 0.061, 0.052, 0.079 and 0.24 mu g L-1, each, and the repeatabilities of peak height and peak area (20 mu g L-1 for iodide and iodate, 40 mu g L-1 for MIT, 100 mu g L-1 for DIT) were all lower than 4%. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was successfully applied for the speciation analysis of iodine in seaweed and seawater samples. Recoveries of IO3,- I-, MIT and DIT in seaweed and seawater samples were between 90 and 110%. All results prove its advantages including high sensitivity, environmentally friendly, low time consumption, which are beneficial for routine analysis of iodine speciation in environmental and food fields.

J	Shao, ZH				Shao, Zuhua			Verifiably encrypted short signatures from bilinear maps	ANNALS OF TELECOMMUNICATIONS-ANNALES DES TELECOMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Verifiably encrypted signature; Short signature; Fair exchange; Random oracle model	IDENTITY-BASED ENCRYPTION; OPTIMISTIC FAIR EXCHANGE; RANDOM ORACLES; DIGITAL-SIGNATURES; AGGREGATE SIGNATURES; EXACT SECURITY; SCHEME; MODEL	In 2003, Boneh et al. proposed the first efficient verifiably encrypted signature scheme (BGLS) from bilinear maps, which can be used in fair exchange protocols of short signatures. However, there are two weaknesses in the scheme. The security proof is built on a weaker security model, in which the key pair of the adjudicator is chosen by the simulator instead of the signature forger. The other is that the ordinary signatures to be verifiably encrypted are deterministic. They suffer from strong collision attacks of hash functions. In this paper, we propose an enhanced verifiably encrypted short signature scheme. The new scheme is strongly unforgeable in the random oracle model under a stronger security model, where two inside adversaries, malicious adjudicator and malicious verifier, have more power than ever. The new scheme would tally with the actual circumstances of electronic commerce.

Bladder overdistention was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats (200-250 g) by an infusion of saline. Forty rats were divided into 5 groups submitted to different DOD, i.e., 1, 2, 4, and 8 h, and control. Bladder function was evaluated by cystometry. Morphological changes were observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Compared to control (44.567 +/- 3.472 cmH(2)O), the maximum detrusor pressure of groups with 2-, 4- and 8-h DOD decreased significantly (means +/- SEM): 32.774 +/- 3.726, 31.321 +/- 2.847, and 29.238 +/- 3.724 cmH(2)O. With the increase of DOD, inflammatory infiltration and impairment of ultrastructure were more obvious in bladder tissue. Compared to control (1.90 +/- 0.77), the apoptotic indexes of groups with 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-h DOD increased significantly (6.47 +/- 2.10, 10.66 +/- 1.97, 13.91 +/- 2.69, and 18.33 +/- 3.28%). Compared to control (0.147 +/- 0.031/0.234 +/- 0.038 caspase 3/beta-actin and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios), both caspase 3/beta-actin and Bax/Bcl-2 ratios of 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-h DOD increased significantly (0.292 +/- 0.037/0.508 +/- 0.174, 0.723 +/- 0.173/1.745 +/- 0.471, 1.104 +/- 0.245/4.000 +/- 1.048, and 1.345 +/- 0.409/8.398 +/- 3.332). DOD plays an important role in impairment of vesical function and structure. With DOD, pro-apoptotic factors increase and anti-apoptotic factors decrease, possibly contributing to the functional deterioration and morphological changes of the bladder.

Combinative energy between two structural blocks and superconductivity in LaFe1-xCoxAsO	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Superconductor; Structural block; Combinative energy	43 K	The cohesive energy of the whole cell and the combinative energy between the Fe-As block and the La-O block in LaFe1-xCoxAsO were calculated using a block model. A relationship between the combinative energy and T-c is found similar to the previous reports in SmOFeAs systems to some extent. Remarkably, the combinative energy in LaFe1-xCoxAsO appears nearly unchanged regardless of the positions we locate electron at the Fe, As site or at the centre of the Fe-As layer, which further confirms an itinerant character in LaFe1-xCoxAsO. In addition, the relationship between the combinative energy and T-c is also extended to the whole LnOFeAsF(Ln=Ln=a, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd) systems and the relationship can be well explained with the charge-transfer model.

Total OCPs concentrations in water column and SPM ranges from 2.88 to 34.72 ng/L and 2.47 to 29.94 ng/L, respectively, which exceed the US Environmental Protection Agency regulatory limits. Moreover, low ratio of alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH and high ratios beta- and gamma-HCH suggested the cocktail input pattern of fresh and weathered HCHs. Meanwhile, low ratio of (DDE + DDD)/DDT and high ratios p,p'- and o,p'-DDT reflected a "dicofol type DDT pollution" pattern.

Most estrogens species, except estrone, were not detected by the chemical analysis using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. The concentration of estrone in the samples ranged from ND (below the detection limit) to 17.25 ng/L. The estrogen activity in most water samples was also determined by the yeast estrogen screen. The 17 beta-estradiol equivalent in the intake of Taihu Lake was 17.60 ng/L and was present in all water samples. This study demonstrates that combining chemical and bioassay analysis is an effective way to detect environmental contamination by estrogen species. Furthermore, the results indicate that the risk of estrogen contamination in the Tiaoxi River should not be ignored.

In the first stage, i.e., the pre-learning stage, a focal player decides whether to update his strategy according to the pre-learning factor beta and the payoff difference between himself and the average of his neighbors. If the player makes up his mind to update, he enters into the second stage, i.e., the learning stage, and adopts a strategy of a randomly selected neighbor according to the standard Fermi updating rule. The simulation results show that the cooperation level has a non-trivial dependence on the pre-learning factor. Generally, the cooperation frequency decreases as the pre-learning factor increases; but a high cooperation level can be obtained in the intermediate region of -3 < beta < -1. We then give some explanations via studying the co-action of pre-learning and learning. Our results may sharpen the understanding of the influence of the strategy updating rule on evolutionary games.

The paper presents data of PCBs concentrations in fifty surface sediment samples and a dated sediment core in Yangtze River Delta (YRE) and adjacent East China Sea (ECS). The total PCBs levels varied from 5.08 to 19.64 ng/g dry weight, with the highest concentrations situate within the river-sea boundary zone which is so-called "marginal filter". Concurrent with the operation of e-waste recycling over the last two decades, PCB fluxes started to rise again after 1980s and reached a maximum in this century. The full data set was used to estimate the burden of PCBs in YRE and adjacent ECS.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of e(+)e(-) -> eta J/psi at center-of-mass energy root s=4.009 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using a 478 pb(-1) data sample collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider storage ring at a center-of-mass energy of root s = 4.009 GeV, the production of e(+)e(-) -> eta J/psi is observed for the first time with a statistical significance of greater than 10 sigma. The Born cross section is measured to be (32.1 +/- 2.8 +/- 1.3) pb, where the first error is statistical and the second systematic. Assuming the eta J/psi signal is from a hadronic transition of the psi(4040), the fractional transition rate is determined to be B(psi(4040) -> eta J/psi) = (5.2 +/- 0.5 +/- 0.2 +/- 0.5) x 10(-3), where the first, second, and third errors are statistical, systematic, and the uncertainty from the psi(4040) resonant parameters, respectively. The production of e(+)e(-) -> pi(0)J/psi is searched for, but no significant signal is observed, and B(psi(4040) -> pi(0)J/psi) < 2.8 x 10(-4) is obtained at the 90% confidence level.

TOMATO DC3000; DISEASE RESISTANCE; HYPERSENSITIVE-RESPONSE; SECRETORY PATHWAY; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; DISULFIDE-ISOMERASE; MEDIATED RESISTANCE; XANTHOMONAS-ORYZAE; UNFOLDED PROTEINS	The hypersensitive response (HR), a form of programmed cell death (PCD), is a tightly regulated innate immune response in plants that is hypothesized to restrict pathogen growth and disease development. Although considerable efforts have been made to understand HR PCD, it remains unknown whether the retrograde pathway from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is involved. Here we provide direct genetic evidence that two Nicotiana benthamiana homologs, ERD2a and ERD2b, function as ER luminal protein receptors and participate in HR PCD. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of ERD2a and/or ERD2b caused escape of ER-resident proteins from the ER, and resulted in plants that were more sensitive to ER stress. Silencing of ERD2b delayed HR PCD induced by the non-host pathogens Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae and Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000. However, both silencing of ERD2a and co-silencing of ERD2a and ERD2b exacerbated HR PCD. Individual and combined suppression of ERD2a and ERD2b exaggerated R gene-mediated cell death. Nevertheless, silencing of ERD2a and/or ERD2b had no detectable effects on bacterial growth. Furthermore, VIGS of several putative ligands of ERD2a/2b, including the ER quality control (ERQC) component genes BiP, CRT3 and UGGT, had different effects on HR PCD induced by different pathogens. This indicates that immunity-related cell death pathways are separate with respect to the genetic requirements for these ERQC components. These results suggest that ERD2a and ERD2b function as ER luminal protein receptors to ensure ERQC and alleviate ER stress, thus affecting HR PCD during the plant innate immune response.

Material and Methods: A431 OSCC in vitro were exposed to 0 mu M, 0.5 mu M, 2.5 mu M, or 5 mu M of As2O3 for 0 h, 24 h, 48 h and 72 h. Confocal microscopy and flow cytometry confirmed EGFR expression and demonstrated a sensitivity dose-related signal decline with As2O3 treatment. Next, mice with pharynx-implanted A431 cells received As2O3 i.p. every 48 h at 0.0, 0.5, 2.5, or 5 mg/kg/day (n = 6/group) from day 0 to 10. An intravenous NIR probe, EGF-Cy5.5, was injected at baseline and on days 4, 8, and 12 for dynamic NIR imaging. Tumor volume and body weights were measured three times weekly. Results: In vitro, A431 EGFR expression was well appreciated in the controls and decreased (p<0.05) with increasing As2O3 dose and treatment duration. In vivo EGFR NIR tumor signal intensity decreased (p<0.05) in As2O3 treated groups versus controls from days 4 to 12, consistent with increasing dosage. Tumor volume diminished in a dose-related manner while body weight was unaffected. Immunohistochemical staining of excised tumors confirmed that EGFR expression was reduced by As2O3 treatment in a dose responsive pattern. Conclusion: This study demonstrates for the first time that OSCC can be interrogated in vivo by NIR molecular imaging of the EGFR and that this biomarker is effective for the longitudinal assessment of OSCC response to As2O3 treatment.

Transient quantum transport in double-dot Aharonov-Bohm interferometers	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							OSCILLATIONS; COHERENCE; RING	Real-time nonequilibrium quantum dynamics of electrons in double-dot Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interferometers is studied using an exact solution of the master equation. The building of the coherence between the two electronic paths shows up via the time-dependent amplitude of the AB oscillations in the transient transport current and can be enhanced by varying the applied bias on the leads, the on-site energy difference between the dots and the asymmetry of the coupling of the dots to the leads. The transient oscillations of the transport current do not obey phase rigidity. The circulating current has an antisymmetric AB oscillation in the flux. The nondegeneracy of the on-site energies and the finite bias cause the occupation in each dot to have an arbitrary flux dependence as the coupling asymmetry is varied.

J	Jiang, HM				Jiang, Hong-Min			Theory of the interplay between the superconductivity and the blocked antiferromagnetic order in A(y)Fe(2-x)Se(2)	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article								Based on an effective two-orbital tight-binding model, we examine the possible superconducting states in iron-vacancy-ordered A(y)Fe(2-x)Se(2). In the presence of ordered vacancies and blocked antiferromagnetic order, it is shown that the emergent SC pairing is the nodeless next-nearest-neighbor (NNN)-pairing due to the dominant antiferromagnetic (AFM) interaction between the inter-block NNN sites. In particular, we show that due to the ordered vacancies and the associated blocked AFM order, the interplay between the superconducting and AFM states results in three distinct states in the phase diagram as doping is varied. The divergent experimental observations can be accounted for by considering the different charge carrier concentrations in their respective compounds.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of chi(cj) decaying into p(n)over-bar pi(-) and p(n)over-bar pi(-)pi(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							COLOR OCTET CONTRIBUTION; WAVE CHARMONIUM DECAY	Using a data sample of 1.06 x 10(8) psi' events collected with the BESIII detector in 2009, the branching fractions of chi(cJ) -> p (n) over bar pi(-) and chi(cJ) -> p (n) over bar pi(-)pi(0) (J = 0, 1, 2) are measured. (Throughout the text, inclusion of charge conjugate modes is implied if not stated otherwise.) The results for chi(c0) -> p (n) over bar pi(-) and chi(c2) -> p (n) over bar pi(-) are consistent with, but much more precise than, those of previous measurements. The decays of chi(c1) -> p (n) over bar pi(-) and chi(cJ) -> p (n) over bar pi(-)pi(0) are observed for the first time.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J.

The cognitive division of anterior cingulate cortex (ACC-cd) is a commonly reported abnormal brain region in schizophrenia for its importance in cognitive control process. The aim of this study was to investigate the functional and anatomical connectivity of ACC-cd and its cognitive and clinical manifestation significance in schizophrenia by using the resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Methods: Thirty-three medicated schizophrenics and 30 well-matched health controls were recruited. Region-of-interest (ROI)-based resting-state functional connectivity analysis and Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) were performed on 30 patients and 30 controls, and 24 patients and 29 controls, respectively. The Pearson correlation was performed between the imaging measures and the Stroop performance and scores of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), respectively. Results: Patients with schizophrenia showed significantly abnormal in the functional connectivity and its hemispheric asymmetry of the ACC-cd with multiple brain areas, e. g., decreased positive connectivity with the bilateral putamen and caudate, increased negative connectivity with the left posterior cingulated cortex (PCC), increased asymmetry of connectivity strength with the contralateral inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). The FA of the right anterior cingulum was significantly decreased in patients group (p = 0.014). The abnormal functional and structural connectivity of ACC-cd were correlated with Stroop performance and the severity of the symptoms in patients. Conclusions: Our results suggested that the abnormal connectivity of the ACC-cd might play a role in the cognitive impairment and clinical symptoms in schizophrenia.

Can these localized activations, or others, predict long-term relationship stability? We contacted participants from a previous fMRI study of early-stage love by Xu et al. [34] after 40 months from initial assessments. We compared brain activation during the initial assessment at early-stage love for those who were still together at 40 months and those who were apart, and surveyed those still together about their relationship happiness and commitment at 40 months. Six participants who were still with their partners at 40 months (compared to six who had broken up) showed less activation during early-stage love in the medial orbitofrontal cortex, right subcallosal cingulate and right accumbens, regions implicated in long-term love and relationship satisfaction [1,2]. These regions of deactivation at the early stage of love were also negatively correlated with relationship happiness scores collected at 40 months. Other areas involved were the caudate tail, and temporal and parietal lobes. These data are preliminary evidence that neural responses in the early stages of romantic love can predict relationship stability and quality up to 40 months later in the relationship. The brain regions involved suggest that forebrain reward functions may be predictive for relationship stability, as well as regions involved in social evaluation, emotional regulation, and mood.

Depinning phase transition in the two-dimensional clock model with quenched randomness	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							DOMAIN-WALL CREEP; FIELD ISING-MODEL; DYNAMICS; BEHAVIOR; SYSTEMS; GROWTH; MOTION	With Monte Carlo simulations, we systematically investigate the depinning phase transition in the two-dimensional driven random-field clock model. Based on the short-time dynamic approach, we determine the transition field and critical exponents. The results show that the critical exponents vary with the form of the random-field distribution and the strength of the random fields, and the roughening dynamics of the domain interface belongs to the new subclass with. zeta not equal zeta(loc) not equal zeta(s) and zeta(loc) not equal 1. More importantly, we find that the transition field and critical exponents change with the initial orientations of the magnetization of the two ordered domains.	[Qin, X.

For instance, individuals become more and more weak with age, while young individuals may prosper even under poor living conditions. In this paper, we find that aging as a coevolutionary process promotes cooperation more effectively than quenched heterogeneous distributions of age. By studying the average age of defectors and cooperators along the boundaries separating the domains of the two strategies, we reveal the significance of coevolutionary rules for the successful evolution of cooperation amongst selfish and unrelated individuals.

The spin-orbit-coupling effect is significant in LaPt3P but negligible in CaPt3P and SrPt3P. Moreover, SrPt3P has been demonstrated to exhibit an unexpected weak charge-density-wave (CDW) instability, which is related neither directly to the Fermi-surface nesting nor to the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling alone. The instability is absent in CaPt3P and can be quickly suppressed by the external pressure, accompanied with decreases in the phonon softening and BCS T-c. Our results suggest SrPt3P as a rare example where superconductivity is enhanced by the CDW fluctuations.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of chi(cJ) decays to Lambda(Lambda)over-bar pi(+)pi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Decays of the chi(cJ) states (J = 0, 1, 2) to Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(+)pi(-), including processes with intermediate Sigma(1385), are studied through the E1 transition psi(1) -> gamma chi(cJ) using 106 x 10(6) psi(1) events collected with the BESIII detector at BEPCII. This is the first observation of chi(cJ) decays to the final state Lambda(Lambda) over bar pi(+)pi(-). The branching ratio of the intermediate process chi(cJ) -> (Sigma) over bar (1385)(+/-) (Sigma) over bar (1385)(-/+) is also measured for the first time, and the results agree with the theoretical predictions based on the color-octet effect.

Combined with the 8-way multifunctional valve used in flow injection analysis, the introduction of sub-microlitre sample in inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry(ICP-MS) was realized. 52% ethanol was used to simulate the distilled spirit. The effects of the volume of the 52% ethanol introduced into ICP-MS on ICP stability and the spectral interference from the spirit matrix were studied. The relationship between the sampling volume and sensitivity was evaluated. The carrier flow rate was optimized. The experimental results showed that neither alteration of plasma stability nor carbon deposition was observed when the sampling volume of 52% ethanol reduced down to 0.8 mu L. Further reducing the sampling volume to 0.3 mu L, the interference from carbon was eliminated. Based on these observations, a microflow injection method for the determination of lead and cadmium in distilled spirits by ICP-MS via external aqueous calibration was developed. The sample throughput was 45 h(-1) with the detection limits of 12 and 42 ng/L for Pb and Cd, respectively. The contents of Cd and Pb in six distilled spirits were measured. The results agreed well with those determined by ICP-MS with the conventional sampling system after microwave assisted digestion.

IR fiber optics possesses high performance which can be applied to transmission of IR light. The coupled technique of FTIR and mid-IR fiber optics can simplify the sample preparation in traditional IR spectroscopy. Formation of new compound is observed in situ and reaction process can be monitored on line using FTIR fiber optics technique. In this study, mid-IR fiber optics technique was applied to liquid phase systems and solid/liquid reaction systems. In the liquid phase system, we investigated the saponification reaction of naphthenic acid-octal alcohol-heptane and the formation mechanism of water in oil(w/o) microemulsion during saponification. The interaction between naphthenic acid and octal alcohol was observed. With adding ammonium hydroxide, the peak around 1708 cm(-1) disappeared and the peak at 1548 cm(-1) enhanced and the peak position of water emerged and shifted to 1637 cm(-1) from 1642 cm(-1), which is the position of water molecule in IR spectroscopy. It showed that water is constrained in aqueous droplet of naphthenic acid-octal alcohol-heptane and microemulsion is formed through the saponification. In the solid/liquid reaction system, complexation reaction between o-phthalic acid and europium chloride was investigated. The interaction between o-phthalic acid and EuCl3 in neural medium was ignored in previous study, but this weak interaction was observed using FTIR fiber optics technique in our present investigation. The results showed that the component and structure of the final complex were effect by the difference of adding sequence. Therefore, FTIR fiber optics technique may become a new method of monitoring chemical reaction in real time.

The results show that the solubility of 1,3-dimethyl-1,1,3,3-tetraphenyldisiloxane in the five solvents increases with increasing temperature. Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane is the most suitable solvent for crystallization of 1,3-dimethyl-1,1,3,3-tetraphenyldisiloxane from solution. The experimental solubility data were correlated by the modified Apelblat equation, the van't Hoff plot, and lambda h (Buchowski) equation.

Currently available synthetic routes for these heterocyclic compounds have limited scope owing to the harsh reaction conditions, low yields, and multistep process. Herein, we reported a practical method for synthesis of alkyl-, alcohol-, amine-, and ester-extended tosylpiperazines under mild conditions with moderate to high yields. This protocol exhibits potential applicability in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and natural products because of the operational simplicity and the conveniently available reactants. On the basis of the experimental and theoretical results, a plausible mechanism of aliphatic nucleophilic substitution (S-N) in the cyclization has been postulated and evidence for the formation of a six-membered ring has also been confirmed by means of density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

The organocatalyst 2b was found to be an efficient organocatalyst for the asymmetric aldol reaction in water. This organocatalyst is applicable to the reactions of a wide range of aromatic aldehydes with cyclic and acyclic ketones in high yields (up to 98%). These reactions exhibit high anti/syn ratios (up to 99%) and excellent enantioselectivities (up to 99%). Importantly, the catalyst can be easily recovered and recycled with only a slight decrease in enantioselectivity after five cycles. Crown Copyright (C) 2012 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Magnetic phase diagram in the Co-rich side of the LCo1-xFexAsO (L = La, Sm) system	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY	The magnetic phase diagram has been mapped out via the measurements of electronic resistivity, magnetization, and specific heat in the cobalt-based layered LCo1-xFexAsO (L = La, Sm) compounds. The ferromagnetic (FM) transition at similar to 63 K for LaCoAsO is rapidly suppressed upon Fe doping, and ultimately disappears around x = 0.3 in the LaCo1-xFex AsO system. When La is replaced by magnetic rare-earth element Sm, the 3d electrons first undergo a FM transition at T-c similar to 75 K, followed by an antiferromagnetic (AFM) transition at a lower temperature T-N1 similar to 45 K. With partial Fe doping on the Co site, both FM (T-c) and AFM (T-N1) transition temperatures are significantly suppressed, and finally approach 0 K at x = 0.3 and 0.2, respectively. Meanwhile, a third magnetic transition at T-N2 similar to 5.6 K for SmCoAsO, associated with the AFM order of the Sm3+ 4f moments, is uncovered and T-N2 is found to be almost robust against the small Fe doping. These results suggest that the 4f electrons of Sm3+ have an important effect on the magnetic behavior of 3d electrons in the 1111 type Co-based LCo1-xFexAsO systems. In contrast, the magnetism of the f electrons is relatively unaffected by the variation of the 3d electrons. The rich magnetic phase diagram in the Co-rich side of the LCo1-xFex AsO system, therefore, is established.	[Li, Y. K.; Xu, X.

Bremsstrahlung simulation in K -> pi l(+/-)nu(l)(gamma) decays	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							QED RADIATIVE-CORRECTIONS; UNIVERSAL MONTE-CARLO; PHOTOS; TAUOLA; TOOL; NLO	In physics simulation chains, the PHOTOS Monte Carlo program is often used to simulate QED effects in decays of intermediate particles and resonances. The program is based on an exact multiphoton phase space. In general, the matrix element is obtained from iterations of a universal kernel and approximations are involved. To evaluate the program's precision, it is necessary to formulate and implement within the generator the exact matrix element, which depends on the decay channel. Then, all terms necessary for non-leading logarithms are taken into account. In the present letter we focus on the decay K -> pi l(+/-)nu(l) and tests of the PHOTOS Monte Carlo program. We conclude that there is a 0.2 % relative precision in the implementation of the hard photon matrix element into the emission kernel, including the case where approximations are used.

Zhejiang University School of Medicine, China-Background: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have many potential applications, including as delivery systems for a variety of diagnostic or therapeutic agents. However, it has been suggested that exposure to carbon nano-materials may be a risk for the development of vascular diseases due to its impact on the vascular endothelium. Materials and Methods: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (180-200 g) were used to generate an atherosclerosis (AS) model, and the effect of intravenous administration of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) on AS was studied. To further understand the underlying mechanisms, the effects of exposure of human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) to MWCNTs were examined. Results: Exposure to 200 mu g/kg MWCNTs aggravated AS in this model. In addition, exposure to 50, 100 and 200 mu g/kg MWCNTs increased the calcification of the aorta in the model. Short-term exposure also revealed that 200 mu g/kg MWCNTs injured the endothelium in the aorta. MWCNTs disrupted the endothelial tight junction and induced endothelial cell death. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that MWCNTs could induce structural and functional changes in the endothelium, probably through vascular endotheliocyte injury, which eventually affected the development of AS in SD rats.

Currently, no data have explored the potential for CTX to provide neuroprotection in the animal models of traumatic brain injury (TBI). The aim of this study was to investigate the neuroprotective effect by CTX on TBI and to determine the underlying mechanisms. METHODS: Rats were immediately subjected to a lateral cortical impact injury caused by a free-falling object and divided randomly into three groups: sham-operated, trauma, and trauma + CTX treatment group. The CTX treatment group was given CTX (200 mg/kg of body weight, intravenously) immediately after injury. The cognitive function was assessed by Y-maze testing and cerebral edema was evaluated. Inflammatory cytokines expression was measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay array. The expression of glutamate transporter-1 protein was identified by Western blot analysis. RESULTS: This study shows that the CTX causes attenuation of TBI-induced cerebral edema and cognitive function deficits. CTX treatment significantly reduced levels of the proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha and upregulated glutamate transporter-1 expression after TBI. CONCLUSION: Our results provide in vivo evidence that CTX could exert neuroprotective effect against TBI by improving cognitive function and alleviating brain edema via reducing excitotoxicity and inflammation after TBI.

This proposal does not require adjustment of the qnbit level spacings or identical qubit-cavity coupling constants. Moreover, since only a resonant interaction is applied, the gate can be performed fast, within similar to 10 nanosecond. This proposal is quite general, which can be applied to various types of superconducting qubits, atoms trapped in a cavity, or quantum dots coupled to a resonator.

Observations from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) showed that the amplified exponential growth of the multilayers could induce distinguishable, hierarchical micro- and nanostructures simultaneously. This growth caused the surface roughness to amplify in a lotus-leaf-like manner. UV/visible spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the formation of well-dispersed Ag-0 nanoparticles (with sizes from 4-6 nm) in the films. SEM and fluorescence microscope images of the exposed surfaces revealed that the pattern of adhesion and the density of bacterial cells differed depending on the surface energy and the number of Ag+ ions released during the various immersion time periods. The complementary effects of nanosilver and superhydrophobic coatings can help to effectively reduce bacterial adhesion and the formation of biofilms.

Its feasibility is proved by the Lasalle principle. Numerical simulation results show that synaptic connection weight can converge to an appropriate strength and the identical network comes to synchronization. Furthermore, by this approach of learning, a non-identical neural population can still reach synchronization. This means that the learning rule has robustness on mismatch parameters. The firing rhythm of the neural population is totally dependent on topological properties, which promotes our understanding of neuron population activities.

In Hangzhou, China, 861 students aged 13.68 +/- 1.03 years were randomly recruited to carry out a cross-sectional, school-based survey. The design of the survey questionnaire was based on the Transtheoretical Model (TTM) of Behavior Change. Results of the survey rated FV consumption and children's readiness to assume healthier dietary choices. The study design incorporated the four core constructs of TTM: stages of change, processes of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy. Results were assessed by chi-square tests, analysis of variance, Tukey's post-hoc tests and logistic regression analysis. Majority of the participants were in the TTM contemplation stage of change. The average number of FV servings among participants was 3.12 +/- 1.41 per day. The specific process of change, number of decisional balance pros (as opposed to cons), and self-efficacy ratings were positively correlated with stage of change transition (Spearman r > 0, P < 0.01). Stage transition, higher scores on self-efficacy and lower scores on cons predicted higher FV consumption (beta > 0, P < 0.05). The use of TTM may be a powerful personalized means of decreasing poor dietary behaviors and promoting healthy behaviors, compared to traditional methods of behavioral change.

Electronic databases were accessed and papers were found by keyword search. A total of 132 Chinese and 9 English papers were catalogued for review. These papers address migrant maternity issues concerning antenatal, intrapartum, postnatal care, institutional issues, family planning or birth control. Since China's economic reforms, the healthcare infrastructure has been inadequate for childbirth in migrants. They experience more adverse birth outcomes than local residents. This suggests that the effects of change upon childbirth and the existing urban and rural care systems cannot meet the needs of the migrants. There is a lack of research in the childbirth experience of women. Knowledge of their childbirth experience will contribute to the understanding of these needs, informing systems' reform. The medical approach results in many unnecessary interventions and higher costs. It is argued here that a midwifery model of care is most appropriate for the childbirth experience of migrant women.

The assay was performed on an uncoated fused-silica capillary of 95 cm x 50 mm I. D. and a positive voltage of 27 kV was applied. The sample was injected under pressure of 50 mbar for 3-300 s and the temperature of capillary was kept 25 degrees C. Sheath liquid constituted of 5 mM ammonium acetate in methanol solution, flowing at 4 mu L min(-1), and was supplied to the CE-electrospray interface. The effects of nebulizer gas pressure, the flow rate and temperature of the drying gas, sheath liquid composition and flow rate, and sample injection length were optimized in order to obtain better performance. Utilizing the preconcentration technique, the sensitivity was enhanced by approximately 30-50 fold in terms of limits of detection compared to common hydrodynamic injection without interference from matrix coextractives. The phenolic antioxidant abilities were also determined by simple and accurate free radical spiking test. Furthermore, the method has been successfully applied to a danshen sample.

CYPERACEAE; TRIBE CARICEAE; SUPRAGENERIC PHYLOGENY; RBCL; REGION; CIRCUMSCRIPTION; MAPANIOIDEAE; ERIOPHORUM	Erioscirpus (Cyperaceae) is distributed mainly in the Himalayas, comprising two species: E. comosus and E. microstachyus. Recent authors have not recognized Erioscirpus as a distinct genus, but included it either in Eriophorum or Trichophorum, and always placed in tribe Scirpeae. However, as past authors have previously noted, Erioscirpus is quite different from Eriophorum and Trichophorum in some morphological features and in ecological preferences. In this study, we aimed to clarify the phylogenetic position of Erioscirpus using plastid and nuclear DNA sequence data for E. comosus from Nepal and Myanmar and E. microstachyus from India. We found that Erioscirpus was nested in tribe Cypereae, among the Ficinia clade with Dracoscirpoides, Ficinia, Hellmuthia, Isolepis and Scirpoides, which are predominantly distributed in the Mediterranean zones of the Southern Hemisphere. In contrast, Eriophorum and Trichophorum formed a clade with members of the tribes Cariceae, Dulichieae or Scirpeae, which are mainly distributed in the Holarctic zones of the Northern Hemisphere. It is thought that the common character, cotton-like long perianth bristles, shared by Erioscirpus, Eriophorum and Trichophorum, has evolved independently several times as a mechanism promoting wind dispersal.

In the presence of supercritical carbon dioxide, PtRu alloy nanoparticles are decorated evenly on functionalized graphene sheets (FGSs) upon the reduction of organic platinum (II) and ruthenium (III) precursors, and its application as an electrocatalyst for methanol oxidation is studied. Transmission electron microscopy observation shows that highly dispersed PtRu metallic nanoparticles with an average size of about 3.11 nm are uniformly and densely distributed on the hydrophobic surface of FGSs. X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrate that the particles had a face-centered cubic crystal structure, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicates the existence of zero-valence metals. Compared with the widely used Vulcan XC-72 carbon black, the PtRu/FGS composites exhibit superior catalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation. The huge surface area of graphene and uniform distribution of nanosized metal particles are two critical factors for the significantly enhanced electrocatalytic efficiency. The findings suggest that the supercritical fluid method is highly efficient in preparing graphene-supported metallic catalysts, and FGSs serve as a favorable electrocatalytic carrier for direct methanol fuel cells.

The function of microRNA-99a (miR-99a) in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) remains unclear. In the present study, we investigated the roles of miR-99a in OSCC development and the underlying mechanisms in 25 cases of primary OSCC tissues and Tca-8113 cells. The cells were analyzed using FACS analysis and western blotting. Results showed that the expression levels of miR-99a were markedly decreased in OSCC tissues compared with the adjacent non-tumor tissues (n=25). The results of in vitro experiments showed that miR-99a mimics significantly inhibited the proliferation of Tca-8113 cells, a tongue squamous carcinoma cell I me, and that miR-99a mimics markedly induced the apoptosis of Tca-8113 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) was directly targeted by miR-99a, as the overexpression of miR-99a in Tca-8113 cells downregulated the protein expression level of mTOR. Thus, our findings suggest that the downregulation of miR-99a in OSCC tissues is associated with tumor development. miR-99a regulates the growth and survival of OSCC cells and may be exploited as a biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with OSCC.

J	Hu, YH; Dang, W; Sun, L				Hu, Yong-hua; Dang, Wei; Sun, Li			A TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor of Pseudomonas fluorescens: virulence and vaccine potential	ARCHIVES OF MICROBIOLOGY			English	Article						Pseudomonas fluorescens; TonB-dependent receptor; Virulence; Vaccine	EDWARDSIELLA-TARDA; HEMOGLOBIN RECEPTOR; CONFERS PROTECTION; SWINE MODEL; IMMUNIZATION; INFECTION; TRANSPORT; ADJUVANT; HGBA	Pseudomonas fluorescens is a Gram-negative bacterium and a common aquaculture pathogen. In this study, we identified from a pathogenic P. fluorescens strain a TonB-dependent outer membrane receptor, TdrA, as a secreted protein and examined its function and vaccine potential. TdrA is composed of 746 residues and possesses conserved structural domains of TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors. Quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis showed that expression of tdrA was upregulated under conditions of iron starvation and during infection of host cells. Consistently, iron depletion induced increased production of TdrA protein in the outer membrane. Compared to the wild type, a tdrA-knock out mutant (1) was unable to grow in the absence of iron, (2) exhibited drastically attenuated overall bacterial virulence, and (3) was impaired in the ability to establish lethal infection in host tissues. Purified recombinant TdrA (rTdrA), when used as a subunit vaccine to immunize flounder, was able to induce strong protective immunity, including production of serum-specific antibodies that resulted in effective protection against lethal-dose P. fluorescens challenge. Together, these results indicate that TdrA is an outer membrane receptor and a protective immunogen that is likely to be involved in iron acquisition and, as a result, required for optimal bacterial virulence.

During the overloads, the nitrogen removal rate improved, and the shock period was an important factor affecting the reactor performance. In the high pH condition, the reactor performance significantly degenerated; while in the low pH condition, it did not happen. The NaCI addition caused the most serious deterioration in the reactor, which took 108 h to recover and was accompanied by a stoichiometric ratio divergence. There are well correlations between the total nitrogen and the electrical conductivity which is considered to be a convenient signal for controlling and monitoring the ANAMMOX process under transient-state conditions.

Firstly, by establishing the differential equation of motion for the systems and introducing a one-parameter infinitesimal transformation group together with its infinitesimal generator vector, the determining equation of conformal invariance for the systems are provided, and the conformal factors expression are deduced. Secondly, the relation between conformal invariance and the Lie symmetry by the infinitesimal one-parameter point transformation group for the higher-order holonomic systems are deduced. Thirdly, the conserved quantities of the systems are derived using the structure equation satisfied by the gauge function. Lastly, an example of a higher-order holonomic mechanical system is discussed to illustrate these results.

In this study, the plasma-sprayed Al2O3-13wt.%TiO2/NiCrAl coatings were annealed at 300-900 A degrees C for 6 h in vacuum. The tensile bond strength and porosity of the coatings were investigated. The microstructure and the fracture were studied using optical microscopy, scanning electron spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. It was found that the tensile bond strength of coatings increased with the increase of annealing temperature until 500 A degrees C, reaching the maximum value of 41.2 MPa, and then decreased as the annealing temperature continues to increase. All coatings presented a brittle fracture and the fracture occurred inside the ceramic coatings except for the coating annealed at 500 A degrees C, which had a brittle-ductile mixed fracture and the fracture occurred at the interface of bond coating and the substrate.

Our previous investigation indicated that blend samples with controlled component ratios and crystallization conditions exhibit good shape memory properties (J. Phys. Chem. B 2012, 116, 1256-1264). In this work, we systematically investigated the cold crystallization temperature effects on the crystal morphologies and the shape memory properties for the 50/50 blend. It was found that the quenched blend is an amorphous material with a low glass transition temperature. Annealing at temperatures above T-g of the blend induces crystallization of PVDF from the miscible amorphous PVDF/ACP phase, leading to an increased glass transition temperature of the blend. High annealing temperature results in large PVDF spherulites, while low annealing temperature produces tiny crystals in the blend. Furthermore, tiny crystals serve as the physical cross-link points and the amorphous regions among them act as the reversible phase for the blend materials during the mechanical deformations. Therefore, the PVDF/ACP blends with tiny crystals show not only high shape fixity but also excellent recovery ratios.

We mainly focus on how the inertia affects the cooperative behavior of the system. Interestingly, we find that the cooperation level has a nonmonotonic dependence on the inertia: with small inertia, cooperators will soon be invaded by defectors; with large inertia, players are unwilling to change their strategies and the cooperation level remains the same as the initial state; while a moderate inertia can induce the highest cooperation level. Moreover, effects of environmental noise and individual inertia are studied. Our work may be helpful in understanding the emergence and persistence of cooperation in nature and society.

Is the evolution of viviparity accompanied by a relative increase in maternal abdomen size, thus allowing viviparous females to increase the amount of space for eggs? To answer this question, we compared morphology and reproductive output between oviparous and viviparous species using three pairs of lizards, which included two Eremias, two Eutropis and two Phrynocephalus species with different reproductive modes. The two lizards in each pair differed morphologically, but were similar in the patterns of sexual dimorphism in abdomen and head sizes and the rates at which reproductive output increased with maternal body and abdomen sizes. Postpartum females were heavier in viviparous species, suggesting that the strategy adopted by females to allocate energy towards competing demands differs between oviparous and viviparous species. Reproductive output was increased in one viviparous species, but decreased in the other two, as compared with congeneric oviparous species. The space requirement for eggs did not differ between oviparous and viviparous females in one species pair, but was greater in viviparous females in the other two pairs greater in relative clutch mass and relative litter mass. In the two Phrynocephalus species, viviparous females produced heavier clutches than did oviparous females not by increasing the relative size of the abdomen, but by being more full of eggs. In none of the three species pairs was the maternal abdomen size greater in the viviparous species after accounting for body size. Our data show that the evolution of viviparity is not accompanied by a relative increase in maternal abdomen size in lizards. Future work could usefully investigate other lineages of lizards to determine whether our results are generalisable to all lizards.

This developmental switch depends on the differential expression of entire suites of the genes involved in the larval fate between the queens and workers. In this study, we compared the transcriptome differences between full-sister queen- (QL) and worker-destined larvae (WL) using high-throughput RNA-Seq. QL and WL at fourth (L4) and fifth instar (L5) were used to prepare four libraries and to generate 50,191,699 (QL4), 57,628,541 (WL4), 56,613,619 (QL5), and 58,626,829 (WL5) usable reads, which were assembled into groups of 7,952, 7,993, 7,971, and 8,023 genes, respectively. The transcriptome changes were investigated using the DEGs Package (DEGseq), which resulted in more than 4,500 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the castes. Eight of the DEGs were verified by quantitative real-time RTPCR (qRT-PCR), and the results supported our sequencing data. All of the DEGs were analysed using Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO) and then mapped using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. These results suggest that over 70% of the DEGs in each instar were more highly expressed in QL than in WL, possibly suggesting that the QL genes had higher transcriptional activity than the WL genes during differentiation. The same gene set is active (but differentially expressed) in both castes, which in turn result in dimorphic females. The L4 stage is a very active gene expression period for both QL and WL before their pupal stage. The activity of the mTOR (a target of rapamycin) encoding gene in the mTOR signalling pathway is higher in QL4 than in WL4, and this difference was no longer present by the L5 feeding stage. The genes down-stream of mTOR maintained this change at the L5 stage.

In this study, we investigated whether circulating miRNAs could be used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer (CaP) in a Chinese patient population. METHODS Illumina's Human v2 miRNA microarray was used to analyze miRNAs levels in a small set of patients [25 CaP, 17 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)] in an effort to identify CaP-specific miRNAs. The identified miRNAs were further examined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) in the same small set of patients. After the training phase of screening and selecting, the candidate miRNAs were validated in a larger independent cohort (80 CaP, 44 BPH, and 54 healthy controls) with qRT-PCR in the verification phase. RESULTS Five miRNAs were confirmed by qRT-PCR analysis in validation sets. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed all 5 miRNAs had diagnostic value. More importantly, further principal component analysis indicated component 1 extracted from expression data of the 5 miRNAs could differentiate CaP from BPH and healthy controls with high diagnosis performance, with an AUC of 0.924 and 0.860, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Our data suggested that circulating miRNAs could serve as biomarkers for CaP, and compared to single miRNA, the 5 miRNAs panel can accurately discriminate CaP from BPH and healthy controls with high sensitivity and specificity, and therefore, combined with routine PSA test, these 5 CaP-specific miRNAs may help improve CaP diagnosis in clinical application.

Thirty-four individuals were collected from two populations, eighteen from a mainland population in Xuwen, Guangdong, and the remaining 16 from an island population in Haikou, Hainan. These markers revealed a relatively high degree of genetic diversity (2-18 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (H (O) ranged from 0.000-0.938, and H (E) ranged from 0.160-0.954). Eight loci exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) after sequential Bonferroni correction due to heterozygote deficiencies, but only one locus (L311) with low heterozygosity in one population did significantly deviate from HWE in the other. Inbreeding may explain the deviations from HWE. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci in the samples. These microsatellite markers will be useful for future studies focusing on gene flow, population structure and evolutionary history of L. reevesii.

BesIII Collaboration	Study of J/psi -> p(p)over-bar and J/psi -> n(n)over-bar	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC FORM-FACTORS; NUCLEON; DECAYS; PHASE; QCD	The decays J/psi -> p (p) over bar and J/psi -> n (n) over bar have been investigated with a sample of 225.2 x 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII e(+)e(-) collider. The branching fractions are determined to be B(J/psi -> p (p) over bar) = (2.112 +/- 0.004 +/- 0.031 x 10(-3) and B(J/psi -> n (n) over bar) =(2.07 +/- 0.01 +/- 0.17) x 10(-3). Distributions of the angle theta between the proton or antineutron and the beam direction are well described by the form 1 + alpha cos(2)theta, and we find alpha = 0.595 +/- 0.012 +/- 0.015 for J/psi -> p (p) over bar and alpha = 0.50 +/- 0.04 +/- 0.21 for J/psi -> n (n) over bar. Our branching- fraction results suggest a large phase angle between the strong and electromagnetic amplitudes describing the J/psi -> N (N) over bar decay.	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; An, Z. H.; Bai, J.

The principle of the algorithm is based on the fact that the water-leaving radiance at ultraviolet wavelengths can be neglected as compared with that at the visible light wavelengths or even near-infrared wavelengths in most cases of highly turbid waters due to the strong absorption by detritus and colored dissolved organic matter. The UV-AC algorithm uses the ultraviolet band to estimate the aerosol scattering radiance empirically, and it does not need any assumption of the water's optical properties. Validations by both of the simulated data and in situ data show that the algorithm is appropriate for the retrieval of the water-leaving radiance in turbid waters. The UV-AC algorithm can be used for all the current satellite ocean color sensors, and it is especially useful for those ocean color sensors lacking the shortwave infrared bands. Moreover, the algorithm can be used for any turbid waters with negligible water-leaving radiance at ultraviolet wavelength. Based on our work, we recommend the future satellite ocean color remote sensors setting the ultraviolet band to perform the atmospheric correction in turbid waters.

Owing to cellular heterogeneity, traditional biochemical assays which analyze cells in bulk often overlook the rich information available when single cells are studied. Accurate and reliable determination of the chemical composition in individual cells would greatly improve the probability of discriminating infected cells from healthy ones and provide a solid foundation on study and development in various fields including biochemistry, medicine, and pathology clinic. Microfluidic chip system for single-cell analysis is now attracting broad interests. The ability of integrating the whole process on one microfluidic chip, including single cell injection, lysis, separation and detection of cellular constituents by chip-based CE, offers a new technical platform for single cell analysis. This article provides a review on recent advances in determining intracellular contents in individual cells using microfluidic devices. Focus areas include on-chip single cell manipulation by means of electroosmotic flow (EOF), pressure-driven flow combined with EOF and optical tweezer (OT) to perform sequentially single cell injection, lysis, separation and detection of cellular constituents by chip-based CE with highly sensitive detection. The approaches on on-chip derivatization are also addressed.

The deployment of a qutrit, instead of a qubit, as the coupler enables us to use resonant interactions exclusively for all qutrit-cavity and qutrit-pulse operations. This unique approach significantly shortens the time of operation, which is advantageous for reducing the adverse effects of qutrit decoherence and cavity decay on the fidelity of the protocol. Furthermore, the protocol involves no measurement on either the state of the qutrit or cavity photons. We also show that the protocol can be generalized to other systems by replacing the superconducting qutrit coupler with different types of physical qutrits, such as an atom in the case of cavity QED, to accomplish the same task.

Various studies on nitrile hydratase revealed its crystal structure and also proposed some hypothesis of its catalytic mechanism. Recent reports suggested the stereoselectivity of nitrile hydratase, which is regarded as a potential character to enrich its application. However, the isolated organisms are limited as only few genera identified contain this special stereoselective enzyme. This review described the corresponding strain for producing the enzyme, the structure and catalytic mechanism for stereoselectivity of the enzyme.

Current models of basal ganglia circuitry can only partially explain the cardinal symptoms in PD. We used functional MRI to investigate the causal connectivity of basal ganglia networks from the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) in PD in the movement and resting state. In controls, SNc activity predicted increased activity in the supplementary motor area, the default mode network, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but, in patients, activity predicted decreases in the same structures. The SNc had decreased connectivity with the striatum, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, thalamus, supplementary motor area, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, insula, default mode network, temporal lobe, cerebellum, and pons in patients compared to controls. Levodopa administration partially normalized the pattern of connectivity. Our findings show how the dopaminergic system exerts influences on widespread brain networks, including motor and cognitive networks. The pattern of basal ganglia network connectivity is abnormal in PD secondary to dopamine depletion, and is more deviant in more severe disease. Use of functional MRI with network analysis appears to be a useful method to demonstrate basal ganglia pathways in vivo in human subjects. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, CP; Su, QP; Liu, JM				Yang, Chui-Ping; Su, Qi-Ping; Liu, Jin-Ming			Proposal for realizing a multiqubit tunable phase gate of one qubit simultaneously controlling n target qubits using cavity QED	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article								We propose a way to realize a multiqubit tunable phase gate of one qubit simultaneously controlling n target qubits with atoms in cavity QED. In this proposal, classical pulses interact with atoms outside a cavity only, thus the experimental challenge of applying a pulse to an intracavity single atom without affecting other atoms in the same cavity is avoided. Because of employing a first-order large detuning, the gate can be performed fast when compared with the use of a second-order large detuning. Furthermore, the gate operation time is independent of the number of qubits. This proposal is quite general and can be applied to various superconducting qubits coupled to a resonator, nitrogen-vacancy centers coupled to a microsphere cavity, or quantum dots in cavity QED.

When the influent total nitrogen (TN) level was at 700 mg L-1, the nitrogen removal rate of R-2 (r = 0.5,4,5) was stable at approximately 3.5 kg m(-3) day(-1), which is higher than the value of 2.9 kg m(-3) day(-1) for R-1. This performance showed that the recirculation of effluent promoted the efficiency and stability of the Anammox process. The specific Anammox activity of the biomass in R-2 reached 13.3 mg-TN g(-1)-VSS h(-1), which is 34.3% higher than that in R-1. The dilution effect and the hydraulic shear force enhanced the performance of the Anammox reactor. However, effluent recirculation was prone to causing variation in the influent qualities. The variation in the substrate ratio did not significantly affect the stoichiometry of the Anammox reaction or the substrate removal capacity, but the high pH resulting from effluent recirculation, with the corresponding high free ammonia concentration, appeared to hinder the further improvement of Anammox performance.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETIC DECAYS; BARYONS	Using a sample of (225.2 +/- 2.8) x 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector, we present results of a study of J/psi -> gamma Lambda(Lambda) over bar and report the first observation of the isospin violating decay J/psi -> Lambda(Sigma) over bar (0) + c.c., in which (Sigma) over bar (0) decays to gamma (Lambda) over bar. The measured branching fractions are B(J/psi -> (Lambda) over bar Sigma(0)) = (1.46 +/- 0.11 +/- 0.12) x 10(-5) and B(J/psi -> Lambda(Sigma) over bar (0)) = (1.37 +/- 0.12 +/- 0.11) x 10(-5). We search for Lambda(1520) -> gamma Lambda decay, and find no evident signal, and an upper limit for the product branching fraction B(J/psi -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar (1520) + c.c) x B(Lambda(1520) -> gamma Lambda) < 4.1 x 10(-6) is set at the 90% confidence level. We also report the observation of eta(c) -> Lambda<(Lambda)over bar> in J/psi -> gamma eta(c), eta(c) -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar and measure the branching fraction B(eta(c) -> Lambda(Lambda) over bar) = (1.16 +/- 0.12(stat) +/- 0.19(syst) +/- 0.28(PDG)) x 10(-3).

Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) is a key mediator of many oxidative stress responses, involving GAPDH nuclear translocation and induction of cell death. We report here that GAPDH interacts with the telomerase RNA component (TERC), inhibits telomerase activity, and induces telomere shortening and breast cancer cell senescence. The Rossmann fold containing NAD(+) binding region on GAPDH is responsible for the interaction with TERC, whereas a lysine residue in the GAPDH catalytic domain is required for inhibiting telomerase activity and disrupting telomere maintenance. Furthermore, the GAPDH substrate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P) and the nitric oxide donor S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) both negatively regulate GAPDH inhibition of telomerase activity. Thus, we demonstrate that GAPDH is regulated to target the telomerase complex, resulting in an arrest of telomere maintenance and cancer cell proliferation.

In the astrocytic tumors cases, there were 4 cases of pure astrocytic tumors(WHO I and II), 2 cases of anaplastic astrocytic tumors(WHO III) and 4 cases of glioblastoma(WHO IV). The FTIR spectra obtained from the brain tumor tissues were analyzed and compared. Significant differences were found in the peak position, band shape and intensity of infrared absorption spectra between the different grades of astrocytic tumors. The intensity of the band at ca. 1400 cm(-1) band is increased with the malignancy grade of astrocytic tumors. In addition, some spectral differences between astrocytic tumors and oligoastrocytic tumors were observed. In the spectra of oligoastrocytic tumors, the peak position of 1240 and 1300 cm(-1) shifted to low wavenumbers. And the band at ca. 1270 cm(-1) appeared in the spectra of oligoastrocytic tumors which was not observed in the astrocytic tumors. These results demonstrate that FT-mid-IR spectroscopy exhibits prospect to develop a novel, non-invasive and rapid method for the detection of brain tumors.

J	Zeng, A; Lu, LY; Zhou, T				Zeng, An; Lu, Linyuan; Zhou, Tao			Manipulating directed networks for better synchronization	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							COMPLEX NETWORKS; WORLD; STABILITY; SYSTEMS; TIME	In this paper, we studied the strategies to enhance synchronization on directed networks by manipulating a fixed number of links. We proposed a centrality-based manipulating (CBM) method, where the node centrality is measured by the well-known PageRank algorithm. Extensive numerical simulation on many modeled networks demonstrated that the CBM method is more effective in facilitating synchronization than the degree-based manipulating method and the random manipulating method for adding or removing links. The reason is that the CBM method can effectively narrow the incoming degree distribution and reinforce the hierarchical structure of the network. Furthermore, we apply the CBM method to the links rewiring procedure where at each step one link is removed and one new link is added. The CBM method helps to decide which links should be removed or added. After several steps, the resulting networks are very close to the optimal structure from the theoretical analysis and the evolutionary optimization algorithm. The numerical simulations on the Kuramoto model further demonstrate that our method has an advantage in shortening the convergence time to synchronization on directed networks.

J	Yin, QP				Yin Qiping			The Canon Is "Ferry" : The Spiritual Sources of the Contemporary Western Poetry	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						ferry; canon; naming; bridging; Contemporary Western Poetry		"Ferrying" is a crucial element of the Western canon of poetry. To liken a poet to a ferryman is to shed light on the important message that contemporary Western poets are still holding fast to the poetic spirit which has lasted for thousands of years. The significance of a poetic canon lies in naming, namely the inaugural naming of and bringing into the open all that human beings experience, using a particular type of speech. Since the beginning of the contemporary world, ferrying/naming has become unprecedentedly difficult in terms of both its dimensions and the linguistic means, and the pleasure of naming has become mixed with hardships and even with pain. In addition to naming the existing reality and the living experience of it, the poet/ferryman has taken upon him/herself another mission, i. e. bridging the gaps between the past, the present and the future. Ferrying, which is characterized by time-space crossing, often gets intertwined with what Harold Bloom calls "strangeness" , thus constituting "a road to the canon".

The binding abilities of 1 towards different metal ions such as alkali and alkaline earth metal ions (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) and other metal ions ( Ba2+, Zn2+, Cd2+, Fe2+, Fe3+, Pb2+, Ni2+, Co2+, Hg2+, Ag+) have been examined by UV-vis and fluorescence spectroscopies. 1 displays high selectivity for Cu2+ among all test metal ions and a similar to 10-fold fluorescence enhancement in I582/I558 upon excitation at visible excitation wavelength. The binding mode of 1 and Cu2+ is a 1:1 stoichiometry determined via studies of Job plot, the nonlinear fitting of the fluorometric titration and ESI mass.

The R-I/S is defined as the mole ratio of the carboxyl units (interacting portion) to the glycerol units (stabilizing portion) in carboxyl-terminated hyperbranched polyglycerol (HPG-COOH) and can be changed systematically from 0.1 to 0.9. Especially, when it is above 0.5, highly monodisperse CaCO3 microspheres are first prepared by direct mixing of Ca2+ and CO32- in the presence of HPG-COOH. Our results demonstrate the topology effect of the hyperbranched polymers on the crystallization of CaCO3 and suggest that both the conformation of the stabilizing portion and the density and the distribution of the interacting portion determine the roles of HPG-COOH in CaCO3 crystallization, such as the calcium-binding ability, the face-selective interaction with crystals, and the inhibition of CaCO3 nucleation and growth.

The analytical expression for the Airy beam passing through the ABCD optical system of the EIT vapor is deduced and employed to analyze the propagation characteristics of the beam. It is shown that both the deflection position and the intensity of the Airy beam can be modulated by the Rabi frequency of the control light. Such a tunable optical behavior may have some potential applications in medicine science.

Losses of a substituted benzylideneacetone and a 4-hydroxycoumarin have been observed as a result of retro-Michael reaction. The added proton is initially localized between the two carbonyl oxygens through hydrogen bonding in the most thermodynamically favorable tautomer. Upon collisional activation, the added proton migrates to the C-3 of 4-hydroxycoumarin, which is called the dissociative protonation site, leading to the formation of the intermediate ion-neutral complex (INC). Within the INC, further proton transfer gives rise to a proton-bound complex. The cleavage of one hydrogen bond of the proton-bound complex produces the protonated 4-hydroxycoumarin, while the separation of the other hydrogen bond gives rise to the protonated benzylideneacetone. Theoretical calculations indicate that the 1, 5-proton transfer pathway is most thermodynamically favorable and support the existence of the INC. Both substituent effect and the kinetic method were utilized for explaining the relative abundances of protonated 4-hydroxycoumarin and protonated benzylideneacetone derivative. For monosubstituted warfarins, the electron-donating substituents favor the generation of protonated substituted benzylideneacetone, whereas the electron-withdrawing groups favor the formation of protonated 4-hydroxycoumarin.

We investigated the expression pattern of Plk genes and their potential role(s) in the rat ovary during the periovulatory period. Plk2 and Plk3 were highly induced both in intact ovaries and granulosa cells in vivo after treatment with the luteinizing hormone (LH) agonist, human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In vitro, hCG stimulated the expression of Plk2 in granulosa cells, but not Plk3. This induction of Plk2 expression was mimicked by both forskolin and phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA). Moreover, Plk2 expression was reduced by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis or the EGF pathway, but not by progesterone receptor antagonist (RU486) treatment. At the promoter level, mutation of the Sp1 binding sequence abolished the transcriptional activity of the Plk2 gene. ChIP assays also revealed the interaction of endogenous Sp1 protein in the Plk2 promoter region. Functionally, the over-expression of Plk2 and Plk3 arrested granulosa cells at the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. In contrast, the knockdown of Plk2 expression in granulosa cells decreased the number of cells in the G0/G1 stage of the cell cycle, but increased granulosa cell viability. In summary, hCG induced Plk2 and Plk3 expression in the rat ovary. Prostaglandins and the EGF signaling pathway are involved in regulating Plk2 expression. The transcription factor Sp1 is important for Plk2 transcriptional up-regulation. Our findings suggest that the increase in Plk2 and Plk3 expression contributes to the cell cycle arrest of granulosa cells which is important for the luteinization of granulosa cells during the periovulatory period.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) is a powerful technique for exploring this activity. With good spatial and temporal resolution, RS-fMRI is a promising approach for accurate localization of the focus of seizure activity. Although simultaneous electroencephalogram-fMRI has been performed with patients in the resting state, most studies focused on activation. This mini-review focuses on RS-fMRI alone, including its computational methods and its application to epilepsy.

Identification of a locus (DSP2) for disseminated superficial porokeratosis at chromosome 12q21.2-24.21	CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL DERMATOLOGY			English	Article							ACTINIC POROKERATOSIS; GENETIC-LOCUS; REGION; MAPS	Porokeratosis is a rare disorder of epidermal keratinization that is characterized by the presence of a border called the cornoid lamella. Disseminated superficial porokeratosis (DSP) is a subtype of porokeratosis, which is inherited as an autosomal trait. The first locus for DSP was localized to chromosome 18p11.3, but no causative gene has yet been identified. In this study, we recruited and analysed a large six-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant DSP. The genome-wide screening identified a maximum two-point LOD score of 3.06 at ? = 0.00 with the microsatellite marker D12S78. Fine mapping and haplotype analysis defined a critical region of 38 Mb between D12S326 and D12S79 on chromosome 12q21.224.21, which is a probable second locus identified for DSP (DSP2). We sequenced 50 candidate genes in this region, but no causative mutation was found. This study provides a map location for isolation of a gene causing DSP.	[Wang, Z.

Defects in the DNA damage response lead to genomic instability and ultimately predispose organs to cancer. Nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (Nampt), which is involved in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide metabolism, is overexpressed in a variety of tumors. In this report, we found that Nampt physically associated with CtIP and DNA-PKcs/Ku80, which are key factors in HR and NHEJ, respectively. Depletion of Nampt by small interfering RNA (siRNA) led to defective NHEJ-mediated DSB repair and enhanced HR-mediated repair. Furthermore, the inhibition of Nampt expression promoted proliferation of cancer cells and normal human fibroblasts and decreased p-galactosidase staining, indicating a delay in the onset of cellular senescence in normal human fibroblasts. Taken together, our results suggest that Nampt is a suppressor of HR-mediated DSB repair and an enhancer of NHEJ-mediated DSB repair, contributing to the acceleration of cellular senescence.

Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) has long been recognized as an important enzyme for energy metabolism and the production of ATP and pyruvate through anaerobic glycolysis in the cytoplasm. 2. Recent studies have shown that GAPDH has multiple functions independent of its role in energy metabolism. Although increased GAPDH gene expression and enzymatic function is associated with cell proliferation and tumourigenesis, conditions such as oxidative stress impair GAPDH catalytic activity and lead to cellular aging and apoptosis. 3. The mechanism(s) underlying the effects of GAPDH on cellular proliferation remains unclear, yet much evidence has been accrued that demonstrates a variety of interacting partners for GAPDH, including proteins, various RNA species and telomeric DNA. 4. The present mini review summarizes recent findings relating to the extraglycolytic functions of GAPDH and highlights the significant role this enzyme plays in regulating both cell survival and apoptotic death.

Previous work has highlighted the importance of social comparison in reward processing. However, the time-course of the social comparison effect in outcome evaluation remains largely unknown. The purpose of this study was to explore to what extent brain activity is modulated by social comparison between an individual and their anonymous partner. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were measured while the participants viewed their own and their partner's gain and loss outcomes based on their performance in a dot estimation task. Analysis of ERPs revealed that the feedback-related negativity (FRN) amplitude differences between gains and losses were not modulated by social comparison. In contrast, the P300 was larger for gains and showed an effect of social comparison independent of feedback valence. A late component, the late positive potential (LPP), was also modulated by social comparison, but it was insensitive to feedback valence. The data suggest that social comparison modulates outcome evaluation at several points in the information processing stream. Social comparison has no effect on the early coarse evaluation stage, but modulates the late cognitive/affective appraisal and re-appraisal processes. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence for the importance of social comparisons in outcome evaluations by the human brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Conventional task designs for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies are not appropriate for frequency analysis. The present study aimed to propose a new paradigm, real-time finger force feedback (RT-FFF), to study the brain mechanisms of sustained attention and neurofeedback. We compared the low-frequency fluctuations in both behavioral and fMRI data from 38 healthy adults (19 males; mean age, 22.3 years). Two fMRI sessions, in RT-FFF and sham finger force feedback (S-FFF) states, were acquired (TR 2 s, Siemens Trio 3-Tesla scanner, 8 min each, counter-balanced). Behavioral data of finger force were obtained simultaneously at a sampling rate of 250 Hz. Frequency analysis of the behavioral data showed lower amplitude in the lowfrequency band (0.004-0.104 Hz) but higher amplitude in the high-frequency band (27.02-125 Hz) in the RT-FFF than the S-FFF states. The mean finger force was not significantly different between the two states. fMRI data analysis showed higher fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) in the S-FFF than in the RT-FFF state in the visual cortex, but higher fALFF in RT-FFF than S-FFF in the middle frontal gyrus, the superior frontal gyrus, and the default mode network. The behavioral results suggest that the proposed paradigm may provide a new approach to studies of sustained attention. The fMRI results suggest that a distributed network including visual, motor, attentional, and default mode networks may be involved in sustained attention and/or real-time feedback. This paradigm may be helpful for future studies on deficits of attention, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury.

HCV antibody test has a longer window period and is not applicable in the immunosuppressed population. Although HCV RNA test reduces the window period, it is still not widely recommended because of its high cost and requirement of specific equipment. HCV core antigen is another direct virological marker which has been investigated in recent years. HCV core antigen assay is as simple as the HCV antibodies assay and can detect HCV infection only 1 day delay compared to the HCV RNA assay. In order to evaluate the application of HCV core antigen test in HCV diagnosis and management, we performed this meta-analysis. Twenty five articles were finally included in meta-analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with MetaDisc 1.4 and Stata 11.0. The pooled sensitivity of HCV core antigen assay was 0.84 (95 % CI, 0.83-0.85), and the pooled specificity was 0.98 (95 % CI, 0.97-0.98). HCV core antigen assays may not displace HCV RNA assays to be a definitive diagnosis of HCV infection until now. Considering the higher sensitivity (0.926) and specificity (0.991) of subgroup, HCV-cAg detection is a promising method as a confirmatory test for HCV antibody positive, therapy-naive individuals. Explored by meta-regression and subgroup analysis, possible sources of heterogeneity of specificity was found, while the heterogeneity of sensitivity was still significant.

J	Ling, AF; Xu, CX				Ling, Ai-fan; Xu, Cheng-xian			Robust portfolio selection involving options under a "marginal plus joint" ellipsoidal uncertainty set	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL AND APPLIED MATHEMATICS			English	Article						Robust optimization; Robust portfolio; Probability constraint; Linear matrix inequality	OPTIMIZATION	In typical robust portfolio selection problems, one mainly finds portfolios with the worst-case return under a given uncertainty set, in which asset returns can be realized. A too large uncertainty set will lead to a too conservative robust portfolio. However, if the given uncertainty set is not large enough, the realized returns of resulting portfolios will be outside of the uncertainty set when an extreme event such as market crash or a large shock of asset returns occurs. The goal of this paper is to propose robust portfolio selection models under so-called "marginal + joint" ellipsoidal uncertainty set and to test the performance of the proposed models. A robust portfolio selection model under a "marginal + joint" ellipsoidal uncertainty set is proposed at first. The model has the advantages of models under the separable uncertainty set and the joint ellipsoidal uncertainty set, and relaxes the requirements on the uncertainty set. Then, one more robust portfolio selection model with option protection is presented by combining options into the proposed robust portfolio selection model. Convex programming approximations with second-order cone and linear matrix inequalities constraints to both models are derived. The proposed robust portfolio selection model with options can hedge risks and generates robust portfolios with well wealth growth rate when an extreme event occurs. Tests on real data of the Chinese stock market and simulated options confirm the property of both the models. Test results show that (1) under the "marginal + joint" uncertainty set, the wealth growth rate and diversification of robust portfolios generated from the first proposed robust portfolio model (without options) are better and greater than those generated from Goldfarb and Iyengar's model, and (2) the robust portfolio selection model with options outperforms the robust portfolio selection model without options when some extreme event occurs.

Bulk data dissemination is a basic building block for sensor network applications. The problem of designing efficient bulk data dissemination protocols has been addressed in a number of recent studies. The problem of accurately analyzing the performance of these protocols, however, has not been addressed sufficiently in the literature. In this work, we show a way of accurately analyzing the performance of bulk data dissemination protocols in WSNs. Our model can be applied to practical network topologies by use of the shortest propagation path. Our model is accurate by considering topological information, impact of contention, and impact of pipelining. We validate the analytical results through testbeds and detailed simulations. Results show that the analytical results fit well with the testbed results and simulation results.

This suggests the possibility that reward from smoking is substitutable by self-expansion (through competition with the same neural system), potentially aiding cessation efforts. Using a model of self-expansion in the context of romantic love, the present fMRI experiment examined whether, among nicotine-deprived smokers, relationship self-expansion is associated with deactivation of cigarette cue-reactivity regions. Results indicated that among participants who were experiencing moderate levels of craving, cigarette cue-reactivity regions (e.g., cuneus and posterior cingulate cortex) showed significantly less activation during self-expansion conditions compared with control conditions. These results provide evidence that rewards from one domain (self-expansion) can act as a substitute for reward from another domain (nicotine) to attenuate cigarette cue reactivity.

BESIII Collaboration	First Observation of the M1 Transition psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							DECAY	Using a sample of 106 x 10(6) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring, we have made the first measurement of the M1 transition between the radially excited charmonium S-wave spin-triplet and the radially excited S-wave spin-singlet states: psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S). Analyses of the processes psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S) with eta(c)(2S) -> (KSK+/-)-K-0 pi(-/+) and K+K- pi(0) give an eta(c)(2S) signal with a statistical significance of greater than 10 standard deviations under a wide range of assumptions about the signal and background properties. The data are used to obtain measurements of the eta(c)(2S) mass (M(eta(c)(2S)) = 3637.6 +/- 2.9(stat) +/- 1.6(syst) MeV/c(2)), width (Gamma(eta(c)(2S)) = 16.9 +/- 6.4(stat) +/- 4.8(syst) MeV), and the product branching-fraction (B(psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S)) x B(eta(c)(2S) -> K (K) over bar pi) = (1.30 +/- 0.20(stat) +/- 0.30(syst)) x 10(-5)). Combining our result with a BABAR measurement of B(eta(c)(2S) -> K (K) over bar pi), we find the branching fraction of the M1 transition to be (B psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c)(2S)) = (6.8 +/- 1.1(stat) +/- 4.5(syst)) x 10(-4).

PM2.5) air pollution to increased morbidity and mortality of cardiovascular diseases in the general population, but the biologic mechanisms of these associations are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between daily variations in exposure to PM2.5 and inflammatory responses in mice during and for 2 months after the Beijing Olympic Games. Male C57BL/6 mice were exposed to Beijing PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) in 2008 during the 2 months of Beijing Olympic and Paralympic Games, and for 2 months after the end of the Games. During the Games, circulating monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 and interleukin 6 were increased significantly in the PM2.5 exposure group, when compared with the FA control group, although there were no significant inter-group differences in tumor necrosis factor-alpha or interferon-gamma, or in macrophages, neutrophils or lymphocytes in the spleen or thymus between these 2 groups. However, macrophages were significantly increased in the lung and visceral fat with increasing PM2.5. After the Olympic Games, there were no significant PM2.5-associated differences for macrophages, neutrophils or lymphocytes in the thymus, but macrophages were significantly elevated in the lung, spleen, subcutaneous and visceral fat with increasing PM2.5, and the numbers of macrophages were even higher after than those during the Games. Moreover, the number of neutrophils was markedly higher in the spleen for the PPM2.5-exposed- than the FA-group. These data suggest that short-term increases in exposure to ambient PM2.5 leads to increased systemic inflammatory responses, primarily macrophages and neutrophils in'the lung, spleen, and visceral adipose tissue. Short-term air quality improvements were significantly associated with reduced overall inflammatory responses. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Pristine MWCNTs accelerate crystallization of PVDF as an efficient nucleation agent, while the formed crystals are mainly nonpolar alpha crystal form with few polar beta crystals. Incorporation of only ionic liquid results in depression of the PVDF melt crystallization rate due to the miscibility of IL with PVDF but leads to a higher content of polar crystals (beta and gamma forms) than MWCNTs. The ionic liquid and MWCNTs show significant synergetic effects on both the nucleation and the formation of polar crystals for PVDF by melt crystallization. Addition of IL-MWCNTs not only improves the MWCNTs dispersion in PVDF matrix but also increases the overall crystallization rate of PVDF drastically. More important, the melt-crystallized PVDF nanocomposites with IL-MWCNTs show 100% polar polymorphs but no a crystal forms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the achievements of full polar crystal form in the melt-crystallized PVDF without mechanical deformation or electric field. The IL to MWCNTs ratio and the IL-MWCNTs loading content effects on the crystallization behavior of PVDF in the nanocomposites were also studied. It is considered that the specific interactions between >CF2 with the planar cationic imidazolium ring wrapped on the MWCNTs surface lead to the full zigzag conformations of PVDF; thus, nucleation in polar crystals (beta and gamma forms) lattice is achieved and full polar crystals are obtained by subsequent crystal growth from the nuclei.

We use quantum Fisher information to distinguish and characterize behaviors of the evolved state for Bose-Einstein condensates in a symmetric double well, which display a classical bifurcation and a transition from Josephson oscillation to self-trapping. We find that the precision of the parameter estimation on the evolved state in the unstable regime is much higher than that in the stable regime, which lies at the shot-noise level. We also show that the parameter sensitivity of the evolved state approaches the Heisenberg limit in the Josephson oscillation regime, while it is just scaled as the shot-noise limit in the self-trapping regime. Finally, we discuss the relation between the parameter sensitivity of the evolved state and the entanglement entropy.

The initial state of the photon field is assumed to be a superposition of coherent states, leading to a more intricate LZ transition. Applying the rotating-wave approximation (RWA), analytical results are obtained revealing the enhancement of the LZ probability by increasing the average photon number. We also consider the creation of entanglement and the change of photon statistics during the LZ process. Without the RWA, we find some qualitative differences of the LZ dynamics from the RWA results; e. g., the average photon number no longer monotonically enhances the LZ probability. The ramifications and implications of these results are explored.

In the silicon-nitrogen binary cluster system, their structures transfer gradually from the three-dimensional structures of Si-rich clusters into the like-planar or like-linear structures of N-rich clusters. Near m = n stoichiometry, the lowest energy structures have higher stability. They usually feature a strong alternation of Si and N atoms. In addition, some N dimers and one small isomer can be observed in N-rich clusters. The binding energy between the N dimers and the small isomer is less than 0.02 eV. The most stable structures for pure N-n clusters with odd atom number also contain one N trimer besides some N dimers.

However, the Anammox process is inhibited by many factors, which prevent improvements on the process as well as the application of the Anammox process. A variety of inhibitory substances, such as substrates (ammonia and nitrite), organic matter (nontoxic organic matter and toxic organic matter), salts, heavy metals, phosphate and sulfide, are commonly present in the practical applications. We conducted a detailed review of previous researches on the inhibition of Anammox processes. As a result of differences in operating conditions, experimental methods, physical structures of sludge (flocculent sludge, biofilm or granular sludge) and microbial populations involved, the effect of inhibitors varies widely. Temperature and pH adjustments, dissolved oxygen and oxidation-reduction potential controls, substrate concentration and load controls, sludge acclimatization and addition of auxiliary agents can significantly improve the performance of Anammox process under inhibitory conditions.

This study aimed to demonstrate the alterations in morphometry and functional connectivity in the thalamic nuclei in IGE. Methods: Fifty-two patients with IGE characterized by generalized tonic-clonic seizures and 67 healthy controls were involved in the study. The three-dimensional high-resolution T1-weighted MRI data were acquired for voxel-based morphometry (VBM) analysis, and resting-state blood-oxygenation level functional MRI data were acquired for functional connectivity analysis. The thalamic nuclei of bilateral medial dorsal nucleus (MDN) and pulvinar, as detected with decreased gray matter volumes in patients with IGE through VBM analysis, were selected as seed regions for functional connectivity analysis. Results: Different alteration patterns were found in functional connectivity of the thalamic nuclei with decreased gray matter volumes in IGE. Seeding at the MDN, decreased connectivity in the bilateral orbital frontal cortex, caudate nucleus, putamen and amygdala were found in the patients (P<0.05 with correction). However, seeding at the pulvinar, no significant alteration of functional connectivity was found in the patients (P<0.05 with correction). Conclusions: Some specific impairment of thalamic nuclei in IGE was identified using morphological and functional connectivity MRI approaches. These findings may strongly support the different involvement of the thalamocortical networks in IGE.

To further shed light on the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by cisplatin, we examined the nuclear proteome profiles of HeLa cells treated with 5 mu M cisplatin for different times (2, 12, and 24 h). Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) identified 98 differentially expressed proteins in cisplatin-treated cells as compared to control cells. Among them, 54 spots (55%) were down-regulated and 44 spots (45%) were up-regulated. 51 spots were subjected to Matrix-assisted-laser-desorption-ionization Time-of-flight/time-of-flight Mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/TOF MS) identification, and 40 spots were identified. Among these, 22 proteins were located in nucleus. These proteins were involved in stress response, cell cycle and division, apoptosis, mRNA processing, transport, splicing and microRNA (miRNA) maturation. The changed expression of Annexin A1 and Lamin B1 were confirmed by Western blot. The role of Annexin A1 in the response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage was further analyzed, and it was shown that after Annexin A1 knockdown, cisplatin-induced DNA damage was significantly increased. In addition, the changed expression of several miRNAs was also observed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Taken together, these data indicate that cisplatin-induced DDR is a complex process, and that those proteins identified by proteomics can lead to new directions for a better understanding of this process.

In this work, embryogenic cell cultures derived from Gossypium hirsutum L. cv Coker 312 hypocotyl callus were transformed via Agrobacterium tumefaciens with the rice cytochrome P450 gene, CYP81A6 (bel). In rice, bel has been shown to confer resistance to both bentazon and sulfanylurea herbicides. Transformed cells were selected on a liquid medium supplemented alternately or simultaneously with kanamycin (50mg/L) and bentazon (4.2 mu mol). A total of 17 transgenic cotton lines were recovered, based on the initial resistance to bentazon and on PCR detection of the bel transgene. Bel integration into the cotton genome was confirmed by Southern blot and expression of the transgene was verified by RT-PCR. In greenhouse and experimental plot trials, herbicide (bentazon) tolerance of up to 1250mg/L was demonstrated in the transgenic plants. Transgenic lines with a single copy of the bel gene showed normal Mendelian inheritance of the characteristic. Importantly, resistance to bentazon was shown to be stably incorporated in the T1, T2 and T3 generations of self-fertilised descendents and in plants outcrossed to another upland cotton cultivar. Engineering resistance to bentazon in cotton through the heterologous expression of bel opens the possibility of incorporating this trait into elite cultivars, a strategy that would give growers a more flexible alternative to weed management in cotton crops.

We find that the asymmetric hydrogen-terminations can break the magnetic degeneracy and favor ferromagnetic state in the ZSiCNRs. The nanoribbons are transformed to half-metals by the bare Si edge, while the saturated Si/C edge brings quasi-half-metallic behaviors, for which two spin-polarized bands intersect at the Fermi level with tiny band gaps. The opening of such tiny gaps depends on the molecular origins of bands, as well as ribbon widths. For wide nanoribbons, all the ZSiCNRs with asymmetric hydrogen-terminations are converted to half-metals. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

It consisted of a microfluidic chip integrating variable-volume sampling channels (0.1-0.8 mu L), an eight-way multi-functional valve used in flow injection analysis (FIA), a syringe pump and a peristaltic pump of the Ar ICP-MS instrument. Three solutions, Le., 15, 40 and 100 g L-1 glucose in 20% ethanol were used to simulate Chinese rice wine of the dry type, the semidry type and the semisweet type, each. The effects of their volume introduced into ICP-MS on the plasma stability and ICP-MS intensities were studied. The experimental results showed that neither alteration of plasma stability nor carbon deposition was observed when the sampling volume of 20% ethanol containing 100 g L-1 glucose was downscaled to 0.8 mu L. Further reducing the sampling volume to 0.4 mu L, no significant difference between the intensities of multi-element standard prepared in three simulated Chinese rice wine matrices and those in aqueous solution was observed. It indicated no negative effect of Chinese rice wine matrix on the ICP-MS intensities. A sampling volume of 0.4 mu L was considered to be a good compromise between sensitivity and matrix effect. The flow rate of the carrier was chosen as 20 mu L min(-1) for obtaining peaks with the highest peak height within the shortest time. Based on these observations, a microflow injection (mu FI) method for the direct determination of cadmium and lead in Chinese rice wine by ICP-MS using an external aqueous calibration was developed. The sample throughput was 45 h(-1) with the detection limit of 19.8 and 10.4 ng L-1 for Cd and Pb, respectively. The contents of Cd and Pb in 10 Chinese rice wine samples were measured. The results agreed well with those determined by ICP-MS with the conventional sampling system after microwave assisted digestion. The recoveries of three Chinese rice wine samples ranged between 95.5 and 102.8%. Furthermore, the determined contents of Cd and Pb in a certified reference material of red wine (GBW 10031) and a quality control test material of wine (PAPAS T07163QC) by the proposed method were in fairly good accordance with the certified/assigned values. All results verified the accuracy of our method. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Assessment of Grain Security in China by Using the AHP and DST Methods	JOURNAL OF AGRICULTURAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Analytic hierarchy process; China; Dempster-Shafer theory; Grain security; Risk assessment	ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; FOOD SECURITY; CHALLENGES	China is one of the largest grain producing and consuming nations in the world and the importance of grain security to the Chinese can never be overemphasized. In this paper, we present a comprehensive early-warning model for evaluating the status of grain security in China. The model is based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and the Dempster-Shafer theory (DST). We divided the risk assessment into four stages. First, we seek risk sources and identify the indices to be used in the model. Then, we preprocess the index data to obtain the index directions and risk bounds. After that, we assign index weights via AHP method. Finally, we evaluate risk of grain security via DST method and determine the overall risk degree. An empirical analysis is conducted to demonstrate the use of the model for evaluating the status of grain security in China. The result shows that the model which conforms to the reality of China is effective and can be used as a grain security pre-warning monitoring tool.

This dehydrogenase was expressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity for biochemical and enzymatic analysis. The effect of pH and temperature assay showed that the optimal pH and temperature of BcGDH are 9.0 and 37 degrees C, respectively. Thermal stability assay showed that the stability of BcGDH is solvent dependent. At the presence of 2 M NaCl, BcGDH maintains its maximum activity even incubated at 65 degrees C for 1 h. pH stability assay showed that BcGDH is stable at a wide range of pH (4.4 to 8.5) indicates that BcGDH is an acid-resistant dehydrogenase. Substrate specificity results indicate that BcGDH has a highly substrate specificity toward D-glucose. Finally, the potential contribution of surface electrostatic effect and hydrophobic effect to the acid-resistant property of BcGDH was discussed.

In this paper, the poly(lactic acid) (PLLA)/ethylene-co-acrylic ester-co-glycidyl methacrylate (E-AE-GMA) rubber (80/20) nanoalloys and microalloys were fabricated by melt blending and the structure property relationships of the prepared alloys were investigated. In the nanoalloys, the rubber domains are homogeneously dispersed in the PLLA matrix with the overall domain size of <100 nm. Such nanoalloys exhibit not only high transparency in the visible region, but also significantly improved ductility, and impact strength, compared with neat PLLA. Moreover, the nanodomains in the PLLA matrix enhance the crystallization rate of PLLA drastically. The overall crystallization rate of the PLLA nanoalloy is even higher than that of the PLLA nucleated by talc. In contrast, the PLLA microalloy has a phase structure with the size of the rubber domains being in the micrometer to submicrOmeter scale. The microalloy is opaque and displays almost the same tensile strength and modulus as the nanoalloy, but much higher impact strength than the nanoalloy.

However, many properties of directed networks have still not been understood clearly. In this paper we explore the dynamics and pattern formation of strongly connected complex directed Boolean map (BM) networks with excitatory interactions by using synchronous updating policy. Several theorems on the oscillatory dynamics are proposed and rigorously proven by logical analysis. Based on these theorems, we can successfully predict the global asymptotic behaviors of networks from local initial conditions of few nodes in a single loop, and effectively control and modulate the oscillations of networks by modifying few links.

To investigate the nature and function of elongation factor 1 beta' from Spodoptera exigua (SeEF-1 beta'), its cDNA was cloned. This contained an open reading frame of 672 nucleotides encoding a protein of 223 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 24.04 kDa and pI of 4.53. Northern blotting revealed that SeEF-1 beta' mRNA is expressed in brain, epidermis, fat body, midgut, Malpighian tubules, ovary and tracheae. RT-PCR revealed that SeEF-1 beta' mRNA is expressed at different levels in fat body and whole body during different developmental stages. In RNAi experiments, the survival rate of insects injected with SeEF-1 beta' dsRNA was 58.7% at 36 h after injection, which was significantly lower than three control groups. Other elongation factors and transcription factors were also influenced when EF-1 beta' was suppressed. The results demonstrate that SeEF-1 beta' is a key gene in transcription in S. exigua.

SP.; LAGENOPHRYS CILIOPHORA; PHYLOGENETIC-RELATIONSHIPS; TAXONOMIC CHARACTERIZATION; GENE SEQUENCE; NORTH CHINA	The stomatogenesis of peritrich ciliates is an important developmental process but has been studied relatively little for such a large, diverse taxon. Complex oral structures and an inability of staining techniques to reveal them clearly have been the major factors hindering investigation of this process. In the present study, an improved method of staining with protargol was used to investigate the entire process of stomatogenesis in a large, colonial species of peritrich, Pseudepistylis songi, and to compare it to descriptions of stomatogenesis in several other species. We found that P. songi and other peritrichs have the same general type of ophryobuccokinetal stomatogenesis, with the parental oral complex being inherited by one daughter and the new oral complex by the other daughter; however, some differences between individual taxa appear to have arisen in the course of evolution. Reorganization of the entire germinal kinety (Gk) to form the germinal anlage may be plesiomorphic, with restriction of reorganization to its abstomal part being apomorphic. Development of the entire new haplokinety of one daughter cell (2Hk) from the germinal band or its homologue also appears to be plesiomorphic, with development of peristomial and infundibular parts of 2Hk from separate rudiments being apomorphic. Furthermore, development of the new Gk of the parental oral complex (1Gk) from the entire infundibular part of the parental haplokinety (1Hk) may be plesiomorphic, and development from just the abstomal part may be apomorphic. Finally, development of the Gk of the new oral complex (2Gk) from residual kinetosomes of the germinal band appears to be plesiomorphic.

The protein was amenable to overexpression in Escherichia coli under control of the T7 promoter, resulting in expression of the active, soluble protein that constituted 30% of the total cell protein content. This enzyme showed optimal activity at 40 degrees C and retained about 50% maximal activity at 5-10 degrees C. EstC23 showed remarkable stability in up to 50% (v/v) benzene and alkanes (high log P solvents). When incubated for 7 days in the presence of 50% benzene or alkanes, the enzyme maintained its 2-3 fold elevated activity. The purified enzyme also cleaved sterically hindered esters of tertiary alcohols. These results indicate that EstC23 has potential for use in industrial processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Recombinant 55.5 kDa RvTDC converted tryptophan into tryptamine. The K (m) of RvTDC for tryptophan was 2.89 mM, higher than those reported in other TIAs-producing plants. It demonstrated that RvTDC had lower affinity to tryptophan than other plant TDCs. The K (m) of RvTDC was also much higher than that of strictosidine synthase and strictosidine glucosidase in Rauvolfia. This suggested that TDC might be the committed-step enzyme involved in ajmalicine biosynthesis in R. verticillata. The expression of RvTDC was slightly upregulated by MeJA; the five MEP pathway genes and SGD showed no positive response to MeJA; and STR was sharply downregulated by MeJA. MeJA-treated hairy roots produced higher level of ajmalicine (0.270 mg g(-1) DW) than the EtOH control (0.183 mg g(-1) DW). Highest RvTDC expression level was detected in hairy root, about respectively 11, 19, 65, and 109-fold higher than in bark, young leaf, old leaf, and root. Highest ajmalicine content was also found in hairy root (0.249 mg g(-1) DW) followed by in bark (0.161 mg g(-1) DW) and young leaf (0.130 mg g(-1) DW), and least in root (0.014 mg g(-1) DW). Generally, the expression level of RvTDC was positively consistent with the accumulation of ajmalicine. Therefore, it could be deduced that TDC might be the key enzyme involved in ajmalicine biosynthesis in Rauvolfia.

When the concentration of sodium chloride was 3 M and microwave power was 40W, 93.2% of the enzyme was coupled to the support by 3 min, and the maximum specific activity of the immobilized enzyme was 17,925.1 U mg(-1). This was a 4.5-fold increase in activity versus enzyme immobilized using conventional techniques, and a 1.6-fold increase versus free enzyme. Additionally, the thermal stability of the immobilized thermolysin was significantly improved. When incubated at 70 degrees C, there was no reduction in activity by 3.5 h, whereas free thermolysin lost most of its activity by 3 h. Immobilization also protected the thermolysin against organic solvent denaturation. The microwave-assisted immobilization technique, combined with sodium chloride salting-in, could be applied to other sparsely soluble enzymes immobilization because of its simplicity and high efficiency.

J	Zhou, Y; Qian, HF				Zhou, Yuan; Qian, Haifeng			Practical round-optimal blind signatures without random oracles or non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						optimal round; concurrent security; bilinear pairings; blind signature; non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs	SECURITY; ENCRYPTION; SCHEME	Blind signatures are generated by means of a protocol between the signer and a user such that the signer can neither see the message being signed and nor learn any information on the signature being produced. Time/space complexity and security model (random oracle model versus standard model; sequential, parallel, or concurrent security) are commonly used to evaluate blind signature schemes. The paper presents the first round-optimal blind signatures without random oracles or non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs. The proposed blind signature scheme achieves concurrent security and perfect blindness while preserving the efficiency of computation and communication. A novel class of computational problems, called one-more-output (OMO) problems, is introduced to prove the unforgeability of the scheme. The paper states the corresponding lower bound of the OMO problem in the generic group model. Such a computational problem might be of independent interests in designing other cryptographic protocol and primitives. Copyright (C) 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

DNA damage induces down-regulation of UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase, increases ceramide levels and triggers apoptosis in p53-deficient cancer cells	BIOCHIMICA ET BIOPHYSICA ACTA-MOLECULAR AND CELL BIOLOGY OF LIPIDS			English	Article						Ceramide; Apoptosis; Ceramide glucosyltransferase; p53; HPV16 E6	DAUNORUBICIN-INDUCED APOPTOSIS; NOVO SPHINGOLIPID BIOSYNTHESIS; HEREDITARY SENSORY NEUROPATHY; TANDEM MASS-SPECTROMETRY; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE; N-TERMINAL KINASE; GLUCOSYLCERAMIDE SYNTHASE; SERINE PALMITOYLTRANSFERASE; GLYCOSPHINGOLIPID SYNTHESIS; BREAST-CANCER	DNA damaging agents typically induce an apoptotic cascade in which p53 plays a central role. However, absence of a p53-mediated response does not necessarily abrogate programmed cell death, due to the existence of p53-independent apoptotic pathways, such as those mediated by the pro-apoptotic molecule ceramide. We compared ceramide levels before and after DNA damage in human osteosarcoma (U2OS) and colon cancer (HCT116) cells that mere either expressing or deficient in p53. When treated with mitomycin C. p53-deficient cells, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a marked increase in ceramide levels. Microarray analysis of genes involved in ceramide metabolism identified acid ceramidase (ASAH1, up-regulated), ceramide glucosyltransferase (UGCG, down-regulated), and galactosylceramidase (GALC, up-regulated) as the three genes most affected. Experiments employing pharmacological and siRNA agents revealed that inhibition of UGCG is sufficient to increase ceramide levels and induce cell death. When inhibition of UGCG and treatment with mitomycin C were combined, p53-deficient, but not p53-expressing cells, showed a significant increase in cell death, suggesting that the regulation of sphingolipid metabolism could be used to sensitize cells to chemotherapeutic drugs.

High molecular weight hyaluronan decreases oxidative DNA damage induced by EDTA in human corneal epithelial cells	EYE			English	Article						hyaluronan; EDTA; DNA damage; ROS; corneal epithelial cell	HISTONE H2AX PHOSPHORYLATION; DOUBLE-STRAND BREAKS; DRUG PENETRATION; IONIZING-RADIATION; GAMMA-H2AX FOCI; COMET ASSAY; RABBIT; CYTOTOXICITY; MECHANISMS; ENHANCERS	Purpose To investigate the toxic effects of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA), a corneal penetration enhancer in topical ophthalmic formulations, on DNA in human corneal epithelial cells (HCEs), and to investigate whether the effect induced by EDTA can be inhibited by high molecular weight hyaluronan (HA). Methods Cells were exposed to EDTA in concentrations ranging from 0.00001 to 0.01% for 60min, or 30min high molecular weight HA pretreatment followed by EDTA treatment. The cell viability was measured by the MTT test. Cell apoptosis was determined with annexin V staining by flow cytometry. The DNA single-and double-strand breaks of HCEs were examined by alkaline comet assay and by immunofluorescence microscope detection of the phosphorylated form of histone variant H2AX (gamma H2AX) foci, respectively. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production was assessed by the fluorescent probe, 2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate. Results EDTA exhibited no adverse effect on cell viability and did not induce cell apoptosis in human corneal epithelial cells at concentrations lower than 0.01%. However, a significant increase of DNA single-and double-strand breaks was observed in a dose-dependent manner with all the concentrations of EDTA tested in HCEs. In addition, EDTA treatment led to elevated ROS generation. Moreover, 30 min preincubation with high molecular weight HA significantly decreased EDTA-induced ROS generation and DNA damage. Conclusions EDTA could induce DNA damage in HCEs, probably through oxidative stress. Furthermore, high molecular weight HA was an effective protective agent that had antioxidant properties and decreased DNA damage induced by EDTA.

In particular, the sequential chemotherapy of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI has become the preferred post-operational treatment approach for gastrointestinal cancer and an important palliative care program for advanced cancer. However, the sequential chemotherapy of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI showed severe side effects due to the fact that the toxicity of the drugs can be enhanced by each other. Here, we report the dynamic changes in the activities of serum ACTH, cortisol, renin, angiotensin, and aldosterone in patients following multiple cycles of FOLFOX/FOLFIRI sequential chemotherapy. We found that the sequential chemotherapy might cause damage to the activities of the endocrine cells and/or the sympathetic nerve, and alter endocrine function, specifically the ACTH-cortisol and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axes.

The investigation showed that the binding affinity with G4-DNA was significantly increased when 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was modified with arylsulfonyl groups. The presence of strong electron-withdrawing groups on benzene sulfonyl 5-FU greatly enhanced the binding selectivity (k (G4-DNA)/k (ds-DNA)).

J	Ling, AF; Xu, CX				Ling, Ai-fan; Xu, Cheng-xian			A new discrete filled function method for solving large scale max-cut problems	NUMERICAL ALGORITHMS			English	Article						Combinatorial optimization; Global optimization; The max-cut problem; Filled function	GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION; MAXIMUM CUT; HEURISTICS; ALGORITHM; MINIMIZER	The global optimization method based on discrete filled function is a new method that solves large scale max-cut problems. We first define a new discrete filled function based on the structure of the max-cut problem and analyze its properties. Unlike the continuous filled function methods, by the characteristic of the max-cut problem, the parameters in the proposed filled function does not need to be adjusted. By combining a procedure that randomly generates initial points for minimization of the proposed filled function, the proposed algorithm can greatly reduce the computational time and be applied to large scale max-cut problems. Numerical results and comparisons with several heuristic methods indicate that the proposed algorithm is efficient and stable to obtain high quality solution of large scale max-cut problems.

By using the approximate analytical formulae and diffraction integral formulae, the propagation properties of an AHB in circular and rectangular apertured FRT system are studied numerically. The results show that this method provides a convenient tool for studying the propagation properties of an AHB passing through apertured FRT system, and the apertured FRT system can be applied to laser beam shaping conveniently.

It has been found that the ionic liquid provided multiple functions in the preparation of the nanocomposites: (1) the ionic liquid acts as an effective compatibilizer to significantly improve the dispersion of MWNTs in the PMMA matrix; (2) the ionic liquid is an efficient plasticizer for the prepared nanocomposites, inducing a drastically reduced glass transition temperature in the PMMA matrix; (3) the ionic liquid acts as a processing aid for the melt processing of PMMA/MWNT nanocomposites; (4) the ionic liquid increases the electrical conductivity as a dopant. This strategy is free of solvents and compatible with industrial applications, which opens new avenues for the larger-scale fabrication of polymer/carbon nanotube nanocomposites.

Spermatogenetic process in urodele amphibians was essentially like that in mammals in spite of morphological differences; however, the mechanism of germ cell apoptosis in urodele amphibians remains unknown. The Chinese fire-belly newt, Cynops orientalis, was an excellent organism for studying germ cell apoptosis due to its sensitiveness to temperature, strong endurance of starvation, and sensitive skin to heavy metal exposure. Methodology/Principal Findings: TUNEL result showed that spontaneous germ cell apoptosis took place in normal newt, and severe stress-induced apoptosis occurred to spermatids and sperm in response to heat shock (40 degrees C 2 h), cold exposure(4 degrees C 12 h), cadmium exposure(Cd 36 h), and starvation stress. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reactions (qRT-PCR) showed that gene expression of Caspase3 or Caspase7 was obviously elevated after stress treatment. Apaf1 was not altered at its gene expression level, and p53 was significantly decreased after various stress treatment. Caspase assay demonstrated that Caspase-3, -8,-9 enzyme activities in newt testis were significantly elevated after heat shock (40 degrees C 2 h), cold exposure(4 degrees C 12 h), and cadmium exposure(Cd 36 h), while Caspase3 and Caspase8 activities were increased with Caspase9 significantly decreased after starvation treatment. Conclusions/Significance: Severe germ cell apoptosis triggered by heat shock, cold exposure, and cadmium exposure was Caspase3 dependent, which probably involved both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. Apaf1 may be involved in this process without elevating its gene expression. But starvation-induced germ cell apoptosis was likely mainly through extrinsic pathway. p53 was probably not responsible for stress-induced germ cell apoptosis in newt testis. The intriguing high occurrence of spermatid and sperm apoptosis probably resulted from the sperm morphology and unique reproduction policy of Chinese fire-belly newt, Cynops orientalis.

However, there is no direct evidence on whether perceptual grouping could occur without awareness. To answer this question, we investigated whether a Kanizsa triangle (an example of perceptual grouping) is processed differently from stimuli with the same local components but are ungrouped or weakly grouped. Specifically, using a suppression time paradigm we tested whether a Kanizsa triangle would emerge from interocular continuous flash suppression sooner than control stimuli. Results show a significant advantage of the Kanizsa triangle: the Kanizsa triangle emerged from suppression noise significantly faster than the control stimulus with the local Pacmen randomly rotated (t(9) = -2.78, p = 0.02); and also faster than the control stimulus with all Pacmen rotated 180 degrees (t(11) = -3.20, p<0.01). Additional results demonstrated that the advantage of the grouped Kanizsa triangle could not be accounted for by the faster detection speed at the conscious level for the Kanizsa figures on a dynamic noise background. Our results indicate that certain properties supporting perceptual grouping could be processed in the absence of awareness.

The expanded adipose tissue mass associated with obesity is the result of hyperplasia and hypertrophy of adipocytes. In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term HFD on adipocyte progenitor cell (APC) population and adipose-specific gene profiles in both white and brown adipose, and the role of perivascular adipose in the alteration of vascular function in response to HFD. Main methods: Male C57BL/6 mice were fed a standard normal diet (ND) or HFD for about 8 Months. Glucose metabolism was assessed by an intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test. APC population and adipose-related gene profile were evaluated, and vascular function was measured in the presence or absence of perivascular adipose. Adiponectin and AMPK activity were also investigated. Key findings: HFD induced insulin resistance and glucose intolerance, and resulted in a decrease in APC population in brown, but not in white adipose tissue, when compared with animals fed a ND, with differential alterations of white and brown adipocyte-specific gene expression in brown and white adipose. Additionally, HFD led to altered vascular function in arteries in the presence of perivascular adipose tissue, which is associated with increased superoxide production. Adiponectin and AMPK activity were significantly decreased in response to long-term HFD. Significance: These findings suggest that long-term high-fat intake differentially alters adipocyte progenitor population and adipose-related gene expression in adipose tissue, and adiponectin-AMPK signaling might be involved. In addition, HFD induces changes in perivascular adipose-mediated vascular function. (c) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

We use this exact method to reexamine the entanglement dynamics of two qubits interacting with a common bath, which was previously solved only under the rotating-wave and single-excitation approximations.

The black-spined toad, Bufo melanostictus, is one of the most common amphibians in Southeast Asia and is frequently observed in human habitations throughout its distributional range. The advertisement calls of the toad have not been well described. Here, we report the advertisement calls of this species from Lishui, Zhejiang, China during its breeding season. The advertisement calls of B. melanostictus are composed of single notes with a single harmonic frequency emitted sporadically. The call parameters recorded in this study were highly variable across recording times and with different body sizes. Dominant frequency was negatively correlated with body size. Comparing the calls of the B. melanostictus population from Lishui with the populations from five other localities (Bangkok, Thailand; Coorg, India; Burma, Myanmar; Bali, Indonesia; Halimun-Salak National Park, Indonesia), we found that call structure was similar among five different populations with no harmonics, while the Halimun-Salak National Park population contained two clear harmonics. Dominant frequency was similar between Bali (1.56 kHz) and Coorg (1.6 kHz) populations, while it was highly variable among other populations. Besides call duration, call interval and pulse/call rate may also be significantly different among the comparing populations. Pooling the available data, we observed some similarities and differences in call parameters among the six populations.

This approach is rooted at the Feynman-Vernon influence functional path integral formalism, but much more implementable numerically and operationally for the study of various complex molecular dynamics and quantum transport in strongly correlated electronic systems. By construction, HEOM resolves nonperturbatively the combined effects of many-particle interaction, system-bath coupling,and non-Markovian memory. Finally the practicality of HEOM to address physical and chemical problems is exemplified with a model simulation of coherent two-dimensional spectroscopy signals of a biological light-harvesting system and a time-dependent quantum transport system involving dynamic Kondo transition.

Recent work has revealed insight on the genetic and molecular components essential for cell-to-cell movement of RNA silencing in Arabidopsis. Using a local RNA silencing assay, we report on a distinct mechanism that may govern the short-range (6-10 cell) trafficking of virus-induced RNA silencing from epidermal to neighbouring palisade and spongy parenchyma cells in Nicotiana benthamiana. This process involves a previously unrecognised function of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) gene. Our data suggest that plants may have evolved distinct genetic controls in intercellular RNA silencing among different types of cells.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the changes of CD8 alpha(+) T cells in dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mice pretreated by oral immune regulation. Methods The effects of five low oral doses of colitis-extracted proteins (CEP) on colitis were evaluated by clinical manifestation and histological lesions. The percentages of CD8 alpha(+) T cells gating on CD3(+) T cells were evaluated in the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) and the spleens by flow cytometry. Differences between the two groups were compared by Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test. Results Compared to bovine serum albumin (BSA)-fed control mice, administration of CEP resulted in marked alleviation of colitis. The proportion of CD8 alpha(+) T cells, not only in intraepithelial lymphocytes (IELs) and lamina propria lymphocytes (LPLs) of the large intestine (LI) but also in spleen from CEP-fed colitis mice, was significantly higher than that from BSA-fed colitis mice (LI-IELs: (71.5 +/- 5.4)% vs. (60.1 +/- 4.3)%, P<0.01; LI-LPLs: (60.7 +/- 5.2)% vs. (51.9 +/- 4.7)%, P <0.01; spleen: (24.1 +/- 3.6)% vs. (20.3 +/- 4.1)%, P <0.05; n=8). Mucosal repair in repair-period mice five days after termination of DSS treatment was also accompanied by an increase of CD8 alpha(+) T cells in large intestinal mucosal lymphocytes (LI-IELs: (72.1 3.7)% vs. (61.5 4.5)%, P<0.01; LI-LPLs: (62.1 +/- 5.7)% vs. (52.7 +/- 3.6)%, P<0.01; n=8). The proportion of CD3(+) T cells increased in Peyer's patches (PPs) and decreased in mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) from colitis mice compared to untreated mice, whereas the change pattern of CD3(+) T cells in PPs and MLNs from CEP-fed colitis mice was just on the contrary. Conclusion Improvement of DSS-induced colitis resulted from oral immune regulation is associated with an increase in CD8 alpha(+) T cells in spleen and large intestinal mucosa.

Evidence is provided for a possible phase separation into the magnetic majority and minority phases. It is demonstrated that the magnetic moments of the divalent Fe atoms located at the 16i site (space group I4/m) of the majority phase and of the minority phase are antiferromagnetically ordered, with the Neel temperature T-N = 518.0(3.6) K. The magnetic moments at 5.0 K of 2.09(1) and 2.28(2) mu(B) in these two phases are tilted from the crystallographic c axis by 18(1)degrees and 32(2)degrees, respectively.

Due to the nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility in cytoplasmic male-sterile (CMS) plants, we employed CMS Brassica juncea to investigate the retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in this study. We studied how reduced BjRCE1 gene expression caused by the nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility altered the auxin response in CMS of B. juncea. We isolated the BjRCE1 gene that was located in the nucleus from B. juncea. Over-expression of BjRCE1 enhanced auxin response in transgenic Arabidopsis. The expression of BjRCE1 was significantly reduced in CMS compared with its maintainer fertile (MF) line of B. juncea. There were fewer lateral roots in CMS than MF under normal and treatment of indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) conditions. Expression patterns of several auxin-related genes together with their phenotypes indicated a reduced auxin response in CMS compared to MF. The phenotypes of auxin response and auxin-related gene expression pattern could be mimicked by inhibiting mitochondrial function in MF. Taken together, we proposed reduced expression of BjRCE1 gene modulated by nuclear-cytoplasmic incompatibility alters auxin response in CMS B. juncea. This may be an important mechanism of retrograde regulation of nuclear gene expression in plants.

Previous studies revealed that the negative selection, RNA recombination and gene flow were the most important forces that drove CTV evolution. However, the CTV codon usage was not studied and thus its role in CTV evolution remains unknown. Results: A detailed comparative analysis of CTV codon usage pattern was done in this study. Results of the study show that although in general CTV does not have a high degree of codon usage bias, the codon usage of CTV has a high level of resemblance to its host codon usage. In addition, our data indicate that the codon usage resemblance is only observed for the woody plant-infecting closteroviruses but not the closteroviruses infecting the herbaceous host plants, suggesting the existence of different virus-host interactions between the herbaceous plant-infecting and woody plant-infecting closteroviruses. Conclusion: Based on the results, we suggest that in addition to RNA recombination, negative selection and gene flow, host plant codon usage selection can also affect CTV evolution.

We observe (i) the peak feature of phonon emission Franck-Condon sidebands to the zero-phonon peaks of both polaron and bipolaron in sequential electron transport; (ii) phonon absorption peaks occurring if the phonon temperature is sufficiently higher than that of the carrier electron; and (iii) the step feature of Raman sidebands in the cotunneling transport regime. We also evaluate the polaron transport response to a continuous-wave irradiation that induces bias-voltage oscillation. We observe, consistent with experimental results, that (iv) the photon-phonon-assisted tunneling enhances phonon absorptions while suppressing emissions. As the phonon absorption (emission) is associated with the process of absorbing (emitting) energy from (to) the phonon environment, an alternating or tailored field applied to contacts could be a practical means of cooling the mesoscopic quantum-transport device.

Effect of Zn impurity in K0.8Fe2-delta-xZnxSe2	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; CS	A series of K0.8Fe2-delta-xZnxSe2 single-crystal samples with nominal compositions 0 <= x <= 0.05 were grown and their physical properties were measured in order to study the effect of Zn impurity. It is found that the Zn impurity (x <= 0.02) does not affect the superconducting transition temperature T-c significantly. Meanwhile the hump in resistivity which corresponds to the transition from the insulating to metallic phase quickly shifts towards low temperatures. The results imply that there should be a phase separation in this system and Zn impurity causes the enhancement of the insulating phase. The negligible effect of Zn impurity on T-c suggests an s-wave pairing in the superconducting phase. Meanwhile there is a possibility that the Zn impurity may selectively enter into the insulting phase.	[Li, Y. K.; Shen, C. Y.; Guo, H. J.; Lv, C.; Yang, X. J.; Luo, Y. K.; Cao, G. H.; Xu, Z.

The resulting PMPTS-grafted silica hybrid nanoparticles were characterized using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIRS), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), gel permeation chromatography (GPC), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), static water contact angle (WCA) measurement, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). Combined FTIRS, NMR, XPS, SEM, and TGA studies confirmed that these hybrid nanoparticles were successfully prepared by surface-initiated ATRP. SEM and AFM studies revealed that the surfaces of the nanoparticles were rough at the nanoscale. In addition, the results of the static WCA measurements showed that the nanoparticles are of low surface energy and their surface energy reaches as low as 6.10 mN m-1.

In the present study, the spatiotemporal expression pattern of FAM110C and its potential role were examined during the periovulatory period. Immature female rats were injected with equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and ovaries or granulosa cells were collected at various times after hCG administration (n = 3/time point). Expression levels of Fam110c mRNA and protein were highly induced both in intact ovaries and granulosa cells at 8 to 12 h after hCG treatment. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated Fam110c mRNA expression was induced in theca and granulosa cells at 4 h after hCG, primarily localized to granulosa cells at 8 h and 12 h, and decreased at 24 h after hCG. There was negligible Fam110c mRNA detected in newly forming corpora lutea. In rat granulosa cell cultures, hCG induced expression of Fam110c mRNA was inhibited by RU486, whereas NS398 and AG1478 had no effect, suggesting that Fam110c expression is regulated in part by the progesterone receptor pathway. Promoter activity analysis revealed that an Sp1 site was important for the induction of Fam110c expression by hCG. Overexpression of FAM110C promoted granulosa cells to arrest at the G(1) phase of the cell cycle but did not change progesterone levels. In summary, hCG induces Fam110c mRNA expression in granulosa cells by activation of an Sp1-binding site and the actions of progesterone. Our findings suggest that FAM110C may control granulosa cell differentiation into luteal cells by arresting cell cycle progression.

The results also show that the presence of :SWNTs affects Ostwald ripening of the catalyst metal clusters and that, under certain conditions, the net diffusion may be from larger to smaller clusters.

These shocks, with the exception of the highest substrate shock, weakened the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) but improved the nitrogen removal rate by 0.01-0.18 g l(-1) h(-1). The communities and the location of the sludge may be altered by distinct types of shocks. The substrate vibration data showed that the reactor was unresponsive to hydraulic shocks but sensitive to substrate shocks and the former compartments were more susceptible to the shocks. In the inhibition period, the pH and NRE of the reactor were related to the residual ammonium and free ammonia (FA) and FA was a factor in the reactor fluctuations. The Gaussian model proposed to describe the shocks response fits the experimental data well. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and scanned participants performing lexical decision tasks to discriminate between real Chinese words and non-words, presented either visually or auditorily. For the visual task, two left inferior frontal cortical regions were significantly more activated, for non-words than for words, one in BA (Brodmann's area) 44/45 implied in phonological processing, and one in BA47 implied in semantic processing. For the auditory task, stronger neural activity for non-words, relative to words, was only found in BA44/45 but not in BA47. The results were interpreted to suggest that printed words in Chinese can directly activate their semantic representations, independent of an indirect, mediated pathway through phonology. In reference to related imaging studies on English, our finding implies a greater reliance on orthography in Chinese reading. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The chromophores are designed to prevent intermolecular pp stacking interaction and enhance fluorescence in the solid state. Single crystals of 1?a and 2?b for X-ray structural analysis were obtained, and weak pp stacking interactions of the neighboring BODIPY molecules were observed. Spectroscopic properties of all of the dyes in various solvents and in films were investigated. Triphenylsilylphenyl-substituted BODIPYs generally show more pronounced increases in solid-state emission than triphenylsilylphenyl(ethynyl)-substituted BODIPYs. Although the simple BODIPYs do not exhibit any fluorescence in the solid state (F=0), arylsilyl-substituted BODIPYs exhibit weak to moderate solid-state fluorescence with quantum yields of 0.03, 0.07, 0.10, and 0.25. The structureproperty relationships were analyzed on the basis of X-ray crystallography, optical spectroscopy, cyclic voltammetry, and theoretical calculations.

Thirty db/db mice were randomized into 5 equal groups: model control group (MCG), positive control group 30 mg/kg pioglitazone hydrochloride (PCG), low-dose rutin group 50 mg/kg (LRT), middle-dose rutin group 100 mg/kg (MRT), high-dose rutin group 200 mg/kg (HRT), and 6 other db/m mice were used as the normal control (NC). The expression of PPAR gamma mRNA and protein in the skeletal muscle was determined by real-time quantitative PCR and Western Blot, respectively. Treatment with HRT resulted in significant decreases in the plasma levels of glucose and lipids (p < 0.001). Compared to the MCG, the expression of PPAR gamma mRNA and protein of the skeletal muscle was significantly increased in the HRT and PCG groups (p < 0.001 and p < 0.05, respectively). Rutin can increase the expression of PPAR gamma in skeletal muscles of db/db mice.

The tetraphenylsilole moieties were linked at their 2,5-positions through a vinylene bridge with p-dialkoxybenzenes to obtain polymer PSVB and with 3,6-carbazole to obtain polymer PSVC. For comparison, 2,5-tetraphenylsilole-ethyne-type polymer PSEB was also synthesized, in which the vinylene bridge of PSVB was replaced with an ethyne bridge. Very interestingly, the bridging group (vinylene or ethyne) had a significant effect on the photophysical properties of the corresponding polymers. The fluorescence peak of PSEB at 504 nm in solution originated from the emission of its silole moieties, whereas PSVB and PSVC emitted yellow light and no blueishgreen emission from the silole moieties was observed, thus demonstrating that the emissions of PSVB and PSVC were due to their polymer backbones. More importantly, the 2,5-tetraphenylsilole-ethyne polymer exhibited a pronounced aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE) effect but the 2,5-tetraphenylsilole-vinylene polymer was AEE-inactive. Moreover, both AEE-active 2,5-tetraphenylsilole-ethyne polymer and AEE-inactive 2,5-tetraphenylsilole-vinylene polymers were successfully applied as fluorescent chemosensors for the detection of explosive compounds.

The constructive interference of the Airy beams in the near-and far-zone is explicitly analyzed by varying the chirality parameter of the medium.

Calculations showed the a(2) ions generated from b(2) ions were cyclic, which is energetically more favorable than the linear form. The prolyl residue in the structure affected the energy hypersurface of the dissociation reaction from the b(2) ion to the a(2) ion. In the fragmentation of a(2) ions, the iminium-imine complex corresponding to loss of CO from the a(2) ion was suggested to be an ion-neutral complex (INC). The a(1) ion was generated from direct separation of this INC, and the internal iminium ion, which was absent in PGG, was generated from another INC that was formed from the first INC via proton-bridged complex-mediated intramolecular proton transfer. Although these intermediates are unstable, their existence is supported by experiments and density functional theory calculations.

All-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) can enhance or attenuate some ERS-induced physiological or pathological changes. Our previous studies showed that there was UPR in short forelimbs induced by ATRA. Many kinds of malformations induced by ATRA may correlate with cell death, and knowing that UPR is closely associated with cell death, so we speculate that the short forelimbs may caused by UPR-induced cell death. To test this hypothesis, the present study investigated the expression of UPR-related genes and proteins in the same short forelimb malformation model to determine whether ATRA-induced short forelimb malformation occurred through UPR-induced cell death. Subsequently, we further observed the differentiation and proliferation of chondrocytes and the expression of related genes and/or proteins. It was found that ATRA evoked UPR in this short forelimb model, thus activating the anti-cell death pathway and inhibiting the cell death-promoting pathway. Cell death was not evident in short forelimb, and ATRA inhibited the expression of Ccnb1 and Ccna1, thus retarding chondrocyte maturation. As a result, the number of immature chondrocytes in short forelimb was greater than the normal level. We therefore believe that ATRA induces short forelimb malformation most likely by inhibiting chondrocyte maturation rather than by evoking excess cell death. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To study glycogen metabolism pathway in Spodoptera exigua, first cDNAs for glycogen synthase (SpoexGS) and glycogen phosphorylase (SpoexGP) were cloned from S. exigua. SpoexGS cDNA contains an open reading frame of 2,010 nucleotides encoding a protein of 669 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 76.19 kDa and a pI of 5.84. SpoexGP contains an open reading frame of 2,946 nucleotides, which encodes a protein of 841 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of approximately 96.63 kDa and a pI of 6.03. Second, Northern blotting revealed that SpoexGS and SpoexGP mRNAs were expressed in brain, fat body, mid-gut, Malpighian tubules, spermary, and tracheae of S. exigua. Expression patterns for SpoexGS and SpoexGP mRNAs were similar in fat body, but differed in whole body at different developmental stages. The last, under starvation conditions, SpoexGS and SpoexGP transcript expression rapidly decreased with increasing starvation time. When the starvation stress was removed, SpoexGS and SpoexGP mRNA levels were lower in the groups starved for 6 and 12 h than in the 24-h starvation and control groups. Treatment with excessive sugar intake led to higher levels of SpoexGS and SpoexGP transcripts after 12 h compared to the control group. These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns, and potential function of glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase proteins. (c) 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Z to E isomerization was carried out smoothly and resulted in geometrically pure substituted olefins. Apart from the cistrans isomerization of double bonds, the selective reduction of terminal olefins and activated alkenes was performed with excellent functional group tolerance in the presence of an amide-derived olefin ligand, and the products were obtained in high isolated yields (up to >99?%). Furthermore, the palladium/hydrosilane system was able to promote the reductive decarbonylation of benzoyl chloride when a (Z)-olefin with an aromatic amide moiety was used as a ligand.

Chilling injury index, malondialdehyde (MDA) content, and ion leakage of fruit treated with 0.5 g/L YS were significantly reduced as compared with those of control fruit stored at 4 degrees C, showing that YS treatment may reduce chilling injury in cucumber. Moreover, treatment with YS triggered a marked increase in endogenous NO levels. An NO scavenger and NO synthase inhibitors not only diminished YS-triggered NO generation but also suppressed VS-enhanced cold tolerance. Together, our results indicate that YS could have potential postharvest application for reducing chilling injury in cucumber fruit. Furthermore, we found that YS-induced cold tolerance is linked with the induction of endogenous NO accumulation. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Lenhard			Telomere dysfunctional environment induces loss of quiescence and inherent impairments of hematopoietic stem cell function	AGING CELL			English	Article						telomere; aging; stem cell; quiescence; systemic environment	SELF-RENEWAL; CANCER	Previous studies have shown that telomere dysfunction induces alteration in the systemic (circulatory) environment impairing the differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) but these defects can be reverted by re-exposing HSCs to an environment with functional telomeres. In contrast, HSC intrinsic telomere dysfunction induces permanent and irreversible limitations in the repopulation capacity partially depending on the induction of checkpoints such as cell cycle arrest, differentiation, or apoptosis. It is currently unknown whether telomere dysfunctional environment can induce irreversible, cell intrinsic defects impairing the function of HSCs. Here, we analyzed the functional reserves of murine, wild-type HSCs with intact telomeres that were transiently exposed to a telomere dysfunctional environment (late generation telomerase knockout mice) or to an environment with functional telomeres (wild-type mice). The study shows that the telomere dysfunctional environment leads to irreversible impairments in the repopulation capacity of wild-type HSCs. The telomere dysfunctional environment impaired the maintenance of HSC quiescent. Moreover, the study shows that alterations in the systemic (circulatory) environment rather than the bone stromal niche induce loss of stem cell quiescence and irreversible deficiencies of HSCs exposed to a telomere dysfunctional environment.

The relative activities of the immobilised enzyme were 144.7 and 141.9% when the post-immobilisation modification was done with Arg and Phe, respectively. The residual activity of immobilised DERA after heating at 60 A degrees C for 120 min was 65.1% when Phe and Val were used as the blocking amino acids, a 2.0- and 2.87-fold increase over that of the immobilised (no post-immobilisation blocking) and free DERA. Immobilised DERA maintained maximal activity in 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate (DR5P) synthesis up to 600 mM of acetaldehyde, which was much higher than the amount of acetaldehyde tolerated by free enzyme (300 mM). This superior resistance to high acetaldehyde concentrations would accelerate the DR5P reaction by shifting the reaction equilibrium towards the product. The results from this study suggest that the novel immobilised DERA may be useful for industrial applications.

Under optimum condition, the alkyne polyhydrosilylation reactions progress efficiently and regioselectively, yielding polymers with high molecular weights (M-w up to 95,300) and good stereoregularity (E content close to 99%) in high yields (up to 92%). The polymers are processable and thermally stable, with high decomposition temperatures in the range of 420-449 degrees C corresponding to 5% weight loss. They are weakly fluorescent in the solution state but become emissive in the aggregate and film states, demonstrating their aggregation-enhanced emission characteristics. The explosive sensing capabilities of the polymers are examined in both solution and aggregate states. The emissions of the polymers aggregates in aqueous mixture are quenched more efficiently by picric acid in an exponential pattern with high quenching constants (up to 27,949 L mol(-1)), suggesting that the polymers aggregates are sensitive chemosensors for explosive detection.

The expression of CTR1 gene was reduced in CMS compared with male-fertile (MF) lines. We observed that hypocotyl and root lengths were shorter than in the MF line during germination in the dark. An enhanced ethylene response was observed in CMS plants as shown by the CMS and maintainer line phenotypes treated with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid. The phenotype in CMS plants could be recovered to the maintainer line when treated with Ag+. One ethylene response gene, plant defensin gene, was detected to be induced in CMS. The behavior of this phenotype could be mimicked by treating the maintainer line with antimycin A that disturbs mitochondrial function, which showed reduced length of hypocotyl and roots, and resulted in similar expression patterns of ethylene-related genes as in CMS. The reduced length of hypocotyl and roots could be recovered to the maintainer line by treatment with gibberellic acid (GA3). In addition, the GA3 content was reduced in CMS plants and in the MF line treated with antimycin A. Ethylene treatment markedly affects GA3 content; however, GA3 did not significantly affect ethylene-related gene expression in regards to regulation of hypocotyl and root length, which suggests that ethylene acts upstream via gibberellin to regulate hypocotyls and root development. Taken together, our results suggest a link between mitochondrial modulation of the ethylene and gibberellin pathway that regulates the development of hypocotyl and roots.

J	Pan, Y; Cheng, QP; Luo, QY				Pan, Yi; Cheng, Qiu-Ping; Luo, Qian-Ying			Working memory can enhance unconscious visual perception	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Article						Working memory; Unconscious perception; Awareness; Attention	NEURAL MECHANISMS; ATTENTION; AWARENESS; GUIDANCE; EXTINCTION; SELECTION; CAPTURE	We demonstrate that unconscious processing of a stimulus property can be enhanced when there is a match between the contents of working memory and the stimulus presented in the visual field. Participants first held a cue (a colored circle) in working memory and then searched for a brief masked target shape presented simultaneously with a distractor shape. When participants reported having no awareness of the target shape at all, search performance was more accurate in the valid condition, where the target matched the cue in color, than in the neutral condition, where the target mismatched the cue. This effect cannot be attributed to bottom-up perceptual priming from the presentation of a memory cue, because unconscious perception was not enhanced when the cue was merely perceptually identified but not actively held in working memory. These findings suggest that reentrant feedback from the contents of working memory modulates unconscious visual perception.

The mesopores were generated by adding micelle swelling agent, 1,3,5-trimethyl benzene, during the synthesis and removing it afterward, which was demonstrated to greatly increase the HOC removal efficiency. In this material, TPODAC surfactant is directly anchored on the pore surface of mesoporous silica via -Si-O-Si- covalent bond after the synthesis due to its reactive -Si-(OCH3)(3) head group, and thus makes the synthesized materials can be easily regenerated for reuse. The obtained materials show great potential in water treatment as pollutants sorbents. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Recently, Chen and Sanguansat (2011) [Chen, S. M. & Sanguansat, K. (2011). Analyzing fuzzy risk based on a new fuzzy ranking method between generalized fuzzy numbers. Expert Systems with Applications, 38(3), (pp. 2163-2171)] proposed a method for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers. It considers the areas on the positive side, the areas on the negative side and the heights of the generalized fuzzy numbers to evaluate ranking scores of the generalized fuzzy numbers. Chen and Sanguansat's method (2011) can overcome the drawbacks of some existing methods for ranking generalized fuzzy numbers. However. in the situation when the score is zero, the results of the Chen and Sanguansat's ranking method (2011) ranking method are unreasonable. The aim of this short note is to give a modification on Chen and Sanguansat's method (2011) to make the method more reasonable. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The mathematical description of these phenomena leads to impulsive differential equations. In this paper, we present a new approach via the well-known Poincare-Birkhoff theorem to obtain the existence of periodic solutions to impulsive problems. We consider an impulsive Duffing equation, and find the possibility of applying a generalized form of the Poincare-Birkhoff theorem due to Ding to construct infinitely many periodic solutions of the impulsive Duffing equation even in a resonance case.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurements of the Mass and Width of the eta(c) Using the Decay psi (3686) -> gamma eta(c)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							FINAL-STATES; COLLISIONS; MESONS	The mass and width of the lowest-lying S-wave spin singlet charmonium state, the eta(c), are measured using a data sample of 1: 06 x 10(8) psi (3686) decays collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage ring. We use a model that incorporates full interference between the signal reaction, psi(3686) -> gamma eta(c), and a nonresonant radiative background to describe the line shape of the eta(c) successfully. We measure the n(c) mass to be 2984.3 +/- 0.6 +/- 0.6 MeV/c(2) and the total width to be 32.0 +/- 1.2 +/- 1.0 MeV, where the first errors are statistical and the second are systematic.

The low-energy impurity behavior is investigated by using the numerical renormalization group method developed for arbitrary electronic bath spectra. The results explicitly show that the local impurity state is completely screened upon the nonzero current intensity. The impurity quantum criticality is in accordance with the well-known Kosterlitz-Thouless transition.

J	Yang, CP				Yang, Chui-Ping			Fast quantum information transfer with superconducting flux qubits coupled to a cavity	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS A-MATHEMATICAL AND THEORETICAL			English	Article							STATE	We present away to realize quantum information transfer with superconducting flux qubits coupled to a cavity. Because only resonant qubit-cavity and qubit-pulse interactions are applied, the information transfer can be performed much faster when compared with the previous proposals. This proposal does not require adjustment of the qubit level spacings during the operation. Moreover, neither uniformity in the device parameters nor exact placement of qubits in the cavity are needed.

J	Meng, YJ; Shao, CG; Wang, HZ; Jin, YF				Meng, Yijun; Shao, Chaogang; Wang, Huizhong; Jin, Yongfeng			Target mimics: an embedded layer of microRNA-involved gene regulatory networks in plants	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Target mimic; Network; Subnetwork; MicroRNA; Degradome; Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana); Rice (Oryza sativa)	PARALLEL ANALYSIS; MESSENGER-RNA; ARABIDOPSIS; SEQUENCE; EXPRESSION; DATABASE; IDENTIFICATION; TRANSCRIPTOME; CONSTRUCTION; RESOURCES	Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in gene regulation in plants. At the same time, the expression of miRNA genes is also tightly controlled. Recently, a novel mechanism called "target mimicry" was discovered, providing another layer for modulating miRNA activities. However, except for the artificial target mimics manipulated for functional studies on certain miRNA genes, only one example, IPS1 (Induced by Phosphate Starvation 1)-miR399 was experimentally confirmed in planta. To date, few analyses for comprehensive identification of natural target mimics have been performed in plants. Thus, limited evidences are available to provide detailed information for interrogating the questionable issue whether target mimicry was widespread in planta, and implicated in certain biological processes. Results: In this study, genome-wide computational prediction of endogenous miRNA mimics was performed in Arabidopsis and rice, and dozens of target mimics were identified. In contrast to a recent report, the densities of target mimic sites were found to be much higher within the untranslated regions (UTRs) when compared to those within the coding sequences (CDSs) in both plants. Some novel sequence characteristics were observed for the miRNAs that were potentially regulated by the target mimics. GO (Gene Ontology) term enrichment analysis revealed some functional insights into the predicted mimics. After degradome sequencing data-based identification of miRNA targets, the regulatory networks constituted by target mimics, miRNAs and their downstream targets were constructed, and some intriguing subnetworks were further exploited. Conclusions: These results together suggest that target mimicry may be widely implicated in regulating miRNA activities in planta, and we hope this study could expand the current understanding of miRNA-involved regulatory networks.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for a light exotic particle in J/psi radiative decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GRAVITINO; ENERGIES	Using a data sample containing 1.06 x 10(8) psi' events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII electron-positron collider, we search for a light exotic particle X in the process psi' -> pi(+)pi-J/psi, J/psi -> gamma X, X -> mu(+)mu(-). This light particle X could be a Higgs-like boson A(0), a spin-1 U boson, or a pseudoscalar sgoldstino particle. In this analysis, we find no evidence for any mu(+)mu-mass peak between the mass threshold and 3.0 GeV/c(2). We set 90%-confidence-level upper limits on the product-branching fractions for J/psi -> gamma A(0), A(0) -> mu(+)mu-which range from 4 x 10(-7) to 2.1 x 10(-5), depending on the mass of A(0), for M(A(0)) < 3.0 GeV/c(2). Only one event is seen in the mass region below 255 MeV/c(2), and this has mu(+)mu-mass of 213.3 MeV/c(2) and the product-branching-fraction upper limit 5 x 10(-7).	[Ablikim, M.; An, F. F.; An, Z.

We investigated the application of metabolomics in distinguishing EOC and BOT and tried to discover valuable biomarkers. Methods: Plasma metabolomic profiling was performed using ultra-performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (UPLC/MS). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis was employed to classify EOC and BOT, and reveal their metabolic differences. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) was utilized to evaluate the predictive performance of the metabolic profiles for external validation set. Results: The metabolomic profiles consisting of 535 metabolites revealed a clear separation between EOC and BOT, with AUC of 0.86 for the external validation set. 6 metabolic biomarkers were identified, and the plasma concentrations of the 4 ascertained biomarkers (L-tryptophan, LysoPC(18:3), LysoPC(14:0), and 2-Piperidinone) were lower in EOC patients than those in BOT patients. Among them, tryptophan and LysoPC have been suspected to participate in cancer progression, and 2-Piperidinone might be a novel biomarker for EOC. Conclusions: Metabolomics could be used to discriminate EOC from BOT in clinical practice, and the identified metabolic biomarkers might be important on investigating the biological mechanisms of EOC.

The intermediates, including [Ni2+ M (SCH3)(-) (CH3CN)](+) (m/z 356) and [Ni2+ (M-H)(-)](+) (m/z 267), in both the associative and the dissociative pathways have been obtained in the tandem MS, indicating that the two mechanistic pathways are efficient in the ligand exchange reactions. The electronic effect of the phenyl substituent on the reactivity of [Ni2+ (M*-H)(-)](+) has also been investigated by mass selection in the MS4 experiments. Intra-complex proton transfer to the anion ligand (SCH3)(-) is essential for the ligand exchange reactions. D-labeling experiments confirmed that the transferring proton comes from either the thioamide proton, or the phenyl proton via C-sp2-H activation leading to cyclometallated complexes. DFT calculations at uB3LYP/6-31+G(2d, p) level gave the key species and the potential energy surfaces for the model reaction system of CI-a and acetonitrile. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

In this methodology, an asymmetric weighted LSSVM model is first proposed. Then the process of building the EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology is described in detail. Two publicly available software defect datasets are finally used for illustration and verification of the effectiveness of the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology. Experimental results reveal that the proposed EP-based asymmetric weighted LSSVM ensemble learning methodology can produce promising classification accuracy in software repository mining, relative to other classification methods listed in this study.

The methylphenyl vinyl silicone resin was synthesized by cohydrolysis of MePhSiCl2 with Me2SiCl2, MeViSiCl(2) and PhSiCl3 then by co-condensation polymerization catalyzed by KOH and end-capped with Me3SiCl. Then the silicone material for LED packaging was prepared with the produced methylphenyl vinyl silicone resin, methylphenyl hydrosilicone oil and Karstedt's catalyst. The methylphenyl vinyl silicone resins were characterized by FTIR and H-1 NMR. The silicone resins prepared with very high transmittance at range of 400-800 nm after cured. The LED packaged with the silicone resin-type materials exhibited higher luminous flux, higher light efficiency, narrower color-rendering index and higher color-temperature consistency.

Transitions from metallic Fermi liquid behavior to non-Fermi liquid behavior and from antiferromagnetism to paramagnetism are found in the pressure range of 9.2-10.3 GPa, in which superconductivity tends to disappear. The change around the quantum critical point from the coexisting antiferromagnetism state and the Fermi liquid behavior to the paramagnetism state and the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the iron-selenide superconductors demonstrates a unique mechanism for their quantum critical transition.

However, recent studies have suggested that the effects of 5-HTTLPR may be specific to different ethnic groups. Few studies have been conducted to address this issue. Methodology/Principal Findings: Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was conducted on thirty-eight healthy Han Chinese subjects (l/l group, n = 19; s/s group, n = 19) during the resting state and during an emotional processing task. Compared with the s/s group, the l/l group showed significantly increased regional homogeneity or local synchronization in the right amygdala during the resting state (vertical bar t vertical bar. 2.028, p<0.05, corrected), but no significant difference was found in the bilateral amygdala in response to negative stimuli in the emotional processing task. Conclusions/Significance: 5-HTTLPR can alter the spontaneous activity of the amygdala in Han Chinese. However, the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala both in task state and resting state in Asian population was no similar with Caucasians. They suggest that the effect of 5-HTTLPR on the amygdala may be modulated by ethnic differences.

Upper Critical Magnetic Field far above the Paramagnetic Pair-Breaking Limit of Superconducting One-Dimensional Li0.9Mo6O17 Single Crystals	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							DENSITY-WAVE; BRONZE; DEPENDENCE; ELECTRON; SPIN	The upper critical field H-c2 of purple bronze Li0.9Mo6O17 is found to exhibit a large anisotropy, in quantitative agreement with that expected from the observed electrical resistivity anisotropy. With the field aligned along the most conducting axis, H-c2 increases monotonically with decreasing temperature to a value 5 times larger than the estimated paramagnetic pair-breaking field. Theories for the enhancement of H-c2 invoking spin-orbit scattering or strong-coupling superconductivity are shown to be inadequate in explaining the observed behavior, suggesting that the pairing state in Li0.9Mo6O17 is unconventional and possibly spin triplet.

BESIII Collaboration	First Observation of eta(1405) Decays into f(0)(980)pi(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							MESONS; SEARCH; STATES; REST	The decays J/psi -> gamma pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) and J/psi ->gamma pi(0)pi(0)pi(0) are analyzed using a sample of 225 X 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector. The decay of eta(1405) -> f(0)(980)pi(0) with a large isospin violation is observed for the first time. The width of the f(0)(980) observed in the dipion mass spectra is anomalously narrower than the world average. Decay rates for three-pion decays of the eta' are also measured precisely.

Transport and thermodynamic properties of quasi-two-dimensional purple bronzes A(0.9)Mo(6)O(17) (A = Na, K)	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							DIMENSIONAL ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; DENSITY-WAVE INSTABILITY; MOLYBDENUM BRONZE; THERMAL-CONDUCTIVITY; CHARGE; EXCITATIONS; AMO(6)O(17); IMAGE	We report a comparative study of the specific heat, electrical resistivity, and thermal conductivity of the quasi-two-dimensional purple bronzes Na0.9Mo6O17 and K0.9Mo6O17, with special emphasis on the behavior near their respective charge-density-wave transition temperatures T-P. The contrasting behavior of both the transport and the thermodynamic properties near T-P is argued to arise predominantly from the different levels of intrinsic disorder in the two systems. A significant proportion of the enhancement of the thermal conductivity above T-P in Na0.9Mo6O17, and to a lesser extent in K0.9Mo6O17, is attributed to the emergence of phason excitations.

Here, we did a transcriptome-wide survey of sRNAs, mainly focusing on the microRNAs, with organ-specific expression patterns in both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice (Oryza sativa). By using sRNA HTS data generated by 454 sequencing technology, four organs in Arabidopsis (i.e. six-day-old seedling, rosette leaf, flower and silique), and four in rice (shoot apex, leaf, root apex and inflorescence) were investigated. Chromosome-wide distribution patterns of the organ-specific sRNAs were obtainted. We found that in rice, the 21-nt (nucleotide) sRNAs occupy a large portion of the sRNA population highly expressed in inflorescences. In contrast, the sRNAs not expressed in rice floral organ are predominantly 24 nt in length. Through literature mining, ath-miR156d, ath-miR400, ath-miR822 and ath-miR824 were suggested to be involved in seedling development in Arabidopsis, and osa-miR169 induced by drought and high salinity was indicated to regulate leaf growth in rice.

Our objective was to establish whether partial enterectomy and omentectomy are necessary in addition to LSG to achieve weight loss in obese patients. The setting was a case series in a provincial hospital. Methods: A total of 40 obese patients (29 women and 11 men) were separated into 2 equal groups according to patient choice. Group 1 underwent LSG alone, and group 2 underwent LSG plus partial enterectomy and omentectomy. The partial enterectomy left the first 100 cm of the jejunum and the last 200 cm of the ileum. The data were collected during the follow-up examinations, performed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Results: The body mass index loss (BMIL) was 3.9 +/- .5 kg/m(2) and 9.4 +/- 1.3 kg/m(2) at 1 and 12 months in group 1, respectively. The BMIL was 4.5.9 kg/m(2) and 10.4 +/- 1.9 kg/m(2) at 1 and 12 months in group 2, respectively. At I and 12 months postoperatively, the percntage of excess body weight loss was 32.2% +/- 12.6% and 81.5% +/- 20.4% in group 1 and 35.5% +/- 0.5% and 83.8% +/- 24.5% in group 2, respectively. Except for the BMIL at 1 month after surgery, no significant differences were found in the BMIL or percentage of excess body weight less. Conclusion: LSG with and without partial enterectomy and omentectomy in our study was an effective method of bariatric surgery, but they did not differ in their effect on weight loss. However, the long-term effect of weight loss with LSG alone or combined with partial enterectomy and omentectomy needs additional study. (Surg Obes Relat Dis 2012;8:275-281.)

We observe the nonlinear field-velocity relation, and determine the creep exponent mu. To further investigate the universality class of the creep motion, we also measure the roughness exponent zeta and energy barrier exponent psi from the zero-field relaxation process. We find that all the exponents depend on the strength of disorder. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2012	[Dong, R. H.; Zheng, B.] Zhejiang Univ, Dept Phys, Hangzhou 310027, Peoples R China; [Zhou, N.

The utility of MGSM-PCR was shown by applying it to search for homologues of the glycoside hydrolase family 9 cellulase in metagenomic DNA. The success of the multiplex PCR was verified by visualizing products on an agarose gel following gel electrophoresis. A total of 127 homologous genes were amplified with combinatorial multi-primer reactions from 34 soil DNA samples. Multiple alignments revealed extensive sequence diversity among these captured sequences with sequence identity varying from 26 to 99.7%. These results indicated that significantly diverse homologous genes were indeed readily accessible when using multiple metagenomic gene specific primers.

We have shown for the first time that the combined poly(methylhydro)siloxane-malononitrile system can serve as an efficient reductant/reagent in 1,4-conjugate reduction of enones. The regioselectivity, efficiencies, and experimental simplicity of the present method complements the more complex methods previously employed in copper or palladium-catalyzed reduction. This method should prove attractive because of its mild reaction conditions and the interesting chemistry of combining the use of poly(methylhydro)siloxane and malononitrile for selective reduction.

Coupling calcium/calmodulin-mediated signaling and herbivore-induced plant response through calmodulin-binding transcription factor AtSR1/CAMTA3	PLANT MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						Calcium; Calmodulin; Herbivore; Jasmonates; AtSR1/CAMTA3	DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; SALICYLIC-ACID; JASMONIC ACID; CROSS-TALK; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; INDUCED EXPRESSION; STRESS RESPONSES; GENE-EXPRESSION; ABIOTIC STRESS; TOMATO LEAVES	Calcium/calmodulin (Ca2+/CaM) has long been considered a crucial component in wound signaling pathway. However, very few Ca2+/CaM-binding proteins have been identified which regulate plant responses to herbivore attack/wounding stress. We have reported earlier that a family of Ca2+/CaM-binding transcription factors designated as AtSRs (also known as AtCAMTAs) can respond differentially to wounding stress. Further studies revealed that AtSR1/CAMTA3 is a negative regulator of plant defense, and Ca2+/CaM-binding to AtSR1 is indispensable for the suppression of salicylic acid (SA) accumulation and disease resistance. Here we report that Ca2+/CaM-binding is also critical for AtSR1-mediated herbivore-induced wound response. Interestingly, atsr1 mutant plants are more susceptible to herbivore attack than wild-type plants. Complementation of atsr1 mutant plants by overexpressing wild-type AtSR1 protein can effectively restore plant resistance to herbivore attack. However, when mutants of AtSR1 with impaired CaM-binding ability were overexpressed in atsr1 mutant plants, plant resistance to herbivore attack was not restored, suggesting a key role for Ca2+/CaM-binding in wound signaling. Furthermore, it was observed that elevated SA levels in atsr1 mutant plants have a negative impact on both basal and induced biosynthesis of jasmonates (JA). These results revealed that Ca2+/CaM-mediated signaling regulates plant response to herbivore attack/wounding by modulating the SA-JA crosstalk through AtSR1.

Based on analyzing the rDNA sequence, the fungus was identified as Nigrospora sp. This is the first report of the isolation of endophytic Nigrospora from M. oleifera. By bioassay-guided fractionation, four antifungal secondary metabolites were isolated from liquid cultures of the fungus Nigrospora sp. LLGLM003, and their chemical structures were determined to be griseofulvin (1), dechlorogriseofulvin (2), 8-dihydroramulosin (3) and mellein (4) on the basis of spectroscopic analyses. Compound 2, 3 and 4 were isolated from Nigrospora sp. for the first time. In vitro antifungal assay showed that griseofulvin displayed clear inhibition of the growth of 8 plant pathogenic fungi. Dechlorogriseofulvin and mellein exhibited only weak antifungal activities, whereas 8-dihydroramulosin displayed no antifungal activities.	[Wang, J. Y.; Zhang, C.

The inverse miniemulsions containing pH-controlled hydrophilic droplets were first prepared via sonication by using poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P(E/B)-PEO) or SPAN 80 as surfactant. TEOS was directly introduced to the continuous phase of an inverse mini-emulsion. The silica shell was formed by the deposition of silica on the surface of droplets. The formation of capsule morphology was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). The mesoporous structure was verified by nitrogen sorption measurements. The specific surface area could be tuned by the variation of the amount of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and TEOS, and the pore size by the amount of CTAB. The influences of synthetic parameters on the particle size and morphology were investigated in terms of the amount of CTAB, pH value in the droplets, TEOS amount, surfactant amount, and type of solvent with low polarity. A formation mechanism of silica capsules was proposed.

The aims of this study were to investigate the roles of small intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (SI-IELs) in oral tolerance and dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis. SI-IELs or sorted gamma delta T cells from untreated, colitis, and colitis-extracted protein (CEP)-fed colitis mice were adoptively transferred to BALB/c mice; colitis was then induced with DSS. Cytokines were analyzed in sera from mice and culture supernatants. Transfer of SI-IELs or sorted gamma delta T cells from untreated and colitis mice all alleviated experimental colitis. Mice orally administered with five low doses of CEP showed less severe symptoms and histological injury. SI-IELs from CEP-fed colitis mice more significantly ameliorated colitis than those from control mice (weight, 94.1 +/- 2.5% vs. 89.8 +/- 2.6%, p < 0.05; disease activity index, 7.2 +/- 1.2 vs. 8.7 +/- 1.9, p < 0.05; histological scores, 22.1 +/- 2.8 vs. 25.7 +/- 2.1, p < 0.05, n = 8 per group); however, not did SI-gamma delta IELs from CEP-fed colitis mice. Alleviation of colitis was accompanied by an increase of TGF-beta 1 secretion and no change of IFN-gamma in sera and culture supernatants. The level of serum TGF-beta 1 was negatively related to the severity of colitis. The protective effects of SI-IELs in DSS-induced colitis were partly accomplished by gamma delta T cells and could be mediated by TGF-beta but were not associated with IFN-gamma. Oral tolerance strengthens the suppressive effects of regulatory subsets in SI-IELs.

The objective of this study was to explore the genetic polymorphisms and serum protein levels of MBL in Chinese pediatric patients with common infectious diseases, including recurrent respiratory infection (RRI), acute respiratory infection (ARI), active cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, localized abscess, and otitis media. Methods: MBL genetic polymorphisms of 151 pediatric patients with infectious diseases and 105 healthy controls were detected by PCR and sequencing. Serum MBL levels of all the patients and controls were measured using a Human MBL ELISA Kit. Differences in MBL genetic polymorphisms and serum levels between patients and controls were analyzed by statistical methods. Results: The frequencies of allele H/L at position -550 of the promoter and three haplotypes - HYPA, HYPB, and LYPB - were statistically different between patients and controls (p < 0.05). The frequencies of genotypes 'YA' and 'XB', relevant to serum protein levels, were also significantly different between patients and controls (p < 0.05). Serum MBL levels of patients with active CMV infection were significantly lower than those of controls (p < 0.05). Conversely, serum MBL levels of patients with ARI and localized abscess were significantly higher than those of controls (p < 0.05). Conclusions: Genetic polymorphisms attributable to mutations in the promoter and exon 1 of the MBL2 gene appear to be relatively common in pediatric patients with infectious diseases. Low serum MBL levels may play a role in the high sensitivity of pediatric CMV infections. (C) 2012 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The response to the shock loads can be divided into three stages: a sensitive period, an interim stable period and a recovery period which lasted 6-26 d. When exposed to NaCl shocks for 12 h, the sludge retention time (SRT) of the reactor decreased with increasing NaCl shock loads, ranging between 2.9 and 22.5 d, meanwhile the biomass decreased by 0.8-37.4%. When shock loads were higher than 10 g l(-1) NaCl, the reactor was at risk of losing too much biomass. The granular surface was rough due to rapid growth of filamentous bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), also the EPS amount changed during all NaCl shock loads. In the latter of shocks, the microorganisms in the reactor showed a little adaption to the NaCl shock. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation of small mesenteric arteries of eNOS-/- was resistant to N-omega-nitro-L-arginine and indomethacin and the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor, 1H-(1,2,4) oxadiazolo (4,3-a) quinoxalin-1-one. Apamin and the combination of apamin and iberiotoxin or apamin and charybdotoxin induced a transient endothelium-dependent contraction of small mesenteric arteries from both eNOS-/- and +/+ mice. Acetylcholine-induced relaxation in eNOS-/- mice was unaffected by charybdotoxin or apamin alone but significantly inhibited by the combination of these agents. However, the combination of scyllatoxin and iberiotoxin did not mimic the inhibitory effect of the apamin/charybdotoxin combination. Tubocurarine alone completely blocked acetylcholine-induced relaxation in eNOS-/- mice. Single channel analysis of myocytes from small mesenteric arterioles revealed a large conductance calcium-activated potassium channel that was sensitive to iberiotoxin, charybdotoxin, and tetraethylammonium. Tubocurarine blocked this channel from the cytosolic side but not when applied extracellularly. Solutions of nitric oxide (NO) gas also relaxed small mesenteric arteries that had been contracted with cirazoline in a concentration-dependent manner, and the sensitivity to NO was reduced by iberiotoxin and the combination of apamin, scyllatoxin, or tubocurarine with charybdotoxin but not by apamin, charybdotoxin, scyllatoxin, or tubocurarine alone. These data indicate that acetylcholine-induced endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated relaxation in small mesenteric arteries from eNOS-/- involved the activation of tubocurarine and apamin-/charybdotoxin-sensitive K-channels. In eNOS+/+ mice, the acetylcholine-induced response was primarily mediated by NO and was sensitive to iberiotoxin and the combination of apamin and charybdotoxin.

However, the precise production of Ag NCs in a site-specific manner still remains a challenge to attain highly selective and label-free DNA recognition. Here we exploited the availability of a gap site in DNA duplexes as a new scaffold for the synthesis of Ag NCs. Compared to the commonly used DNA templates for the creation of Ag NCs, the gap site in DNA duplexes was found to facilitate the rapid formation of the fluorescent Ag NCs without sacrifice of their bright emission and excellent stability. We found that fluorescent Ag NCs were highly selectively formed when cytosine faced toward the gap site in DNA duplexes, and they were in situ utilized as readout by signal-on manner for the DNA mutation assays. This base-selective growth of the fluorescent Ag NCs at the gap site would find promising applications in practical detection of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and construction of DNA-based functional sensors with label-free and cost-effective merits.

The vulnerable Chinese cobra (Naja atra) has a distribution from the mouth of the Yangtze River down to northern Vietnam and Laos, within which several large mountain ranges and water bodies may influence population structure. We combined 12 microsatellite loci and 1117 bp of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene to explore genetic structure and demographic history in this species, using 269 individuals from various localities in Mainland China and Vietnam. High levels of genetic variation were identified for both mtDNA and microsatellites. mtDNA data revealed two main (Vietnam + southern China + southwestern China; eastern + southeastern China) and one minor (comprising only two individuals from the westernmost site) clades. Microsatellite data divided the eastern + southeastern China clade further into two genetic clusters, which include individuals from the eastern and southeastern regions, respectively. The Luoxiao and Nanling Mountains may be important barriers affecting the diversification of lineages. In the haplotype network of cytchrome b, many haplotypes were represented within a "star" cluster and this and other tests suggest recent expansion. However, microsatellite analyses did not yield strong evidence for a recent bottleneck for any population or genetic cluster. The three main clusters identified here should be considered as independent management units for conservation purposes. The release of Chinese cobras into the wild should cease unless their origin can be determined, and this will avoid problems arising from unnatural homogenization.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurement of the branching fractions of J/psi -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) and psi ' -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0)	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						BES III; Hadronic charmonium decays	RHO-PI PUZZLE; FINAL-STATES; DECAYS	We study the decays of the J/psi and psi' mesons to pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) using data samples at both resonances collected with the BES III detector in 2009. We measure the corresponding branching fractions with unprecedented precision and provide mass spectra and Dalitz plots. The branching fraction for J/psi -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) is determined to be (2.137 +/- 0.004 (stat.)(-0.056)(+0.058) (syst.)(-0.026)(+0.027) (norm.)) x 10(-2), and the branching fraction for psi' -> pi(+)pi(-)pi(0) is measured as (2.14 +/- 0.03 (stat.)(-0.07)(+0.08) (syst.)(-0.08)(+0.09) (norm)) x 10(-4). The J/psi decay is found to be dominated by an intermediate rho(770) state, whereas the psi' decay is dominated by di-pion masses around 2.2 GeV/c(2), leading to strikingly different Dalitz distributions.

We show that one should choose the masses of a bino-like, a wino-like and a Higgsino-like state as inputs in order to avoid large corrections to the masses of the other eigenstates in this sector. We also show that schemes where the Higgsino-like input state is a neutralino are more stable than those where the mass of the Higgsino-like chargino is used as input. The most stable scheme uses the masses of the wino-like chargino as well as the masses of the bino- and Higgsino-like neutralinos as inputs.

Herein we find out two representative aliphatic amines: linear propanediamine (PDA) and branched N,N,N',N'-tetra(3-aminopropyl)-1,3-propanediamine (TAPA), and use them to cure diglycidyl ether of bisphenol A (DGEBA). The curing reaction, dynamic mechanical properties, and thermal stability of DGEBA/PDA and DGEBA/TAPA are systematically investigated and compared. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirms TAPA and PDA have very close reactivity much higher than that of commercial Jeffamine T-403 with the branched molecular structure. The curing kinetic analysis shows TAPA causes the higher isothermal conversion at the lower temperature (e.g., 40 degrees C), the autocatalysis and diffusion-associated kinetics feature the isothermal reactions, and the extended Kamal model turns out to be able to well predict the curing rate. Then, the isoconversional analysis with the Vyazovkin methods demonstrates compared to PDA, TAPA leads to the lower effective activation energy at the very beginning due to its catalytic tertiary amino groups, but the reversed trend emerges in the deep-conversion stage, especially, in the glass-transition regime, owing to its flexible aliphatic molecular chains. Furthermore, the isothermal conversion at the higher temperatures is predicted from the nonisothermal experiments. Finally, dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) shows cured DGEBA/TAPA exhibits the higher glass- and beta-relaxation temperatures and crosslink density than DGEBA/PDA, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) reveals TAPA-cured epoxy has the excellent thermal stability with the higher char yield.

J	Zhang, HF; Shi, DM; Liu, RR; Wang, BH				Zhang, Haifeng; Shi, Dongmei; Liu, Runran; Wang, Binghong			Dynamic allocation of investments promotes cooperation in spatial public goods game	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Public goods game; Dynamic allocation mechanism; Cooperation level	EVOLUTIONARY PRISONERS-DILEMMA; SCALE-FREE NETWORKS; SOCIAL DILEMMAS; NOISE	In this paper, we introduce a dynamic allocation investment mechanism into the spatial public goods game. In the model, if a cooperator i collects more payoffs from one group centered on the player j in the last round, he will put more investments to the group in the next round. The intensity of investment is controlled by a tunable parameter a.

Silole-containing diyne and halogenated tetraphenylethene derivatives are synthesized and their coupling reactions furnish poly(arylene ethynylene)s with high molecular weights in high yields. All of the polymers are soluble and film-forming and possess a high thermal stability. They emit strong green lights when their solutions and nanoparticle suspensions are photoexcited. The polymers show high refractive indices with low chromatic dispersions. Their RI values can be modulated and their thin films can be crosslinked using UV irradiation, generating negative photoresist patterns.	[Jim, Cathy K. W.; Lam, Jacky W.

Therefore, we dissect the phenotypically heterogeneous CD4(+)FoxP3(+) T cells into subpopulations during the dynamic SLE development. Methodlogy/Principal Findings: To evaluate the proliferative and suppressive capacities of different CD4(+) T cell subgroups between active SLE patients and healthy donors, we employed CD45RA and CD25 as surface markers and carboxyfluorescein diacetatesuccinimidyl ester (CFSE) dilution assay. In addition, multiplex cytokines expression in active SLE patients was assessed using Luminex assay. Here, we showed a significant increase in the frequency of CD45RA(+)FoxP3(low) naive Treg cells (nTreg cells) and CD45RA(-)2 FoxP3(low) (non-Treg) cells in patients with active SLE. In active SLE patients, the increased proportions of wCD45RA(+)FoxP3(low) nTreg cells were positively correlated with the disease based on SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and the status of serum anti-dsDNA antibodies. We found that the surface marker combination of CD25(+)CD45RA(+) can be used to defined CD45RA(+)FoxP3(low) nTreg cells for functional assays, wherein nTreg cells from active SLE patients demonstrated defective suppression function. A significant correlation was observed between inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-12 and TNF alpha, and the frequency of nTreg cells. Furthermore, the CD45RA(+)FoxP3(low) nTreg cell subset increased when cultured with SLE serum compared to healthy donor serum, suggesting that the elevated inflammatory cytokines of SLE serum may promote nTreg cell proliferation/expansion. Conclusions/Significance: Our results indicate that impaired numbers of functional CD45RA(+)FoxP3(low) naive Treg cell and CD45RA(-)2 FoxP3(low) non-suppressive T cell subsets in inflammatory conditions may contribute to SLE development. Therefore, analysis of subsets of FoxP3(+) T cells, using a combination of FoxP3, CD25 and CD45RA, rather than whole FoxP3(+) T cells, will help us to better understand the pathogenesis of SLE and may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies.

Such novels by Hersey, Hayes, Burns, etc., focus on the occupied Italy during WWII, and attempt to reveal how Americans were degraded from liberators to conquerors in their oppression and extortion of the war ridden Italian people. This, in the minds of the above authors, can be traced back to materialism and Americanism, and is no different from the fascism the Americans fought during the war. The fierce criticism expressed by the novels of occupation not only announces the failure of Americanism abroad, but also manifests a strong critical awareness.

J	Yang, CP				Yang, Chui-Ping			Fast Quantum Gate with Superconducting Flux Qubits Coupled to a Cavity	PROGRESS OF THEORETICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							PROCESS TOMOGRAPHY; PHASE QUBITS; LOGIC GATES; ENTANGLEMENT; CIRCUIT; BITS	We present a way for fast implementation of a two-qubit controlled phase gate with superconducting flux qubits coupled to a cavity. A distinct feature of this proposal is that since only qubit-cavity resonant interaction and cubit-pulse resonant interaction are used, the gate can be performed much faster when compared with the previous proposals. This proposal does not require adjustment of the qubit level spacings during the gate operation. In addition, neither uniformity in the qubit parameters nor exact placement of qubits in the cavity is needed by this proposal.

We addressed this issue by examining whether the spatial pattern of neural representations for certain stimulus categories in these regions would change under different attention conditions. Faces. Chinese characters, and textures were presented in a block design fMRI experiment where participants in different runs attended to the stimuli under different conditions of attention. After localizing regions of interest (ROIs) in FFA and VWFA using general linear models, we performed spatial pattern analyses to examine both within- and cross-condition classification in these ROIs. The within-condition results replicated previous findings showing significant classification accuracy reduction when there was less attention compared with more attention. Critically, cross-condition classification in both FFA and VWFA revealed significantly above-chance accuracy for all stimulus categories, suggesting similar spatial neural representations across different attention conditions. Further strengthening this conclusion, when the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of the signals was adjusted to increase signal strength, cross-condition classification accuracy for faces in FFA and for Chinese characters in VWFA improved significantly, even approaching within-condition accuracy. This indicates that attention does not modulate the spatial pattern of neural representations involved in category selectivity, but only changes the signal strength relative to the noise level.

In the present study, different sucrose concentrations were applied to the culture medium to investigate the effects of sucrose on the development of excised flower buds and the regeneration of floral buds from sepals in wild-type and 35S::CFL gloxinia lines. The results showed that floral buds were formed directly from sepal explants without prior formation of shoots and leaves in 35S::CFL gloxinia lines when 2% w/v sucrose was added. Conversely, 0% or 5% w/v sucrose inhibited the generation of flower buds from sepals and the opening of flowers. Semi-quantitative PCR also showed that a medium with 5% w/v sucrose significantly inhibited MADS-box gene expression in wild type and much less significantly in 35S::CFL gloxinia. These data indicate that sucrose, as the main carbohydrate transported in floral organs, is a significant promoter of flower induction and maturity.

Given the column weight, we determine the shift values of the circulant permutation matrices via arithmetic analysis. The proposed constructions of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes achieve the following main advantages simultaneously: 1) our methods are constructive in the sense that we avoid any searching process; 2) our methods ensure no four or six cycles in the bipartite graphs corresponding to the LDPC codes; 3) our methods are direct constructions of quasi-cyclic LDPC codes which do not use any other quasi-cyclic LDPC codes of small length like component codes or any other algorithms/cyclic codes like building block; 4) the computations of the parameters involved are based on elementary number theory, thus very simple and fast. Simulation results show that the constructed regular codes of high rates perform almost 1.25 dB above Shannon limit and have no error floor down to the bit-error rate of 10(-6).

However, it is difficult to conduct effectively because of the great length of digital books. To do the correct clustering for digital books, a novel method based on probabilistic topic model is proposed. Firstly, we build a topic model named LDAC. The main goal of LDAC topic modeling is to effectively extract topics from digital books. Subsequently, Gibbs sampling is applied for parameter inference. Once the model parameters are learned, each book is assigned to the cluster which maximizes the posterior probability. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach based on LDAC is able to achieve significant improvement as compared to the related methods.

The effects of gestational hypoxia on maternal behavior have not been studied. In the present study, we investigated the effects of gestational hypoxia exposure on dam's maternal behavior, offspring's growth and plasma corticosterone levels after parturition in rats. Altitude hypoxia (3 and 5 km) was simulated in the hypobaric chambers during the last week of pregnancy and the effects were compared to those found in controls exposed at sea level. We found that gestational hypoxia significantly decreased dam's arched-back nursing activity across the lactation period. The effect was more profound in 5 km group. Gestational hypoxia also altered other maternal behaviors such as blanket and passive nursing. Hypoxia exposure was associated with abnormal birth weight and postnatal growth in pups, with a significantly higher and lower birth weight than control found in 3 and 5 km groups, respectively, and accelerated growth in both stressed groups. Gestational hypoxia exposure significantly elevated plasma corticosterone levels in dams at the time of weaning and in pups across the measurement days. Taken together, the present results indicate that hypoxia, particularly severe hypoxia during the late phase of pregnancy has a significantly adverse impact on animal's behavior, endocrine function and offspring development The higher birth weight found in the offspring of 3 km group suggests a compensatory system counteracting with the inhibitory effects of hypoxia on fetus growth at this altitude.

An F-1 family derived from the controlled interspecific hybridization between Dendrobium moniliforme and D. officinale were used to create genetic linkage maps of parental Dendrobiums using double pseudo-testcross strategy. A total of 422 markers, including 66 EST-SSR, 126 SRAP, 74 ISSR, and 156 RAPD markers, showed expected Mendelian segregation ratio and were used for genetic map construction. Genetic linkage groups with Kosambi genetic distances were constructed using a LOD score >= 4 and a recombination threshold of 0.4. The map of D. moniliforme was 1127.9 cM in total length with 165 marker loci distributed in 17 linkage groups: and the D. officinale map consisted of 19 genetic linkage groups with a total length of 1210.9 cM positioned by 169 marker loci. The genetic maps constructed in this study can serve as a reference linkage map of Dendrobium species for efficient studies of comparative genetics, genetic mapping of traits with economic interest, and marker-assisted selection in horticultural breeding.

Methods: Growth of 411 cells was assessed using MTT assay. Apoptosis and cell cycle of 411 cells were evaluated with flow cytometry, and the related proteins were examined using Western blotting. Real-time quantitative PCR was applied to detect the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). A highly malignant, spontaneously metastasizing 411 mouse mammary carcinoma model was used to evaluate the in vivo antitumor activity. Piperine was injected into tumors every 3 d for 3 times. Results: Piperine (35-280 pmol/L) inhibited the growth of 411 cells in time-and dose-dependent manners (the IC50 values were 105 1.08 and 78.52 1.06 pmol/L, respectively, at 48 and 72 h). Treatment of 411 cells with piperine (70-280 pmol/L) dose-dependently induced apoptosis of 411 cells, accompanying activation of caspase 3. The cells treated with piperine (140 and 280 pmol/L) significantly increased the percentage of cells in G2/M phase with a reduction in the expression of cyclin 81. Piperine (140 and 280 pmol/L) significantly decreased the expression of MMP-9 and MMP-13, and inhibited 411 cell migration in vitro. Injection of piperine (2.5 and 5 mg/kg) dose-dependently suppressed the primary 4T1 tumor growth and injection of piperine (5 mg/kg) significantly inhibited the lung metastasis. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that piperine is an effective antitumor compound in vitro and in vivo, and has the potential to be developed as a new anticancer drug.

Suppression of miRNA formation disrupts the initial generation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells from the ventricular neuroprogenitor cells in the embryonic spinal cord. miRNAs also regulate the later events of oligodendrocyte development, including cell proliferation, maturation, and myelin formation. In addition, miRNAs are essential for the development of astrocytes, and inhibition of miRNA genesis completely blocks astrogliogenesis in the spinal cord.

In this study, we analyzed the expression, activity, and immunoprotective potential of E. tarda heat shock protein DnaK. We found that dnaK expression was upregulated under conditions of heat shock, oxidative stress, and infection of host cells. Recombinant DnaK (rDnaK) purified from Escherichia coli exhibited ATPase activity and induced protection in Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) against lethal E. tarda challenge. On the basis of these results and our previous observation that a protective S. iniae antigen Sia10 which, when expressed heterogeneously in E. coli DH5 alpha, is secreted into the extracellular milieu, we constructed a chimeric antigen by fusing DnaK to Sia10. The resulting fusion protein Sia10-DnaK was expressed in DH5 alpha via the plasmid pTDK. Western blot analysis indicated that Sia10-DnaK was detected in the culture supernatant of DH5 alpha/pTDK. When flounder were vaccinated with live DH5 alpha/pTDK, strong protection was observed against both E. tarda and S. iniae. ELISA analysis detected specific serum antibody production in fish vaccinated with rDnaK and DH5 alpha/pTDK. Taken together, these results indicate that rDnaK is an intrinsic ATPase with immunoprotective property and that Sia10-DnaK delivered by a live bacterial host is an effective bivalent vaccine candidate against E. tarda and S. iniae infection.

Short-Term Fluctuations of Sugar Beet Damping-Off by Pythium ultimum in Relation to Changes in Bacterial Communities After Organic Amendments to Two Soils	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							GRADIENT GEL-ELECTROPHORESIS; MICROBIAL ACTIVITY; FERTILITY AMENDMENTS; RHIZOCTONIA-SOLANI; POPULATIONS; DISEASE; SUPPRESSIVENESS; DIVERSITY; COMPOST; ROOT	Previously, oscillations in beet seedling damping-off by Pythium ultimum, measured as area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), were demonstrated after incorporation of organic materials into organic and conventional soils. These periodic fluctuations of P. ultimum infections were cross-correlated with oscillations of copiotrophic CFU at lags of 2 to 4 days. For this article, we investigated whether bacterial communities and microbial activities fluctuated after a disturbance from incorporation of organic materials, and whether these fluctuations were linked to the short-term oscillations in AUDPC of beet seedling damping-off and bacterial populations (CFU) in soil. Soil microbial communities studied by polymerase chain reaction-DGGE analysis of 16S DNA after isolation of total DNA from soil and microbial activities measured as CO2 emission rates were monitored daily for 14 days after addition of grass-clover (GC) or composted manure (CM) into organic versus conventional soils. Similar to our previous findings, AUDPC and density of copiotrophic bacteria oscillated with time. Fluctuations in species richness (S), Shannon diversity index (H), and individual amplicons on DGGE gels were also detected. Oscillations in AUDPC were positively cross-correlated with copiotrophic CFU in all soils. Oscillations in AUDPC were also positively cross-correlated with 19 to 35% of the high-intensity DNA fragments in soils amended with GC but only 2 to 3% of these fragments in CM-amended soils. AUDPC values were negatively cross-correlated with 13 to 17% of the amplicons with low average intensities in CM-amended soils, which were not correlated with densities of copiotrophic CFU. CO2 emission rates had remarkable variations in the initial 7 days after either of the soil amendments but were not associated with daily changes in AUDPC. The results suggest that infection by P. ultimum is hampered by competition from culturable copiotrophic bacteria and some high-intensity DGGE amplicons, because AUDPC is cross-correlated with these variables at lags of 1 to 4 days. However, negative cross-correlations with low-intensity DNA fragments indicate that P. ultimum infection could also be suppressed by antagonistic bacteria with low densities that may be nonculturable species, especially in CM amended soil. The organic soil generally had lower AUDPC values, higher bacterial diversity, and negative cross-correlations between AUDPC and low-intensity DNA fragments (after CM amendment), indicating that specific bacteria that do not attain high densities may contribute to P. ultimum suppression in organic soils.

These supported catalysts were then tested for their efficiency in the hydrosilylation of alkenes. The factors affecting their catalytic properties, e.g. relative molecular mass of polyethylene glycol, reaction temperature, platinum content, and type of alkenes, have been studied. It was found that the activity of the platinum catalyst decreased with increasing length of the polyethylene glycol chain, and increased with reaction temperature. Moreover, these catalysts could be reused several times without a noticeable decrease in activity or selectivity. The reaction pathway leading to excellent selectivity for the beta-adduct of hydrosilylation of alkenes with triethoxysilane catalyzed by this catalysis system was discussed.

However, the depth data captured by Kinect over a certain distance is of extreme low quality. In this paper, we present a novel scanning system for capturing 3D full human body models by using multiple Kinects. To avoid the interference phenomena, we use two Kinects to capture the upper part and lower part of a human body respectively without overlapping region. A third Kinect is used to capture the middle part of the human body from the opposite direction. We propose a practical approach for registering the various body parts of different views under non-rigid deformation. First, a rough mesh template is constructed and used to deform successive frames pairwisely. Second, global alignment is performed to distribute errors in the deformation space, which can solve the loop closure problem efficiently. Misalignment caused by complex occlusion can also be handled reasonably by our global alignment algorithm. The experimental results have shown the efficiency and applicability of our system. Our system obtains impressive results in a few minutes with low price devices, thus is practically useful for generating personalized avatars for everyday users. Our system has been used for 3D human animation and virtual try on, and can further facilitate a range of home-oriented virtual reality (VR) applications.

Plant-specific trihelix transcription factor AtGT2L interacts with calcium/calmodulin and responds to cold and salt stresses	PLANT SCIENCE			English	Article						Calmodulin; GT factors; Cold; Salinity; RD29A; ERD10	RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE; DNA-BINDING PROTEIN; SIGNALING PATHWAYS; INDUCED EXPRESSION; RBCS-3A GENE; ARABIDOPSIS; CALMODULIN; TOLERANCE; FAMILY; BOX	GT factors are a family of plant-specific transcription factors with conserved trihelix DNA-binding domains that bind GT elements. By screening a cDNA expression library with S-35-labeled recombinant calmodulin (CaM), we identified AtGT2L, a classic member of GT-2 subfamily, as a Ca2+-dependent CaM-binding protein. AtGT2L specifically targets the nucleus and possesses both transcriptional activation and DNA-binding abilities, implicating its function as a nuclear transcription factor. The CaM-binding domain (CaMBD) of AtGT2L is embedded in its C-terminal DNA-binding domain, but the in vitro DNA-binding ability of AtGT2L was not affected by its interaction with CaM. Site-directed mutagenesis experiments further revealed that Met(506) and Leu(507) in the CaMBD are critical for both CaM- and DNA-binding abilities of AtGT2L. Northern blot analysis showed that AtGT2L mRNA levels are higher in old rosette leaves, cauline leaves and flowers than in other organs. In addition, the expression of AtGT2L was responsive to cold, NaCl and abscisic acid treatments. Furthermore, both basal and chilling/NaCl-induced expressions of the cold- and salt-inducible marker genes RD29A and ERD10 were higher in plants overexpressing AtGT2L than those in wild-type plants. Thus, our data indicate that AtGT2L is a Ca2+/CaM-binding nuclear transcription factor involved in plant responses to cold and salt stresses. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Zhang, W; Zhang, HY; Zhang, YF				Zhang Wei; Zhang Hongye; Zhang Yifeng			A method to determine the spatial allocation standard of social ecological compensation	JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						social ecological compensation; geographical endowments; spatial allocation; payments; social justice; China	ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES HELP; LATIN-AMERICA; PAYMENTS; ISSUES	Ecological compensation is a hot subject in academic studies, and the determination of the spatial allocation of compensation payments is a key point in the research of ecological compensation. There are two kinds of thoughts in the determination of regional spatial allocation at present: "evaluation of ecological construction cost" and "evaluation of ecosystem services value". This paper analyzes the relationships between social ecological compensation and regional socio-economic development, and establishes two econometric models with the data of 2007 from various provinces in China. Through these models, the impacts of geographical endowments on the regional socio-economic development in various provinces are analyzed from the social justice viewpoint and the concept of "equivalent value of geographical endowments" (EGE for short) is proposed. This paper analyzes the application prospect of EGE in the policy making of regional ecological compensation. The results showed that: (1) the implementation of social ecological compensation is not only an effective guarantee for each region to obtain the equal rights of survival, development and decent environment, but also an essential assurance to the coordinated, balanced and sustainable development among various regions; (2) the regional difference in geographical endowments is an important factor affecting the regional spatial variation of socio-economic development. Therefore, geographical endowments are important bases for the determination of the spatial allocation of compensation payments in social ecological compensation; (3) based on the EGE, the government can determine the spatial allocation of social ecological compensation scientifically, and avoid the "sweeping approach" phenomenon in the policy making process of ecological compensation.

During spermatogenesis, KIF3A plays a critical role in the formation of flagella and cilia. KIF3A is also related to the left-right asymmetry, the signal pathway, DNA damage and tumorigenesis. We used RT-PCR and in situ hybridization to clone the kif3a gene, and we identified its function in the testis of the Chinese fire-bellied newt Cynops orientalis (termed as co-kif3a). The full-length sequence of co-kif3a was 2193 bp, containing a 56 bp 5'UTR, 2073 bp ORF encoding a protein of 691 amino acids and a 64 bp 3'UTR. The secondary structure analysis showed that co-KIF3A had three motor domains, representing the N-terminal motor domain (1-400 aa), alpha-helix domain (400-600 aa) and C-terminal tail domain (600-691 aa). The amino acid sequence of co-KIF3A shared an identity of 55.9%, 90.9%, 89.9%, 91.3% and 85.7% with its counterparts in Aedes aegypti, Mus musculus, Xenopus tropicalis, Homo sapiens and Danio rerio, respectively. The calculated molecular weight of the putative co-KIF3A was 79 kDa and its estimated isoelectric point was 6.8. RT-PCR result showed that co-kif3a was expressed in several examined tissues, with a high level in the testis and low levels in liver, muscle and ovum. Kif3a was weakly expressed in the heart and spleen, and barely detected in the intestine. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that in early spermatid co-kif3a was expressed around the nuclear membrane. When the tail began to emerge in the middle spermatid, mRNA transcript was abundantly concentrated in the flagellum. The mRNA signal was still very strong along all the flagellum in late spermatid. In mature spermatid, the message was weak. Therefore, co-KIF3A probably plays a functional role in the spermiogenesis of C. orientalis.

The circular-hole defect obtained from the outdiffusion of the hydrogen in the annealing process can induce strong resonant scattering loss at some special wavelengths. The positions of resonant peaks will linearly shift with the refractive index change of the detected sample (the sensitivity is similar to 9200 nm/RIU). In addition, the influences of the defect on the sensing characteristics are numerically analyzed based on a scalar diffraction method and a Green tensor technology.	[Song, J.; Li, Y.

Lindane with an initial concentration of 0.2 mg L-1 in the cultures had no negative effect on the chlorophyll a concentration of A. azotica after 5 d exposure. The tolerance of this cyanobacterium to lindane indicates that it has the potential to biodegrade lindane. The degradation experiments show that the percentage of lindane removal efficiency by A. azotica was 48.8% after 5 d, at an initial lindane concentration of 0.2 mg L-1 and initial A. azotica chlorophyll a concentration of 50 mg L-1. The calculated half-life was 4.78 d. Elevated culture temperature, irradiation, and usage of nitrate as the nitrogen source in the cultures could increase the biodegradation efficiency of lindane. gamma-Pentachlorocyclohexene was detected as a metabolite of lindane. The ability of A. azotica to biodegrade lindane has potential use in the bioremediation for this organochlorine pesticide.

J	Zhou, YB; Lu, LY; Li, MH				Zhou, Yan-Bo; Lu, Linyuan; Li, Menghui			Quantifying the influence of scientists and their publications: distinguishing between prestige and popularity	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							IMPACT FACTOR; PAGERANK; RANKING; CITATIONS; NETWORKS; JOURNALS; INDEX	The number of citations is a widely used metric for evaluating the scientific credit of papers, scientists and journals. However, it so happens that papers with fewer citations from prestigious scientists have a higher influence than papers with more citations. In this paper, we argue that by whom the paper is being cited is of greater significance than merely the number of citations. Accordingly, we propose an interactive model of author-paper bipartite networks as well as an iterative algorithm to obtain better rankings for scientists and their publications. The main advantage of this method is twofold: (i) it is a parameter-free algorithm; (ii) it considers the relationship between the prestige of scientists and the quality of their publications. We conducted real experiments on publications in econophysics, and used this method to evaluate the influence of related scientific journals. The comparison between the rankings by our method and simple citation counts suggests that our method is effective in distinguishing prestige from popularity.

The presence of bulky substituents on silicon is essential to facilitate the overall cyclopolymerization process in 3. Simple methacrylate derivatives do not undergo polymerization under these conditions. This observation can be understood within the framework of the Thorpe-Ingold effect in organosilicon chemistry. The high rr stereoselectivity suggests that the cyclization step may selectively lead to the r diastereomer. Density functional theory calculations also show that r selectivity might be slightly favored.

BESIII Collaboration	Spin-Parity Analysis of p(p)over-bar Mass Threshold Structure in J/psi and psi(3686) Radiative Decays	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							ENHANCEMENT; STATE	A partial wave analysis of the p (p) over bar mass-threshold enhancement in the reaction J/psi -> gamma p (p) over bar is used to determine its J(PC) quantum numbers to be 0(-+), its peak mass to be below threshold at M 1832(-5)(+19)(stat)(-17)(+18)(syst) +/- 19(model) MeV/c(2), and its total width to be Gamma < 76 MeV/c(2) at the 90% C. L. The product of branching ratios is measured to be BR[J/psi -> gamma X(p<(p)over bar>)]BR[X(p (p) over bar) -> p (p) over bar] = [9:0(-1.1)(+0.4)(stat)(-5.0)(+1:5)(syst) +/- 2: 3(model)] x 10(-5). A similar analysis performed on psi(3686) -> gamma p (p) over bar decays shows, for the first time, the presence of a corresponding enhancement with a production rate relative to that for J/psi decays of R = [5.08(-0.45)(+0: 71)(stat)(-058)(+0: 67) (syst) +/- 0: 12(model)%.

J	Wang, YL; Ding, Y; Ni, J				Wang, Yanli; Ding, Yi; Ni, Jun			Stereo Boron Nitride Nanoribbons with Junction-Dependent Electronic Structures from First-Principles	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							NANOTUBES; CARBON; BN	Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structures and properties of stereo triwing boron nitride nanoribbons (TBNNRs). These triwing structures are constructed by three BN ribbon wings connected via the junctions, which have comparable thermodynamic stabilities to the planar nanoribbons. We find that the junctions play a primary role in the electronic structures of triwing nanoribbons, which cause versatile electronic and magnetic properties for the stereo structures. For the armchair edges, all the TBNNRs are semiconductors, for which the wide band gaps are opened between the occupied N p(z) orbitals and unoccupied B p(z) orbitals adjacent to the junctions, while for the zigzag ones, the TBNNRs can be metals or narrow-band gap semiconductors depending on the bonding characteristics of the junctions. The sp(2)-bonding junctions substantially reduce the band gaps, and the sp(3)-bonding junctions even induce the metallic behaviors. Moreover, due to the Stoner effect, an intrinsic spin-polarized phenomenon occurs when the sp(3)-bonding junction contains only the boron atoms. Accompanied by the spin-polarization, a metal-to-semiconductor transition takes place in these zigzag TBNNRs, which become semiconducting sp-electron ferromagnets. Our studies demonstrate that the electronic structures of triwing BN nanoribbons can be effectively tailored by the junctions, which leads to potential applications in the nanoscale electronics and spintronics.

It is different from light wave scattered by an isotropic particle that the frequency shifts of spectral lines will be induced by the rotation of the anisotropic particle. The analytical expression for the spectrum of the scattered field is derived and numerical examples are also illustrated.

We establish the global existence of an energy-conservative weak solution to its Cauchy problem for initial data of finite energy.

Many experiments show a possible mesoscopic phase separation of the superconductivity and antiferromagnetism, while a neutron experiment reveals a sizable suppression of magnetic moment due to the superconductivity, indicating a possible phase coexistence. Here we propose that the observed suppression of the magnetic moment may be explained by the proximity effect within a phase-separation scenario. We use a two-orbital model to study the proximity effect on a layer of the block AFM state induced by neighboring SC layers via an interlayer tunneling mechanism. We argue that the proximity effect in ternary Fe selenides should be large because of the large interlayer coupling and weak electron correlation. The result of our mean-field theory is compared with the neutron experiments semiquantitatively. The suppression of the magnetic moment due to the SC proximity effect is found to be more pronounced in d-wave superconductivity and may be enhanced by the frustrated structure of the block AFM state.

A structure- and expression-based re-examination in plants	RNA BIOLOGY			English	Article							ANNOTATION; MIRNA	In this survey, we did a large-scale re-examination of the currently registered plant microRNAs (miRNAs) in miRBase (release 17), which were annotated based on the already established criteria. Huge public small RNA (sRNA) high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data sets were employed to interrogate the accuracy of the miRBase registries based on the secondary structures of the miRNA precursors and the expression levels of the miRNAs and the miRNA*s. Our results raised the caveat that the current miRNA lists in miRBase should be carefully refined, and more strict criteria should be implemented for new miRNA registration. Through this work, we proposed a structure- and expression-based strategy to validate a set of defined miRNA genes, or even to annotate novel ones based on currently available sRNA HTS data sets. We also hope to inspire further research efforts on the manual refinement of the current miRNA gene lists.

Materials and methods Protozoan samples were monthly collected at six sampling stations with a spatial gradient of environmental status. Physicochemical parameters, e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen, chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand, total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorus (TP), were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. Results The protozoan community structures represented significant differences among the six sampling stations. The spatial patterns of protozoan communities were significantly correlated with the changes of chemical variables, especially COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN. Of 88 protozoan taxa recorded over the study period, ten species (e.g., Carchesium polypinum, Colpidium campylum, Prorodon teres, Vorticella putrina, Zoothamnium arbuscula, Euglena spp., and Phacus spp.) were significantly related to COD, either alone or in combination with TP and/or TN. Conclusion These findings suggest that protozoa can be used as a robust bioindicator of water quality in freshwater river systems.

Excitation energy transfer and trapping dynamics in the core complex of the filamentous photosynthetic bacterium Roseiflexus castenholzii	PHOTOSYNTHESIS RESEARCH			English	Article						Excitation energy transfer; Trapping; Core complex; Ultrafast spectroscopy; Filamentous anoxygenic photosynthetic bacterium; Roseiflexus castenholzii	LIGHT-HARVESTING COMPLEX; CHLOROFLEXUS-AURANTIACUS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; RHODOSPIRILLUM-MOLISCHIANUM; RHODOBACTER-SPHAEROIDES; CHARGE SEPARATION; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; PURPLE BACTERIA; ANTENNA; PROTEIN	The light-harvesting core complex of the thermophilic filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic bacterium Roseiflexus castenholzii is intrinsic to the cytoplasmic membrane and intimately bound to the reaction center (RC). Using ultrafast transient absorption and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy with selective excitation, energy transfer, and trapping dynamics in the core complex have been investigated at room temperature in both open and closed RCs. Results presented in this report revealed that the excited energy transfer from the BChl 800 to the BChl 880 band of the antenna takes about 2 ps independent of the trapping by the RC. The time constants for excitation quenching in the core antenna BChl 880 by open and closed RCs were found to be 60 and 210 ps, respectively. Assuming that the light harvesting complex is generally similar to LH1 of purple bacteria, the possible structural and functional aspects of this unique antenna complex are discussed. The results show that the core complex of Roseiflexus castenholzii contains characteristics of both purple bacteria and Chloroflexus aurantiacus.

The formed hydroxymethylation product could further react with a nucleophile, which allowed us to develop some one-pot, stepwise, three-component reactions of beta-ketosulfones and formaldehyde in this binary mixture. Particularly, a one-pot, two-step, sequential four-component reaction of a-bromo ketone, sodium benzenesulfinate, thiophenol and formaldehyde was also developed. These results not only demonstrate that it is possible to develop a new bio-based system by mixing two or more bio-based chemicals together, but also confer us a convenient means for controlling the selectivity of some multicomponent reactions of formaldehyde. Because GAAS and meglumine are both highly hydrophilic, the mixed solvent system could thus be recovered after extraction of organic products. In a three-component reaction of beta-ketosulfone, paraformaldehyde and a-methylstyrene, the GAAS/meglumine system could be reused at least four times without significant loss of activity.

AtHsp90.3 supported the Saccharomyces cerevisiae Hsp90 knockout strain R0005 growth and maintaining cells membrane integrity under cadmium and arsenic stresses, which was compatible with the components of ScHsc82 machinery. However, constitutive overexpression of AtHsp90.3 in Arabidopsis impaired plant tolerance to Cd stress with lower germination rate and shorter root length, decreased contents of phytochelatins (PCs) and glutathione (GSH), inhibited activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and peroxidase (POD), and increased content of malondialdehyde (MDA). These results suggested that proper homeostasis of Hsp90 was critical for cellular response and/or tolerance to heavy metal stress in plants.	[Song, H. M.; Wang, H. Z.; Xu, X.

To further expand our knowledge about the DNA damage response (DDR) induced by BaP, we investigated the nuclear protein expression profiles in HeLa cells treated with different concentrations of BaP (0.1, 1, and 10 mu M) using this proteomics-based 2-D gel electrophoresis assay. We found 125 differentially expressed proteins in BaP-treated cells compared to control cells. Among them, 79 (63.2%) were down-regulated, 46 (36.8%) were up-regulated; 8 showed changes in the 1 mu M and 10 BaP-treated groups, 2 in the 0.1 mu M and 10 mu M BaP-treated groups, 4 in the 0.1 mu M and 1 BaP-treated groups, and only one showed changes in all three groups. Fifty protein spots were chosen for liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) identification, and of these, 39 were identified, including subunits of the 26S proteasome and Annexin A1. The functions of some identified proteins were further examined and the results showed that they might be involved in BaP-induced DDR. Taken together, these data indicate that proteomics is a valuable approach in the study of environmental chemical-host interactions, and the identified proteins could provide new leads for better understanding BaP-induced mutagenesis and carcinogenesis.

Field surveys conducted during October 17-26, 2009 showed a wide range of TSS concentration (3-524 mg/L). Atmospheric correction was implemented using the Fast Line-of-sight Atmospheric Analysis of Spectral Hypercubes (FLAASH) module in ENVI with the aid of aerosol information retrieved from concurrent Terra/Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) surveys, which worked well at the CCD bands with relatively high reflectance. A practical exponential retrieval algorithm was created between satellite remote sensing reflectance and in-situ measured TSS concentration. The retrieved results for the whole water area matched the in-situ data well at most stations. The retrieval errors may be related to the problem of scale matching and mixed pixel. In three selected subregions of Poyang Lake, the distribution trend of retrieved TSS was consistent with that of the field investigation. It was shown that HJ-1A/1B CCD imagery can be used to estimate TSS concentrations in Poyang Lake over synoptic scales after applying an appropriate atmospheric correction method and retrieval algorithm.

It is found that the islands are composed of quasi-circular granules with planar size around 50.0 nm, which is approximately independent of nominal thickness d. Our measurement indicates that the geometrical shape of the granules changes from plateau to sphere as d goes up. The dynamic scaling analysis reveal that the roughness exponent alpha varies between 0.80 and 0.90 as d increases. The average roughness w(rms) shows power-law relationship with d and the growth exponent beta = 0.53 +/- 0: 03 when d <= 4.0 nm. However, w(rms) deviates obviously from the power-law relationship for the samples with d > 4: 0 nm. This anomalous behavior of beta is explained by the competition between the shadowing and reemission processes, and then the kinetic evolution and formation mechanism of the islands are presented.

J	Wei, SL; Liu, XF; Wang, ZH; Wang, XQ				Wei, Silin; Liu, Xiufeng; Wang, Zuhao; Wang, Xingqiao			Using Rasch Measurement To Develop a Computer Modeling-Based Instrument To Assess Students' Conceptual Understanding of Matter	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION			English	Article						High School/Introductory Chemistry; Chemical Education Research; Computer-Based Learning; Testing/Assessment; Learning Theories	HIGH-SCHOOL; CHEMISTRY; ELEMENTARY; REPRESENTATIONS; PROGRESSION; MULTIMEDIA	Research suggests that difficulty in making connections among three levels of chemical representations- macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic-is a primary reason for student alternative conceptions of chemistry concepts, and computer modeling is promising to help students make the connections. However, no computer modeling-based assessment tools are currently available. This article introduces an approach to using Rasch measurement to develop a computer modeling-based instrument to assess students' conceptual understanding of matter. The instrument contained 15 multiple-choice and 3 constructed-response questions. Two pilot tests were carried out in high schools both in the United States and China. In pilot test I, the instrument was given to 112 students. The partial-credit Rasch model was applied to the data to examine item and test properties. The instrument was then revised and given to 403 students in pilot test II. The partial-credit Rasch model was applied again to the data, and noticeable improvements were achieved in technical qualities of both items and the instrument as a whole. This study demonstrates that using Rasch measurement to develop computer modeling-based measurement instruments in chemistry is promising.

Low temperature at 1 degrees C triggered a marked increase in endogenous NO levels in loquat fruit during postharvest storage. Pretreatment of fruit with the NO scavenger 2-(4-carboxyphenyl)-4,4,5,5-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide (cPTIO) not only abolished endogenous NO accumulation but also aggravated chilling injury symptoms in the fruit stored at 1 degrees C and 95% RH. Moreover, the cold-stored fruit in which NO accumulation is abolished by cPTIO exhibited significantly higher membrane permeability, lipid peroxidation, superoxide anion (O-2(center dot-)) production rates and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) contents than the control fruit. Furthermore, the results show that abolition of endogenous NO accumulation significantly reduced activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase (APX) and peroxidase (POD) in the fruit during cold storage. Together, our results suggest that cold-induced endogenous NO generation in loquat fruit during postharvest storage plays a critical role in alleviating chilling injury symptoms by affecting the antioxidative defense systems in the fruit.

EUPHYTICA			English	Article						Fine mapping; Flag leaf length; Quantitative trait locus; Residual heterozygote; Rice (Oryza sativa L.)	QTL ANALYSIS; GRAIN-YIELD; POPULATION; CHROMOSOME-6; DISSECTION; SINK	Fine mapping of a quantitative trait locus, qFLL6.2, controlling flag leaf length (FLL) and yield traits in rice was conducted using four sets of near isogenic lines (NILs) that were developed from a common residual heterozygote at F-7 generation of the indica rice cross Zhenshan 97/Milyang 46. Each of the NIL sets consisted of 40 lines that are S-1 progenies of ten maternal homozygotes, ten paternal homozygotes, and 20 heterozygotes differing in a portion of the 1.19-Mb interval RM3414-RM6917 on the short arm of rice chromosome 6. Analysis of phenotypic differences among the three genotypic groups in each NIL set delimited qFLL6.2 to a 62.1-kb region flanked by simple sequence repeat marker RM3414 and sequence-tagged site marker Si2944. This QTL explained 52.73% of the phenotypic variance, and the Zhenshan 97 allele increased FLL by 2.40 cm. Based on data collected from homozygous lines of three of the NIL sets, qFLL6.2 was shown to have major effects on all the three yield traits analyzed, including the number of spikelets per panicle, the number of filled grains per panicle, and grain weight per panicle. A comparison of the different groups revealed that the effect of qFLL6.2 was highly consistent across different genetic backgrounds and environments, providing a good candidate for map-based cloning and investigating the source-sink relationship in rice.

Total concentrations of PCBs ranged from 4.93 to 108.79 ng g(-1) dry weight for all sampling stations, with a substantial higher concentration in the inner part of the estuary than the outer part of the estuary. PCB patterns in sediments from sites 1-8 were extremely dominated by tetra-PCBs, which probably due to the discharge of local industrial plants but not the expected input from the nearby e-waste recycling areas. Principal component analysis revealed that the sources of PCBs for sites 9-23 were associated with Aroclor 1248 or Aroclor 1221. However, physical migration and bio-degradation may also play a role on PCB distribution. Hazard assessment of PCBs indicated possible toxic potential, particularly in areas close to point sources.

However, little is known about whether the local synchronization of spontaneous brain activity could predict response inhibition. In the current study, we used regional homogeneity (ReHo) to measure the local synchronization of RS-fMRI signals, and then investigated the relationship between ReHo and individual differences in response inhibition, as evaluated by the stop signal reaction time (SSRT) in a Stop signal task. The results showed that ReHo of RS-fMRI signals could successfully predict SSRT. Specifically, positive ReHo-SSRT correlations were observed in the bilateral inferior frontal cortex (IFC) and three critical components of the default mode network (DMN), and negative ReHo-SSRT correlations were observed in the rolandic area/posterior insula and the bilateral middle occipital cortex. The present results indicate the possible influence of the IFC and rolandic area/posterior insula on the efficiency of response inhibition, and demonstrate the importance of the DMN for the efficiency of cognitive task performance.

However, the intrinsic mechanisms regulating this process are not well understood. Principal Finding: This study has characterized the function of cyclin K, a regulatory subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb) in the two different developmental pathways of Artemia. In the diapause-destined embryo, Western blots showed that the cyclin K protein was down-regulated as the embryo entered dormancy and reverted to relatively high levels of expression once development resumed, consistent with the fluctuations in phosphorylation of position 2 serines (Ser2) in the C-terminal domain (CTD) of the largest subunit (Rpb1) of RNA polymerase II (RNAP II). Interestingly, the cyclin K transcript levels remained constant during this process. In vitro translation data indicated that the template activity of cyclin K mRNA stored in the postdiapause cyst was repressed. In addition, in vivo knockdown of cyclin K in developing embryos by RNA interference eliminated phosphorylation of the CTD Ser2 of RNAP II and induced apoptosis by inhibiting the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) survival signaling pathway. Conclusions/Significance: Taken together, these findings reveal a role for cyclin K in regulating RNAP II activity during diapause embryo development, which involves the post-transcriptional regulation of cyclin K. In addition, a further role was identified for cyclin K in regulating the control of cell survival during embryogenesis through ERK signaling pathways.

J	Hu, ZG; Liu, HY; Weng, XC; Northoff, G				Hu, Zhiguo; Liu, Hongyan; Weng, Xuchu; Northoff, Georg			Is There a Valence-Specific Pattern in Emotional Conflict in Major Depressive Disorder? An Exploratory Psychological Study	PLOS ONE			English	Article							SELECTIVE ATTENTION; FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; CONSTRUCT ACCESSIBILITY; CLINICAL DEPRESSION; ANXIETY; STIMULI; BIAS; ACTIVATION; MODEL	Objective: Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) clinically exhibit a deficit in positive emotional processing and are often distracted by especially negative emotional stimuli. Such emotional-cognitive interference in turn hampers the cognitive abilities of patients in their ongoing task. While the psychological correlates of such emotional conflict have been well identified in healthy subjects, possible alterations of emotional conflict in depressed patients remain to be investigated. We conducted an exploratory psychological study to investigate emotional conflict in MDD. We also distinguished depression-related stimuli from negative stimuli in order to check whether the depression-related distractors will induce enhanced conflict in MDD. Methods: A typical word-face Stroop paradigm was adopted. In order to account for valence-specificities in MDD, we included positive and general negative as well as depression-related words in the study. Results: MDD patients demonstrated a specific pattern of emotional conflict clearly distinguishable from the healthy control group. In MDD, the positive distractor words did not significantly interrupt the processing of the negative target faces, while they did in healthy subjects. On the other hand, the depression-related distractor words induced significant emotional conflict to the positive target faces in MDD patients but not in the healthy control group. Conclusion: Our findings demonstrated for the first time an altered valence-specific pattern in emotional conflict in MDD patients. The study sheds a novel and specific light on the affective mechanisms underlying the abnormal emotional-cognitive interference in MDD. Such emotional conflict bears important clinical relevance since it may trigger the widespread cognitive dysfunctions frequently observed in MDD. The present findings may have important clinical implications in both prediction and psychotherapy of MDD.

Most severe CAP patients are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), and receive intense treatment. The present study aimed to evaluate the role of the pneumonia severity index (PSI), CURB-65, and sepsis score in the management of hospitalized CAP patients and explore the effect of ICU treatment on prognosis of severe cases. Methods A total of 675 CAP patients hospitalized in the Second Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University School of Medicine were retrospectively investigated. The ability of different pneumonia severity scores to predict mortality was compared for effectiveness, while the risk factors associated with 30-day mortality rates and hospital length of stay (LOS) were evaluated. The effect of ICU treatment on the outcomes of severe CAP patients was also investigated. Results All three scoring systems revealed that the mortality associated with the low-risk or intermediate-risk group was significantly lower than with the high-risk group. As the risk level increased, the frequency of ICU admission rose in tandem and LOS in the hospital was prolonged. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the prediction of mortality were 0.94, 0.91 and 0.89 for the PSI, CURB-65 and sepsis score, respectively. Compared with the corresponding control groups, the mortality was markedly increased in patients with a history of smoking, prior admission to ICU, respiratory failure, or co-morbidity of heart disease. The differences were also identified in LOS between control groups and patients with ICU treatment, heart, or cerebrovascular disease. Logistic regression analysis showed that age over 65 years, a history of smoking, and respiratory failure were closely related to mortality in the overall CAP cohort, whereas age, ICU admission, respiratory failure, and LOS at home between disease attack and hospital admission were identified as independent risk factors for mortality in the high-risk CAP sub-group. The 30-day mortality of patients who underwent ICU treatment on admission was also higher than for non-ICU treatment, but much lower than for those patients who took ICU treatment subsequent to the failure of non-ICU treatment. Conclusions Each severity score system, CURB-65, sepsis severity score and especially PSI, was capable of effectively predicting CAP mortality. Delayed ICU admission was related to higher mortality rates in severe CAP patients.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Electronic structures of silicene fluoride and hydride	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							GRAPHENE	Silicene is the graphene-like silicon nanosheet, which has been synthesized very recently [B. Lalmi, H. Oughaddou, H. Enriquez, A. Kara, S. Vizzini, B. Ealet, and B. Aufray, Appl. Phys. Lett. 97, 223109 (2010)]. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the structures and properties of fluorinated and hydrogenated silicene, the silicon analogues of graphane. Different from the carbon-counterpart, the fluorination prefers the conformation with a zigzag-line buckling, while the hydrogenation keeps the chair conformation similar to graphane. A direct band gap is opened in the silicene fluoride, and the gap values can be continuously modulated by the strain. While for the hydride, a strain-induced indirect-to-direct band gap transition is found. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

J	Liu, RR; Wang, WX; Lai, YC; Wang, BH				Liu, Run-Ran; Wang, Wen-Xu; Lai, Ying-Cheng; Wang, Bing-Hong			Cascading dynamics on random networks: Crossover in phase transition	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							FAILURES	In a complex network, random initial attacks or failures can trigger subsequent failures in a cascading manner, which is effectively a phase transition. Recent works have demonstrated that in networks with interdependent links so that the failure of one node causes the immediate failures of all nodes connected to it by such links, both first-and second-order phase transitions can arise. Moreover, there is a crossover between the two types of transitions at a critical system-parameter value. We demonstrate that these phenomena can occur in the more general setting where no interdependent links are present. A heuristic theory is derived to estimate the crossover and phase-transition points, and a remarkable agreement with numerics is obtained.

Upper critical field and thermally activated flux flow in single-crystalline Tl0.58Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; CRITICAL MAGNETIC-FIELD; IRON PNICTIDES; DEPENDENCE; COEXISTENCE; ANISOTROPY; SPIN; CS	The upper critical field mu H-0(c2)(T-c) of Tl0.58Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2 single crystals has been determined by means of measuring the electrical resistivity in both a pulsed magnetic field (similar to 58 T) and a dc magnetic field (similar to 14 T). It is found that mu H-0(c2) linearly increases with decreasing temperature for H parallel to c, reaching mu H-0(c2)H parallel to c (0 K) similar or equal to 60 T. On the other hand, a larger mu H-0(c2)(0 K) with a strong convex curvature is observed for H perpendicular to c [mu H-0(c2)H perpendicular to c (18 K) similar or equal to 60 T]. This compound shows a moderate anisotropy of the upper critical field around T-c, which decreases with decreasing temperature. Analysis of the upper critical field based on the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) method indicates that mu H-0(c2)(0 K) is orbitally limited for H parallel to c, but the effect of spin paramagnetismmay play an important role in the pair breaking for H perpendicular to c. All these experimental observations remarkably resemble those of the iron pnictide superconductors, suggesting a universal scenario for the iron-based superconductors. Moreover, the superconducting transition is broadened significantly upon applying a magnetic field, indicating strong thermal fluctuation effects in the superconducting state of Tl0.58Rb0.42Fe1.72Se2. The derived thermal activation energy for vortex motion is compatible with those of the 1111-type iron pnictides.	[Jiao, L.; Zhang, J. L.; Wang, H. D.; Chen, Y.; Wang, L. N.; Shang, T.; Fang, M.

In this paper, a new model is proposed to assist E-Commerce practitioners in the assessment of E-Commerce security. The proposed model is based on Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory of evidence. First, according to the characteristics of E-Commerce, a hierarchical structure of E-Commerce security is established to calculate the weights of relevant issues using AHP. Then Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence is applied to combine all the issues, regarded as evidences, in order to derive a consensus decision for the degree of E-Commerce security. An illustrative example is given to show the efficiency of our model. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This material demonstrates high reversible capacity, excellent cycling performance, and good rate capacity as an anode electrode material for Li ion batteries. The significant enhancement in the electrochemical Li storage performance in ultrafine MoO2 nanorods is attributed to the nanorod structure with small diameter and efficient one-dimensional electron transport pathways. Moreover, density functional theory calculations were performed to elucidate the Li uptake/removal mechanism in the MoO2 electrodes, which can help us understand the unique cycling behavior of MoO2 material.

However, only one putative mirtron, osa-MIR1429, has been identified in rice (Oryza sativa). We employed a high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data-and structure-based approach to do a genome-wide search for the mirtron candidate in both Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) and rice. Five and eighteen candidates were discovered in the two plants respectively. To investigate their biological roles, the targets of these mirtrons were predicted and validated based on degradome sequencing data. The result indicates that the mirtrons could guide target cleavages to exert their regulatory roles post-transcriptionally, which needs further experimental validation.

With the incorporation of amorphous acrylic copolymer into the gallery of PVDF lamellae, the molecular connection (tie molecule concentration) between the neighboring PVDF crystals decreases gradually. For the blends with more than 80 wt % PVDF, most of the PVDF alpha-crystals are transformed into beta-crystals upon deformation, and the molecular chains of the beta-crystals are aligned along the stretching direction because tie molecules transfer the loading effectively. For the blends with less than 30 wt % PVDF, almost all of the PVDF crystals are isolated from each other with very few tie molecules. Mechanical deformation induces the perpendicular crystal molecular chain arrangement with no crystal form transitions. For the blends with 40 wt % to 70 wt % PVDF, the c-axis-oriented beta-phase and the tilt-oriented alpha-phase coexist in the uniaxially stretched blends. The shape-memory properties of the blends were also evaluated over the same blend composition range. The maximum shape-memory recovery properties were observed for the blend sample containing 50 wt % PVDF, in which a small amount of tie molecules connect the PVDF crystallites to form a deformable elastic network. This network contributes to the good shape-memory properties of the blend. For the blends with very few tie molecules or high tie molecule concentrations, the deformation induces the slipping of the amorphous molecules or the large fibrillar crystal structure, respectively; thus, these samples exhibit relatively low shape-memory performance.

Here we sought to clarify the possible mechanism of this unwanted increase in proportion of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice after CTX treatment. We found that both CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells underwent an expansion and activation before the increase of MDSCs in the early period of CTX treatment in 4T1 breast tumor-bearing mice. The proportion of MDSCs in nude mice lacking T cells after CTX therapy was comparable to that in nude mice without CTX treatment. T cell transfer to 4T1-bearing nude mice enhanced the proportion of MDSCs in tumor-bearing mice after CTX therapy. The co-culture of MDSCs and T cells in vitro also showed that CD4(+) T cells and CD8(+) T cells could facilitate the expansion and survival of MDSCs, and this effect was mediated by IFN-gamma released by T cells. These results gave an explanation of the unwanted consequence resulted from CTX treatment in tumor-bearing mice. It also provided some insights into the strategies for eliminating the bad side of CTX treatment and to make it more effective in cancer therapy. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We found that the infrared absorbance values of FTIR spectra differed significantly between U. elongata samples from seven distributed regions. We defined four genetic groups (clades) of U. elongata by differences in 16 characteristic absorbance peaks. The trees (named by regions) were sorted as follows: Shexian Anhui (AHSX) and Lin'an Zhejiang (ZJLA) in clade I, Kaihua (ZJKH), Suichang Zhejiang (ZJSC), and Wuning Jiangxi (JXWN) in (clade II); Songyang Zhejiang (ZJSY) in clade III, and Nanping Fujian (FJNP) clade IV. Thermogravimetric and differential thermal analysis revealed that the leaves of U. elongata had two obvious exothermic pyrolysis stages, and reached maximum mass loss near 550 degrees C. TG and DT curves between 350 and 550 degrees C were also used to elucidate the phylogenic relationship between U. elongata samples. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Samples were collected monthly at six sampling stations within a contamination gradient. Physico-chemical variables, such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP) and total nitrogen, were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. The phytoplankton communities showed a clear spatial pattern in response to the changes in environmental parameters, especially COD, TN and TP. Phytoplankton-based saprobien indices may reflect the spatial variation in water quality status (from beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic zone) in the canal system. However, species diversity, richness and evenness failed to discriminate between different levels of water quality status although these parameters are often used to summarize community relationships with environmental conditions. These results suggest that phytoplankton communities, but not diversity indices, can be used as a potential bioindicator of water quality in freshwater river systems.

More importantly, the semifluorinated BeO sheet exhibits an intrinsic half-metallic behavior, which is robust with a large half-metal gap and a high Curie temperature above room temperature. By the same strategy of fluorination, the half-metallicity can also be achieved in the one-dimensional BeO nanotubes and nanoribbons. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper presented a new spatial and temporal data fusion model (STDFM) for blending Landsat and MODIS surface reflectance. Temporal change information was detected from sequence coarser resolution surface images, and new high resolution reflectance was predicted from former high resolution reflectance. This algorithm was tested in red and near-infrared MODIS and Landsat ETM + images, and over a study area in Jiangning country, Nanjing, Jiangsu, China. Results showed that STDFM was able to produce images very similar with actual observed images. The correlation coefficient r between synthetic imageries and actual observations was 0.939. The correlation coefficient r between NDVI calculated by synthetic imageries and actual observations was 0.938.

The structures of compounds were established on the basis of spectroscopic analyses. Compounds 1, 2, and 3 were obtained from Phoma species for the first time. Additionally, the compounds were subjected to bioactivity assays, including antimicrobial activity, against four plant pathogenic fungi (Fusarium oxysporium, Rhizoctonia solani, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Magnaporthe oryzae) and two plant pathogenic bacteria (Xanthomonas campestris and Xanthomonas oryzae), as well as in vitro antitumor activities against HT-29, SMMC-772, MCF-7, HL-60, MGC80-3, and P388 cell lines. Compound 1 showed growth inhibition against F. oxysporium and R. solani with EC50 values of 413.22 and 48.5 mu g/mL, respectively. Additionally, compound 1 showed no cytotoxicity, whereas compound 2 exhibited cytotoxic activity against the six tumor cell lines tested, with IC50 values of 9.3 +/- 2.8, 27.87 +/- 1.78, 48.79 +/- 2.56, 37.57 +/- 1.65, 27.83 +/- 0.48, and 30.37 +/- 0.28 mu M, respectively. We conclude that endophytic Phoma are promising sources of natural bioactive and novel metabolites.

Methods: All the animals were divided into six groups (A-F). The rats in groups A and B received no pretreatment. The rats in groups C and D received subcutaneous injection of capsaicin or control vehicle, respectively, near the DPN for 2 days. Those in groups E and F had the DPN exposed to capsaicin or control vehicle, respectively, for 20 min. Subsequently, pressor responses were induced by stimulation of paraventricular nucleus (PVN) either electrically (groups A and C-F) or chemically via injection of glutamate (group B). After two stable pressor responses (baseline), all groups were subject to 5-min DPN stimulation followed by PVN stimulation for 10 S. Arterial blood pressure, heart rate, and electrocardiogram were recorded. The pressor response was calculated as the difference in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) before and after PVN stimulation, and changes from baseline in pressor response after DPN stimulation were compared between the groups. Results: Increases of MAP of 22.88 +/- 2.18 mm Hg and 20.32 +/- 5.25 mm Hg were induced by electrical (group A) or chemical (group B) stimulation of the PVN, respectively. These pressor responses were inhibited by stimulation of the DPN, and the MAP was reduced to 12.00 +/- 2.10 mm Hg in group A (n=6, P<0.01) and 7.00 +/- 2.85 mm Hg in group B (n=6, P<0.01). Subcutaneous injection of capsaicin (125 mg/kg) near the DPN in group C (n=7) had no effect on the inhibitory effect of DPN stimulation compared with the group D (n=9), and neither did blockade of nociceptive fibers with capsaicin in group E (n=6) compared with group F (n=8). Conclusion: Stimulation of the DPN mimicking acupuncture has an inhibitory effect on the pressor response, and the effect is mediated by capsaicin-insensitive afferent fibers in the DPN.

Narrower absorption and large blue-shift of photoluminescence bands as well as 50, 45, and 57 times enhanced intensities were obtained after being encapsulated in the channels of VSB-1 for dye 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The three dyes selected for encapsulation in VSB-1 emit red, green, and blue lights, respectively, which favor their application in optical devices. Thus, the narrower FWHM and higher emission efficiency for dyes encapsulated in VSB-1 materials make them good candidates for tricolor lamps, light-emitting diode, or miscellaneous materials.

Background: In Guangxi, China, foot care resources are limited, and diabetes self-management and foot care is poor for patients with diabetes. Thus developing a program with the limited resources for diabetes foot care is very important. Methods: A multidisciplinary team led by a diabetes nurse was established. A foot care kit and set of teaching materials focusing on foot care and diabetes self-management was developed. Sixty-two inpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, under the same attending physician's service, were screened to be at high risk for foot ulcers and randomized into 2 groups. The subjects in the study group received didactic diabetes education, tailored foot care and focused teaching for 2 hours. Every patient was given a foot care kit during hospitalization and then followed up in the clinic monthly with a systematic foot exam. Subsequently, diabetes education classes were given every 3 to 6 months. The subjects in the control group were just given usual care according to 2007 Americans with Disabilities Act standards. Results: For patients in the study group, the average score of knowledge and self foot care behaviours were higher than those of the patients in the control group both after 1 year (88.31 +/- 8.15, 86.35 +/- 5.17 vs. 70.27 +/- 7.92, 75.86 +/- 6.19) and 2 years (87.24 +/- 6.20, 89.56 +/- 7.00 vs. 71.43 +/- 5.17, 67.87 +/- 5.26). The mean A1C (6.5% +/- 2.3% vs. 7.9% +/- 4.2%), the incidence of foot ulcer (0% vs. 24.14%), and amputation (0% vs. 6.90%) were much lower than that of the patients in the control group after 2 years. Conclusion: The foot care program delivered by a multidisciplinary team can markedly improve foot care behaviours and reduce complications of the minority diabetes patients who are at risk of developing foot ulcer, thereby reducing the incidence of foot ulcer and amputation. In areas where resources are limited, the foot care program will be a cost-effective approach to reduce the incidence of diabetes foot ulcer.

J	Pan, Y; Luo, QY				Pan, Yi; Luo, Qian-Ying			Working memory modulates the perception of time	PSYCHONOMIC BULLETIN & REVIEW			English	Article						Working memory; Time perception; Subjective duration; Magnitude	NEURAL MECHANISMS; PERCEIVED DURATION; ATTENTION; GUIDANCE	Recent research has indicated that reentrant feedback from the contents of working memory can enhance neural representations and the perceptual strengths of matching stimuli in the visual field. However, whether the contents of working memory can also distort conscious experiences of perception remains unclear. Our present results show that the durations of perceptual stimuli matching the nontemporal representations in working memory tend to be perceived as longer than those of mismatching stimuli. This is the first demonstration that working memory can lead to distortions of time perception. Our findings are consistent with the ideas that the perceived duration of a stimulus depends on the magnitude of the neural responses to that stimulus in visual cortex and that there is a common system for representing both temporal and nontemporal magnitudes. We conclude that top-down modulation from the nontemporal contents of working memory distorts the perceptual experience of temporal duration.

At the end of May 2007, an odor pollution incident occurred at the Tianziling landfill site, Hangzhou. China, where the residents lodged complaints about the intense odor from the landfill, which drew a significant attention from the government. In this study, ambient air monitoring was conducted at the Tianziling landfill site. The main odor composition of the gas samples collected on June 1st 2007 and the reduction of various odorous gases from the samples collected on June 1st 2009 due to the applied odor control techniques were determined using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). In addition, variations of primary odorous gaseous (NH3 and H2S) concentrations at different locations in the landfill site from July 2007 to June 2009 were also investigated by using classical spectrophotometric methods. Results showed that a total of 68 volatile compounds were identified among which H2S (56.58-579.84 mu g/m(3)) and NH3 (520-4460 mu g/m(3)) were the notable odor components contributing to 4.47-10.92% and 83.91-93.94% of total concentrations, respectively. Similar spatial and temporal shifts of H2S and NH3 concentrations were observed and were significantly affected by environmental factors including temperature, air pressure and wind direction. Odor pollution was worse when high temperature, high humidity, low air pressure, and southeast, northeast or east wind appeared. Moreover, the environmental sampling points of the dumping area and the leachate treatment plant were found to be the main odor sources at the Tianziling landfill site. The odor control technologies used in this project had a good mitigating effect on the primary odorous compounds. This study provides long-term valuable information concerning the characteristics and control of odors at landfill sites in a long run. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, it lacks serious consideration of social preference in Supply Chain Management. In this paper, we develop an evolutionary decision-making model to characterize the effects of suppliers' altruism in supply networks, and find that the performances of both suppliers and supply chains are improved by introducing the role of altruism. Furthermore, an interesting and reasonable phenomenon is discovered that the suppliers' and whole network's profits do not change monotonously with suppliers' altruistic preference, eta, but reach the best at eta = 0.6 and eta = 0.4, respectively. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the effects of altruism for both research and commercial applications. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The transcriptional mechanisms by which dorsal interneurons choose between ipsilateral and contralateral projection fates are unknown. Here, we show that a single transcription factor (TF), BARHL2, regulates this choice in proprioceptive dI1 interneurons by selectively suppressing cardinal dI1contra features in dI1ipsi neurons, despite expression by both subtypes. Strikingly, dI1ipsi neurons in Barhl2-null mice exhibit a dI1contra cell settling pattern in the medial deep dorsal horn, and, most importantly, they project axons contralaterally. These aberrations are preceded by ectopic dI1ipsi expression of the defining dI1contra TF, LHX2, and down-regulation of the dI1ipsi-enriched TF, BARHL1. Taken together, these results elucidate BARHL2 as a critical postmitotic regulator of dI1 subtype diversification, as well as its intermediate position in the dI1 genetic hierarchy.

Based on another MATLAB GUI toolkit, Resting State fMRI Data Analysis Toolkit (REST), we implemented GCA on MATLAB as a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit. This toolkit, namely REST-GCA, could output both the residual-based F and the signed-path coefficient. REST-GCA also intergrates a programme that could transform the distribution of residual-based F to approximately normal distribution and then permit parametric statistical inference at group level. Using REST-GCA, we tested the causal effect of the right frontal-insular cortex (rFIC) onto each voxel in the whole brain, and vice versa, each voxel in the whole brain on the rFIC, in a voxel-wise way in a resting-state fMRI dataset from 30 healthy college students. Using Jarque-Bera goodness-of-fit test and the Lilliefors goodness-of-fit test, we found that the transformation from F to P and the further standardization from F to Z score substantially improved the normality. The results of one sample t-tests on Z score showed bi-directional positive causal effect between rFIC and the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). One sample t-tests on the signed-path coefficients showed positive causal effect from rFIC to dACC but negative from dACC to rFIC. All these results indicate that REST-GCA may be useful toolkit for caudal analysis of fMRI data. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, IRSs have not yet been reported in planar excitable media. In the present work we investigate rotating waves in a nonuniform excitable medium, consisting of an inner disk part surrounded by an outer ring part with different excitabilities, by numerical simulations of a simple FitzHugh-Nagumo model. Depending on the excitability of the medium as well as the inhomogeneity, we find the occurrence of IRSs, of which the excitation propagates inwardly to the geometrical spiral tip.

The size and size distribution of nanocapsules were measured by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The particle morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The final morphology of particles was strongly influenced by the hydrophobicity of functional monomers. The use of a hydrophilic functional monomer, acrylic acid, led to the formation of solid particles, while the use of the more hydrophobic functional monomer, 4-VP, resulted in the formation of nanocapsules. The particle morphology, size, and size distribution were investigated in terms of the content of 4-VP, MBA, and the type and content of surfactant. The pH- and thermo-sensitivities were characterized by measuring the size variation with the change of temperature and pH. The organic-inorganic nanocapsules were prepared by coating a layer of silica particles on the surface of the sensitive nanocapsules.

After 360 days of cultivation using MSG wastewater, obvious anammox activity was observed in all three cultures. The maximum specific anammox activities of cultures S1, S2 and S3 were 0.11 kg N kg(-1) VSS day(-1), 0.09 kg N kg(-1) VSS day(-1) and 0.16 kg N kg(-1) VSS day(-1), respectively. Brownish-red anammox granules having diameters in the range of 0.2-1.0 mm were visible in cultures Si and S2, and large red granules having diameters in the range of 0.5-2.5 mm were formed in culture S3 after 420 days of cultivation. Phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA genes showed that Kuenenia organisms were the dominant anammox species in all three cultures. The copy numbers of 16S rRNA genes of anammox bacteria in cultures Si, S2 and S3 were 6.8 x 10(7) copies mL(-1), 9.4 x 10(7) copies mL(-1) and 7.5 x 10(8) copies mL(-1), respectively. The results of this study demonstrated that anammox cultivation from conventional activated sludges was highly possible using MSG wastewater. Thus the anammox process has possibility of applying to the nitrogen removal from MSG wastewater. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The thermal behaviors and morphological change in the blends of Nylon 6 (PA6) and PVP were investigated in details via WAXD, DSC, FT-IR and POM methods. The equilibrium melting temperatures for PA6 in the blends were estimated based on the linear and nonlinear Hoffman-Weeks (LHW and NLHW) extrapolative methods. With increasing the mass ratio of PVP to PA6, T-m (melting temperature) and T-c (crystallization temperature) of PA6 in blends both decreased as well as that of the spherulite size of PA6. The interaction mode between PVP and PA6 was investigated by FT-IR spectroscopy, and the spectral changes indicated that the carbonyl groups of PVP had formed hydrogen bonding with the N-H groups of PA6 molecules in the molten state, which resulted in the variation of the morphology and thermal behaviors.

Since MS spectra of 1,9-diphenyl-9H-fluorene with these four groups and their isomers are similar, it is difficult to distinguish them from its isomers. Multistage tandem mass spectrometry analysis involves selecting molecular ions obtained in MS spectra as precursor ions in the MS/MS process, and the fragment [C25H17](+) (m/z 317) obtained in MS/MS spectra as a precursor ion in MS3 processes. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) experiments at different activation energies were done to elucidate possible fragmentation pathways. Proposed fragmentation pathways including m/z 317 and structures of the product ions are acquired simultaneously. At a higher CID voltage, the isomers of C25H17-CF3 can be distinguished in MS/MS, while the isomers of C25H17-CH3, C25H17-Cl and C25H17-Br can be distinguished in MS3. This work can provide new and valuable information needed for unambiguous characterization of such substances in complex sample matrices.

The aim of the present study was to investigate brain structural damage in COPD. Design: Retrospective case control study. Patients with COPD and healthy volunteers were recruited. The two groups were matched in age, gender and educational background. Setting: A hospital and a number of communities: they are all located in southern Fujian province, China. Participants: 25 stable patients and 25 controls were enrolled from December 2009 to May 2011. Methods: Using voxel-based morphometry and tract-based spatial statistics based on MRI to analyse grey matter (GM) density and white matter fractional anisotropy (FA), respectively, and a battery of neuropsychological tests were performed. Results: Patients with COPD (vs controls) showed decreased GM density in the limbic and paralimbic structures, including right gyrus rectus, left precentral gyrus, bilateral anterior and middle cingulate gyri, bilateral superior temporal gyri, bilateral anterior insula extending to Rolandic operculum, bilateral thalamus/pulvinars and left caudate nucleus. Patients with COPD (vs controls) had decreased FA values in the bilateral superior corona radiata, bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus, bilateral optic radiation, bilateral lingual gyri, left parahippocampal gyrus and fornix. Lower FA values in these regions were associated with increased radial diffusivity and no changes of longitudinal diffusivity. Patients with COPD had poor performances in the Mini-Mental State Examination, figure memory and visual reproduction. GM density in some decreased regions in COPD had positive correlations with arterial blood Po-2, negative correlations with disease duration and also positive correlations with visual tasks. Conclusion: The authors demonstrated that COPD exhibited loss of regional GM accompanied by impairment of white matter microstructural integrity, which was associated with disease severity and may underlie the pathophysiological and psychological changes of COPD.

We constructed an integrated genetic linkage map of an F-1 population derived from an interspecific cross between D. officinale and D. aduncum (both, 2n = 38), using expressed sequence tag-simple sequence repeats (EST-SSR) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP). A total of 349 polymorphic loci, including 261 SRAP loci and 88 EST-SSR loci, were identified for genetic linkage analysis. The software JoinMap 4.0 was used to construct the genetic maps. A total of 157 loci were arranged into 27 major linkage groups, each containing a minimum of four markers, and a further 23 markers were distributed to five triplets and four doublets, the frame map covered a total distance of 1580.4 cM, with a mean of 11.89 cM between adjacent markers. This primary map of the D. officinale and D. aduncum hybrid provides a basis for genetic studies and should facilitate future studies of medical traits mapping and marker-assisted selection in Dendrobium species breeding programs.

Provably secure convertible multi-authenticated encryption scheme	IET INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article							CRYPTANALYSIS; IMPROVEMENT; SIGNATURE	In 2009, Tsai proposed an efficient convertible multi-authenticated encryption (CMAE) scheme. However, the author shows that his scheme is distinguishable under adaptive chosen-message attack, and that the designated verifier can generate the signature of the same message for other verifiers. Since no formal model of CMAE has been presented in the literature, the author presents the first complete formal model of CMAE. Then, a new scheme is proposed. The proposed scheme is provably secure in the random oracle model.

The dynamics of CO2 and CH4 fluxes for plant-soil ecosystems in a ventilated transparent greenhouse were evaluated after a pig manure compost or inorganic fertiliser application at the rate of 150 kg N ha(-1) during Brassica chinensis growth from seedling to maturity. Gas samples for the plant-soil ecosystems were collected using a static chamber approach, and the concentrations of CO2 and CH4 were determined using gas chromatography. The results showed that CO2 was fixed by the plant-soil ecosystem during Brassica chinensis growth after fertilisation and the CO2 and CH4 fluxes were not significantly different among the treatments compared with the control. The ecosystem uptake of CO2 increased with the soil temperature and the variation was in agreement with a first-order exponential curve. The temperature sensitivity of the CO2 efflux at the ecosystem level for the pig manure compost, inorganic fertiliser and control treatments were 7.97, 9.82 and 8.88, respectively. There was a positive correlation between the soil microbial biomass carbon and the CO2 uptake for both fertiliser treatments, whereas the CO2 uptake for the control treatment was increased by the soil microbial biomass nitrogen. The plant-soil ecosystems were minor CH4 sinks and sources, and the CH4 flux ranged from -5.56 to 4.23 mg CH4 m(-2)h(-1) for all of the treatments. The CH4 consumption for the pig manure compost and inorganic fertiliser treatments were negatively correlated with the soil microbial biomass nitrogen, whereas that for the control treatment showed a significant negative correlation with the soil nitrate-N. The results indicate that a plant-soil ecosystem could be a carbon sink, and that fertiliser application had no significant effects on either the CO2 or the CH4 uptake in a plant-soil ecosystem.

With the assistance of supercritical carbon dioxide (SC CO2), ultrafine PtRu nanoparticles with an average size of 2.87 nm were very uniformly distributed on the surfaces of functionalized graphene sheets (FGSs) by the reduction of a mixture of H2PtCl6 and RuCl3 precursors. The catalytic property of the as-prepared composites for methanol oxidation was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and chronoamperometry. In comparison with their carbon black (Vulcan XC-72) counterparts, the PtRu/FGSs composites showed considerably improved catalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation. The high surface area of graphene and even distribution of ultrafine bimetallic particles are vital for the superior electrocatalytic performance of the PtRu/FGSs composites. The findings suggest that highly efficient graphene-supported metallic electrocatalysts can be fabricated by the supercritical fluid method and graphene as a favorable electrocatalytic carrier, which has promising potential application in direct methanol fuel cells.

J	Lin, LH; Mao, F; Chen, C; Ji, X				Lin, Long-Hui; Mao, Fei; Chen, Ce; Ji, Xiang			Reproductive traits of the gray ratsnake Ptyas korros from three geographically distinct populations	CURRENT ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Colubridae; Life-history; Reproductive output; Egg size; Clutch size; Geographical variation; Egg-laying date	LIFE-HISTORY EVOLUTION; EGG-SIZE; OFFSPRING SIZE; CLUTCH SIZE; PHENOTYPIC PLASTICITY; TRADE-OFFS; KING RATSNAKE; BODY-SIZE; LIZARD; NUMBER	We collected gravid gray rat snakes Ptyas korros from three geographically distinct populations in China, Chenzhou (CZ), Jiangshan (JS) and Dinghai (DH), to study geographical variation in female reproductive traits. Egg-laying dates differed among the three populations such that at the most northern latitude egg-laying was latest, and earliest at the most southern latitutde. Clutch size, clutch mass, egg mass, egg shape, within clutch variability in egg sizes and relative clutch mass differed among the three populations, whereas post-oviposition body mass did not. Except for egg-laying date, none of the traits examined varied in a geographically continuous trend. CZ and DH females, although separated by a distance of approximately 1100 km as the crow flies, were similar in nearly all traits examined. JS females were distinguished from CZ and DH females by their higher fecundity (clutch size), greater reproductive output (clutch mass) and more rounded eggs. Our data do not validate the prediction that larger offspring should be produced in colder localities. The absence of an egg size-number trade-off in each of the three populations presumably suggests that P. korros is among species where eggs are well optimized for size within a population [Current Zoology 58 (6): 820-827, 2012].

This method simultaneously prevented the agglomeration of SWCNTs and caused strong interfacial bonding, while the electronic properties of the SWCNTs remained intact. As a result, the high conductivity of the carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and the flexibility of the elastomeric matrix were retained, producing optimum electrical and mechanical properties. A composite material with a loading of 20 wt% SWCNTs was fabricated with excellent mechanical properties and a high conductivity (9500 S m(-1)). The method could be used to form transparent thin conductive films that could tolerate over 800 bend cycles at a bending angle of 180 degrees while maintaining a constant sheet resistance.

However, the existing state of the art multisignatures often suffers from the following problems: impractical key setup assumptions, loose security reductions and inefficient signature verification. In this paper, we propose a non-interactive multisignature scheme with tight security reduction in the random oracle model. Our proposed multisignatures address the above three problems by achieving: provable security in the plain public key model; tight security reduction under the standard Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption and O(1) computational time for signature verification through pre-computation. Hence, our non-interactive multisignatures are of great use in routing authentication of networks.

A ring R is called an almost unit-regular ring provided that for any a is an element of R, either a or 1 - a is unit-regular. We characterize, in this article, the almost unit-regularity of Morita contexts with zero pairings. We also show that a ring R is unit-regular if and only if M-2(R) is almost unit-regular. Various examples of such rings are constructed by means of formal triangular matrix rings.

An instrument developed by the researchers and teachers was used to measure students' graph reading abilities. Results indicated that: (a) students' abilities of reading the three kinds of scientific information improved with grade; (b) students in different grades showed significant differences in reading all kinds of information except for the topics and special segments of the graphs for explicit information, tacit information requiring using mathematics tools, and conclusive information from comparison; and (c) as a whole, students of the same grade showed variation in their abilities of reading different kinds of information but the patterns of difference among the three kinds of information for the three grades were similar. This study has many implications for science education in China. It may help teachers understand students' thinking approaches to graphs and foster their abilities of interpreting them, and further inform future studies on how to adopt and design graphs in science textbooks.

D-2-NpTPS shows redder absorption and emission than D-1-NpTPS due to the better conjugation between naphthalen-2-yl groups and phenyl rings at the 2,5-positions of the silole core. While they are weakly fluorescent in solutions, strong luminescence is induced when aggregated in poor solvents or fabricated into solid films, with high fluorescence quantum yields up to 99%, demonstrating their aggregation-induced emission (AIE) feature. Efficient non-doped organic light-emitting diodes utilizing D-1-NpTPS and D-2-NpTPS as light-emitting layers are fabricated. Remarkably high electroluminescence efficiencies of 10.5 cd A(-1), 7.3 lm W-1, and 3.2% are acheived by the D-2-NpTPS device.

Spectroscopic properties of all the dyes in various solvents and on films have been investigated. In comparison with the corresponding monomers, the dimers exhibit higher molar absorption coefficients, relative moderate fluorescent quantum yields and redshifted wavelengths. The luminescence yields of the dimers are solvent polarity dependent and decrease dramatically in acetonitrile. More intensive solid-state emission of triphenylsilylphenyl substituted BODIPY dimer is observed with a quantum yield of 9.7% relative to the phenyl substituted dimer, which could be attributed to the introduction of the bulky group that inhibits aggregation.

Upon collisional activation, the proton transfers from the carbonyl oxygen to the dissociative protonation site at the amide nitrogen atom or the alpha-carbon atom, leading to the formation of important reactive intermediates. When the amide nitrogen atom is protonated, the amide bond is facile to rupture to form ion/neutral complex 1, [RC6H4CH=CHCO+/aniline]. Besides the dissociation of the complex, proton transfer reaction from the alpha-carbon atom to the nitrogen atom within the complex takes place, leading to the formation of protonated aniline. The presence of electron-withdrawing groups favored the proton transfer reaction, whereas electron-donating groups strongly favored the dissociation (aniline loss). When the proton transfers from the carbonyl oxygen to the alpha-carbon atom, the cleavage of the C-alpha-CONHPh bond results in another ion/neutral complex 2, [PhNHCO+/RC6H4CH=CH2]. However, in this case, electron-donating groups expedited the proton transfer reaction from the charged to the neutral partner to eliminate phenyl isocyanate. Besides the cleavage of the C-alpha-CONHPh bond, intramolecular nucleophilic substitution (a nucleophilic attack of the nitrogen atom at the beta-carbon) and stepwise proton transfer reactions (two 1,2-H shifts) also take place when the alpha-carbon atom is protonated, resulting in the loss of ketene and RC6H5, respectively. In addition, the H/D exchanges between the external deuterium and the amide hydrogen, vinyl hydrogens and the hydrogens of the phenyl rings were discovered by D-labeling experiments. Density functional theory-based (DFT) calculations were performed to shed light on the mechanisms for these reactions.

Sampling and Methods: We tested 21 outpatients with panic disorder and 34 healthy subjects, with a photo set from the Matsumoto and Ekman Japanese and Caucasian facial expressions of emotion, which includes anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. Results: Compared to the healthy subjects, patients showed lower accuracies when recognizing disgust and fear, but a higher accuracy when recognizing surprise. Conclusions:These results suggest that the altered specificity to these emotions leads tso self-awareness mechanisms to prevent further emotional reactions in panic disorder patients.

Among them, the dye (Z)-2,3-bis(4'-(diphenylamino)-[1,1'-biphenyl]-4-yl)acrylonitrile (CNS-4) nanoparticle suspension shows the polarity-dependent characteristics of the fluorescence properties. By the fluorescence spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis, the restriction of transfer from the local excited (LE) state to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) state and crystal formation results in a blue-shift in emission and enhances the intensity in the aggregate state. Additionally, the luminophors CNS-3 and CNS-4 possess the AIEE effect as well as mechanochromic fluorescent properties. This mechanofluorochromic behavior originates from the change between the crystalline and the amorphous state.

A BLASTP search of GenBank revealed that ORF6 encoded a 355-amino acid putative endoxylanase, having 61% similarity (e(-73)) to endo-1,4-beta-xylanase of Fibrobacter succinogenes S85 (YP_003250510.1). Predicted with the SWISS-MODEL, there were two separate beta-sandwich clusters linked with a high serine containing linker in ORF6. The N-terminal beta-sandwich is a novel endoxylanase of the glycosyl hydrolase family 11 with a specific activity of 1150.00 U/mg. The optimal pH and temperature for this enzyme were shown to be pH 5.0 and 50 degrees C, respectively. The C-terminal helped increase the stability of the xylanase but decreased the activity to some degree. The C-terminal beta-sandwich could bind avicel, but no conserved domain could be found. It may be a novel carbohydrate-binding module.

It shows that the uncertainty product of the LPFT of an arbitrary order is related to the parameters of the signal and the window function, in addition to the errors of estimating the polynomial coefficients. Important factors that affect resolutions of signal representation, such as the window width, the length of overlap between signal segments, order mismatch and estimation errors of polynomial coefficients, are discussed. The effects of minimizing computational complexities on signal representation by reducing the order of the transform and the overlap length between signal segments are also examined. In terms of the signal concentration, comparisons among the short-time Fourier transform, the Wigner-Ville distribution and the second order LPFT are presented. The LPFT is shown to be an excellent candidate providing better representations for time-varying signals.

First- and second-year university students (N = 257) completed the measures of cooperativeness, competitiveness, neuroticism, and student burnout. Results show that cooperativeness had a negative correlation with each of the dimensions of burnout. Competitiveness did not have a negative correlation. For an individual with high neuroticism, cooperativeness did not contribute to professional efficacy but competitiveness tended to counteract any diminishing professional efficacy.

X-ray single crystal structural analysis showed that the coordination geometries of metal ions in these complexes are similar and they are cation-anion species. The hydrogen-bonding structures are 1-D chains through the N-H center dot center dot center dot Cl bonds. There are weak stacking interactions between pyridine rings in 1-4, while there are no stacking interactions in 5 and 6. We have investigated the transesterification of phenyl acetate with methanol catalyzed by 1-6 under mild conditions; 1-4 are homogeneous catalysts while 5 and 6 are heterogeneous catalysts due to their poor solubility in methanol. Cobalt complexes exhibit higher catalytic activities than corresponding nickel complexes. Complex 4 is the best catalyst of these six complexes.

Here, we have synthesized a wide range of sugar-based benzothiazoles from readily accessible glycosyl thioureas by chemoselective, palladium-catalyzed C-S coupling reactions. Corroborated by theoretical calculations, a mechanistic investigation indicates that the coordination to the palladium by a pivaloyl carbonyl group and the presence of intramolecular hydrogen bonding play important roles in the efficiency and chemoselectivity of reaction. These fluorescent glycoconjugates can be observed to readily enter mammalian tumor cells and exhibit potential in vitro antitumor activity.

J	Shi-xu				Shi-xu			Understanding contemporary Chinese political communication A historico-intercultural analysis and assessment of its discourse of human rights	JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND POLITICS			English	Article						historical; intercultural; change; response; hegemony; categories of discourse		In the international scholarship, Chinese political communication is usually viewed from a political-economic and West-centric perspective. Consequently, it is portrayed as a product of the Chinese Communist Party('s ideology), deviant, totalitarian and unchanging. In this article I first argue for a historical and intercultural approach and so a view of contemporary Chinese political discourse as dynamic, critical-creative and cultural-hegemony-resistant. Then I analyze and assess accordingly the case of the Chinese discourse of human rights. It will be seen that this discourse has been evolving topically, reinforcing socially, and responding interculturally, thereby constituting a historic transformation in China's human rights situation on the one hand and a counter-veiling force in the unbalanced international communication on human rights on the other. In conclusion I suggest that the mainstream scholarship go beyond the a-historical-and-a-intercultural approach to political communication in general and to that of non-Western societies in particular.

The aim of this study was to (1) examine the hypothesis that Pb alters calmodulin content and (2) assess the effects of Pb on proliferation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) levels in lymphocytes. The influence of Pb on calmodulin content in mouse lymphocytes was assessed by western blot, while the proliferation of lymphocytes was studied using MTT test, and IL-2 level by ELISA assay. The results showed that 100 mu M PbCl2 decreased calmodulin content, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced proliferation, and IL-2 levels, but a lower concentration (1 mu M PbCl2) did not appear to be effective. Evidence indicates that IL-2 levels and lymphocyte proliferation might not be calmodulin content dependent. Our data suggested that Pb2+-induced toxicity was likely to be complex with multiple factors involved, including calmodulin, IL-2, and proliferation of lymphocytes.

In this study, we investigated the effects of three cytokines on CD40 expression in Myb-transformed hematological cells and their regulatory roles in promoting these cells into dendritic cells. We observed that both interleukin-4 and interferon-gamma increased CD40 expression in these hematological cells in a dose-dependent manner, although the concentration required for interleukin-4 was significantly higher than that for interferon-gamma. We found that tumour necrosis factor-alpha promoted CD40 expression induced by interferon-gamma, but not by interleukin-4. Our data showed that tumour necrosis factor-alpha plus interferon-gamma-treated Myb-transformed hematological cells had the greatest ability to take up and process the model antigen DQ-Ovalbumin. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha also increased the ability of interferon-gamma to produce the mixed lymphocyte reaction to allogenic T cells. Furthermore, only cotreatment with tumour necrosis factor-alpha and interferon-gamma induced Myb-transformed hematological cells to express interleukin-6. These results suggest that tumour necrosis factor-alpha plays a key regulatory role in the development of dendritic cells from hematological progenitor cells induced by interferon-gamma.

The hydrolysis rates decrease in the order SO42-/TiO2/Nd3+ > SO42-/TiO2/Y3+ > SO42-/TiO2/Sm3+ > SO42-/TiO2. The hydrolysis of MePhSi(OEt)(2) is a first-order reaction with respect to the concentration of MePhSi(OEt)(2), and the hydrolysis rate constant increases with increasing temperature. The activation energy E-a and the pre-exponential factor for this hydrolysis catalyzed by SO42-/TiO2/Nd3+ have been determined as 322.50 kJ mol(-1) and 7.12 x 10(41) s(-1), respectively. The products of the hydrolysis are oligomers of polymethylphenylsiloxane. The mechanism of MePhSi(OEt)(2) hydrolysis is also discussed.

The different reaction parameters such as ligand, catalyst, and surfactant were studied separately to control the polymerization of VAc. The results show that RATRP is not controlled with bpy as ligand, but it is possible to obtain PVAc with low PDI when PMDETA was used as ligand. The molecular weight and the PDI is 10.71 x 10(4) and 1.62 when the molar ratio of AIBN/CuCl2/PMDETA is 1.5:1:2, the molar ratio of AIBN to VAc is 0.5%, surfactant to deionized water is 10 wt%. The molecular weight and the PDI is 12.81 x 10(4) and 1.48 when the molar ratio of AIBN/CuCl2/PMDETA is 2:1:2. The structure of the polymer and the polymer conversion were investigated through H-1-NMR and gravity method separately.

The apparent Au surface coverage increases linearly with the nominal film thickness at low thicknesses and the rate of increase is almost independent of deposition flux. However, as the deposition flux increases, the surface coverage goes up linearly. Further analysis reveals that the deposition flux strongly affects the system free-energy of the island-oil system and therefore the aggregation behavior of the Au atoms and islands.

Their structures were characterized by IR, H-1-NMR, MS spectroscopic data and elementary analyses. The structure of compound (3a), C26H18Cl2N6S, was conclusively established with X-ray crystal structure analysis. It crystallizes in the Orthorhombic space group Pna2(1), with a = 17.8160(5), b = 18.9125(7), c = 14.7926(4), alpha = 90 degrees, beta = 90 degrees, gamma = 90 degrees and Dc = 1.379 mg/m(3) for Z = 8, V = 4984.3(3) angstrom, mu(Mo-K alpha) = 0.372 mm, lambda = 0.71070 angstrom, the final R = 0.0527 and wR = 0.1307 for 43309 observed reflections with I > 2 sigma(I). The structure is stabilized by weak C-H center dot center dot center dot N intramolecular hydrogen bonds and C-H center dot center dot center dot Cg p-ring intermolecular interactions and gives support to molecular packing stability in the unit cell.
