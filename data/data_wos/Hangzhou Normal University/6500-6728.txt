This reaction has demonstrated a tolerance to a wide range of functionalizations and can be performed under very mild conditions. A plausible mechanism has been proposed in which an Ugi-type cascade assembly has been included.

The results showed that follicle growth, differentiation, and steroidogenesis were significantly disturbed by >= 1.2 mu g/mL CdCl2. The germinal vesicle breakdown of oocyte was also disturbed dose-dependently after the culture follicles were exposed to >= 1.6 mu g/mL CdCl2. Exposure to CdCl2 with concentrations of 1.6 mu g/mL on day 2 had caused significant reduced (p < 0.05) survival rate and rate of antral follicles, and increased abnormal follicle rate significantly, compared to the group exposed on day 6. Rat preantral follicle culture is a potential tool to assess the hazards of chemical compounds on female fertility and can be used to elucidate their mechanisms of actions.

Until now, knowledge about their molecular information, localization and expression pattern is largely unavailable in plant species. One ICME in Arabidopsis, encoded by At5g15860, has been identified recently. Over-expression of At5g15860 caused an ABA hypersensitive phenotype in transgenic Arabidopsis plants, indicating that it functions as a positive regulator of ABA signaling. Moreover, ABA induced the expression of this gene in Arabidopsis seedlings. The current study extends these findings by examining the sub-cellular localization, expression profiling, and physiological functions of ICME and two other ICME-like proteins, ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2, which were encoded by two related genes At1g26120 and At3g02410, respectively. Results: Bioinformatics investigations showed that the ICME and other two ICME-like homologs comprise a small subfamily of carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) in Arabidopsis. Sub-cellular localization of GFP tagged ICME and its homologs showed that the ICME and ICME-like proteins are intramembrane proteins predominantly localizing in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi apparatus. Semi-quantitative and real-time quantitative PCR revealed that the ICME and ICME-like genes are expressed in all examined tissues, including roots, rosette leaves, cauline leaves, stems, flowers, and siliques, with differential expression levels. Within the gene family, the base transcript abundance of ICME-LIKE2 gene is very low with higher expression in reproductive organs (flowers and siliques). Time-course analysis uncovered that both ICME and ICME-like genes are up-regulated by mannitol, NaCl and ABA treatment, with ICME showing the highest level of up-regulation by these treatments. Heat stress resulted in up-regulation of the ICME gene significantly but down-regulation of the ICME-LIKE1 and ICME-LIKE2 genes. Cold and dehydration stimuli led to no significant change of both ICME and ICME-like gene expression. Mutant icme-like2-1 showed increased sensitivity to ABA but slightly decreased sensitivity to salt and osmotic stresses during seed germination. Conclusions: It is concluded that the ICME family is involved in stress and ABA signaling in Arabidopsis, probably through mediating the process of demethylating prenylated proteins. Identification of these prenylated proteins will help to better understand the significance of protein prenylation in Planta.

Skinks shifted their thermal preferences when fasted. Temporal variation in T-sel was not found within each sex x feeding condition combination, and neither in fed nor in fasted skinks did the mean values for T-sel differ between sexes. Body temperatures selected by fed skinks fell within the range from 30.2 to 33.9 degrees C, and those selected by fasted skinks within the range from 25.1 to 31.8 degrees C. Body temperatures (31.8 +/- 0.3 degrees C) selected by fed skinks were on average 4.0 degrees C higher than those (27.8 +/- 0.4 degrees C) selected by fasted skinks. Fasted skinks had no difficulty in attaining higher body temperatures, but they voluntarily shift their thermal preferences downwards to save energy. This finding suggests an adaptive mechanism adopted by many-lined sun skinks to enhance their fitness during the periods when food availability is low.

A note on the complexity of C-infinity-words	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Kolakoski sequence; C-infinity-word	NUMBER	Let gamma(n) be the number of C-infinity-words of length n. Say that a C-infinity-word w is left doubly extendable (LDE) if both 1w and 2w are C-infinity. We show that for any positive real number phi and positive integer N such that the proportion of 2's is greater than 1/2 - phi in each LDE word of length exceeding N, there are positive constants c(1) and c(2) such that c(1)n log 3/log((3/2)+phi+(2/N)) < gamma(n) < c(2)n log 3/log((3/2)-phi) for all positive integers n. With the best value known for phi, and large N, this gives c(1)n(2.7087) < gamma(n) < c(2)n(2.7102). (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their thermal stabilities have been investigated by TGA in an inert gas atmosphere. The temperature for 10% conversion, 50% conversion, and the temperature for the maximum rate of decomposition (MRDT) initiated from TGA curves recorded at a heating rate of 5, 10, 15, and 20 degrees C min(-1) and the apparent activation energy E(a) using the FWO method as a function of conversion alpha indicated that the thermal stabilities of the polysiloxanes could be enhanced either by modifying the structure of the polymer or by introducing a certain amount of a thermal additive. PDMS-PMPS copolymers with a MePhSiO segment content of 10.2 mol % and terminated by diphenylmethylsiloxyl groups exhibited optimal heat resistance. The thermal stabilities of the polysiloxanes could be further improved by introducing homogenous titanium additives and with the addition of 1550 ppm content of titanium additives, the temperature for 10% conversion, the temperature for 50% conversion, and MRDT have been found to be increased by 20.11, 71.28, and 98.67 K, respectively, relative to the unmodified PDMS-PMPS copolymer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) analysis has proven the formation of a Si-O-Ti bond in the titanium-modified PDMS-PMPS copolymer, which may be responsible for the efficient enhancement of its thermal stability.

We enrolled 245 eligible patients with ACS and compared the protein expression between the two groups, with or without major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). To determine biomarkers for prognosis, we performed mass spectrometry analysis. We found 10 proteins in the serum that can be used to classify ACS with or without MACE and specific protein peaks at m/z 1921.0, 2124.2, and 20887.3 that were increased in patients with MACE. These peaks reliably predict MACE occurrence in patients with ACS, in addition to the widely accepted markers troponin and brain natriuretic peptide precursor. The characteristic changes in the peaks at m/z 1921.09, 2124.2, and 20887.3 correlate with poor prognosis in ACS patients. These proteins could potentially be used as predictive biomarkers to evaluate patient prognosis. Anat Rec, 293:1512-1518, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

We compared egg size and egg contents among five populations of a lizard (Takydromus septentrionalis, Gunther, 1864) along a latitudinal gradient, and incubated eggs at two temperatures to determine the influence of maternal investment and incubation temperature on offspring size. The mean values for female size and egg size were both greater in the two northern populations (Chuzhou and Anji) than in the three southern populations (Lishui, Dongtou, and Ningde). The larger eggs were entirely attributable to the body size of females in the Anji population, but their increased size also stemmed from further enlargement of egg size relative to female body size in Chuzhou, the northernmost population sampled in this study. Eggs of the Chuzhou population contained more yolk and less water than those of southern populations. Despite the lower lipid content in the yolk, eggs from the Chuzhou population had higher energy contents than those from the two southern populations, owing to the larger egg size and increased volume of yolk. Hatchling size was not affected by incubation temperature, but differed significantly among populations, with hatchlings being larger in the Chuzhou population than in the other populations. Our data provide an inference that oviparous reptiles from cold climates may produce larger offspring, not only by increasing egg size but also by investing more energy into their eggs.

Many low energy structures of Ga7As7 cluster are found. It confirms that the ground state structure of neutral Ga7As7 cluster is a pentagonal prism with four face atoms like a basket structure, as reported by previous works. The ground state structures of positive Ga7As7 cluster ions are different from that of the neutral cluster. These investigations suggest that Ga atoms occupy the capping positions more easily than As atoms. Mulliken population analyses also show that Ga atoms can lose or obtain charge more easily than As atoms. It finds that the neutral Ga7As7 cluster can become more stable by gaining one or two additional electrons but further more electrons would cause the decrease of binding energy. The ionisation energy increases with the increase of the number of the removed electrons. These calculated results indicate that the net magnetic moment of the neutral Ga7As7 cluster is zero because all electrons are paired together in their respective molecular orbits. But for the ionic Ga7As7 cluster with odd number of electrons, the net magnetic moment is 1.0 mu(B) due to an unpaired electron.

The apparent Ag coverage of the total area increases linearly with the nominal film thickness h for h < 0.9nm. However, the coverage exhibits a fluctuation behavior for 1.0nm < h < 2.5nm. It is found that the anomalous behavior of the coverage is resulted from a characteristic material condensation process in the aggregates.

In order to determine whether cucurbitacin B can also enhance the sensitivity of Hep-2 laryngeal cells to cisplatin, we treated Hep-2 cells with either cucurbitacin B, cisplatin, or the combination and evaluated these cells for proliferation, cell cycle distribution, and apoptosis. Our results demonstrate that, in comparison to single agent cucurbitacin B or cisplatin treated cells, Hep-2 cells treated with a cucurbitacin B/cisplatin combination display synergistic effects on growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction. Western blot analysis using protein extracts from Hep-2 cells treated with cucurbitacin B, cisplatin, or the combination largely recapitulated the observations made when treated with the cucurbitacin B/docetaxel combination. More specifically, Hep-2 cell lines treated with the cucurbitacin B/cisplatin combination demonstrated a significantly reduced level of p-Stat3 in comparison with single agent treated cells. In addition, cucurbitacin B/cisplatin treated Hep-2 cells also demonstrated a significant reduction in Bcl-2 and Cyclin B1 protein levels compared to single agent cucurbitacin B or cisplatin treated cells. Xenograft models containing Hep-2 cells in mice also demonstrated that this cucurbitacin B/cisplatin combination led to the synergistic inhibition of tumor growth.

J	Zhang, DX; Shao, LP; Zhou, XL; Martens, S				Zhang, Dexuan; Shao, Liping; Zhou, Xiaolin; Martens, Sander			Differential effects of exogenous and endogenous cueing in multi-stream RSVP: implications for theories of attentional blink	EXPERIMENTAL BRAIN RESEARCH			English	Article						Attentional blink; Endogenous cueing; Exogenous cueing; RSVP	SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION; TIME; SELECTION; PARIETAL; BRAIN; MODEL	We studied whether motor-control constraints for grasping objects that are moved to new positions reflect a rigid constraint hierarchy or a flexible constraint hierarchy. In two experiments, we asked participants to move two plungers from the same start locations to different target locations (both high, both low, or one high and one low). We found that participants grasped the plungers had the same target heights, but these grasp tendencies were reduced when the plungers had different target heights. In addition, when the plungers had different mass distributions, participants behaved in ways that suggested still-different emphases of the relevant grasp constraints. When the plungers had different mass distributions, participants sacrificed bimanual symmetry for end-state comfort. The results suggest that bimanual grasp planning relies on a flexible rather than static hierarchy. Different constraints take on different degrees of importance depending on the nature of the task and on the level of task experience. The results have implications for the understanding of perceptual-motor skill learning. It may be that one mechanism underlying such learning is changing the priorities of task constraints.

The synthesis was based on a key step to promote the dissolution of Fe powder by the addition of Cu or CuO powder in phosphoric acid solution. The improved coprecipitation process could achieve homogeneous mixing of the reactants at the molecular level. The crystalline particle size of the LiFePO4 was between 20 and 70 nm. All the samples were pure single-phase indexed with orthorhombic Pnmb space group. The electrochemical performance of LiFe0.96Mo0.04PO4, including its reversible capacity, cycle number and charge-discharge characteristics, were all better than those of pure LiFePO4.

However, the intracellular pathways that transduce these extrinsic signals remain to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that conditional ablation of the nonreceptor tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in Olig1-expressing oligodendrocyte lineage resulted in dramatic reduction in the generation and proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in the spinal cord. Maturation and myelination of oligodendrocytes were also compromised in the Shp2 mutants. The deficits in oligodendrocyte development in Shp2 mutants nearly phenocopied those observed in PDGF-A mutants, suggesting that Shp2 is a crucial component in transducing PDGF-A signals in the control of oligodendrocyte proliferation and maturation.

Since the Dirac equation is described as a matrix equation, it is necessary to describe the Wigner function as a matrix function in phase space. What's more, this function is then proved to satisfy the Dirac equation with *-product. Finally, by solving the *-product Dirac equation, the energy levels as well as the Wigner functions for a spin-1/2 relativistic particle in the presence of magnetic field are obtained.

The integrated feature set was used to generalize and justify the Chinese-to-English transferring rule of the 'ZHE' aspect (ZHE Rule). A ZHE classification model was built in this study. The impacts of each set of temporal, lexical aspectual, and syntactic features, and their integrated impacts, on the accuracy of the ZHE Rule were tested. Over 600 misclassified corpus sentences were manually examined. A 10-fold cross-validation was used with a decision tree algorithm. The main results are: (1) The ZHE Rule was generalized and justified to have a higher accuracy under the two metrics: the precision rate and the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). (2) The temporal, lexical aspectual, and syntactic feature sets have an integrated contribution to the accuracy of the ZHE Rule. The syntactic and temporal features have an impact on ZHE aspect derivations, while the lexical aspectual features are not predictive of ZHE aspect derivation. (3) While associated with active verbs, the ZHE aspect can denote a perfective situation. This study suggests that the temporal and syntactic features are the predictive ZHE aspect classification features and that the ZHE Rule with an overall precision rate of 80.1% is accurate enough to be further explored in MT practice. The machine learning method, decision tree, can be applied to the automatic aspect transferring in MT research and aspectual interpretations in linguistic research.

These procedures are feasible for treatment of PDA in a child, but are believed to be challenging when employed in an adult. The main danger is intraoperative bleeding. With a hemorrhage, inadvertent ductus damage/perforation during the isolated ductus, the traditional surgical approach was accomplished with considerable difficulty. This study reports a new procedure for these adult patients using an intrapericardial approach to the ductus. The operation was done as an emergency salvage procedure. Based on the results from the 4 cases of PDA, such technique is found to be simple, safe, and effective.

J	Tang, B; Wang, SG; Zhang, F				Tang, Bin; Wang, Shigui; Zhang, Fan			Two storage hexamerins from the beet armyworm Spodoptera exigua: Cloning, characterization and the effect of gene silencing on survival	BMC MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article							MULBERRY LONGICORN BEETLE; ARTHROPOD HEMOCYANINS; LARVAL DEVELOPMENT; MOLECULAR-CLONING; TOBACCO HORNWORM; CAMPONOTUS-FESTINATUS; COMMON CUTWORM; CDNA CLONING; FAT-BODY; PROTEINS	Background: In insects, hemocyanin superfamily proteins accumulate apparently to serve as sources of amino acids during metamorphosis, reproduction and development. Storage hexamerins are important members of the hemocyanin superfamily. Although insects possess storage hexamerins, very little is known about the character and specific functions of hexamerin 1 and storage protein 1 in insect development. Results: To gain insight into the function of storage proteins in insects, cDNAs for two storage proteins were cloned from the fat body of Spodoptera exigua. S. exigua hexamerin 1 (SeHex) cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2124 nucleotides encoding a protein of 707 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 82.12 kDa. S. exigua storage protein 1 (SeSP1) cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2256 bp encoding a protein of 751 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of similar to 88.84 kDa. Northern blotting analyses revealed that SeHex mRNA is expressed in the fat body, cuticle, midgut and Malpighian tubules and SeSP1 in fat body, Malpighian tubules and tracheae. SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs were expressed in fat body at different levels from first instar larvae to pupae, with expression was much lower from first instar larvae to first-day fifth instar larvae. SeHex transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae (pre-pupae) and steadily decreased to the seventh pupal day. SeSP1 transcript expression was high in fat body of wandering larvae, 2-day-old fifth instar larvae and 2-, 4- and 7-day-old pupae. SeHex and SeSP1 mRNAs levels were expressed lower than control on the condition of starvation at 12 h. Of insects injected with SeHex and SeSP1 dsRNA, 38.7% and 24.3% survived to 204 h after treatment, respectively. This was significantly lower than in the controls groups. Conclusions: These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and the function in starvation of storage proteins. RNA interference results revealed that storage protein genes are key in metamorphosis, reproduction and insect development. The results for SeHex and SeSP1 interference reveal that a potential method to control this pest is to disrupt the regulation of storage proteins.

The results indicated that the copolymers have not only a good solubility, thermal stability, and high glass transition temperatures, but also an intense red emission at 612 nm, corresponding to the D-5(0)-> F-7(2) transition of Eu(III) ions under UV excitation. Compared with the Eu-complex monomer, the Eu-copolymers exhibited much higher luminescence lifetimes and efficiencies. Moreover, the luminescence intensities of the copolymers were much higher than those of the Eu-complex/poly(methyl methacrylate) blend system at the same Eu content, and increased nearly linearly with an increase in the Eu content within 5.33 wt.-%, and no significant concentration quenching phenomenon was observed at the Eu content up to 10.72 wt.-%. In the blend system, however, the linear relationship between the luminescence intensity and Eu content was observed within 3.30 wt.-%, and then the blend system showed typical emission concentration quenching on further increase in the Eu content. The improvement of the luminescence properties for the copolymers may be attributed to the special micro-environment, in which the Eu-complex units are uniformly bonded to and surrounded by the polymer chain. These excellent photoluminescence properties may enable the novel copolymers to be used as pure red-emitting materials.

Structural Analysis of Alternative Complex III in the Photosynthetic Electron Transfer Chain of Chloroflexus aurantiacus	BIOCHEMISTRY			English	Article							CYTOCHROME BC; RHODOTHERMUS-MARINUS; EARLY EVOLUTION; BACTERIUM; ELECTROPHORESIS; ORGANISMS; PROTEINS; GEN	The green photosynthetic bacterium Chloroflexus aurantiacus, which belongs to the phylum of filamentous anoxygenic phototrophs, does not contain a cytochrome bc or bf type complex which is found in all other known groups of phototrophs. This suggests that a functional replacement exists to link the reaction center photochemistry to cyclic electron transfer as well as respiration. Earlier work identified a potential substitute of the cytochrome bc complex, now named alternative complex III (ACIII), which has been purified from C. aurantiacus, identified, and characterized. ACIII functions as a menaquinol:auracyanin oxidoreductase in the photosynthetic electron transfer chain, and a related but distinct complex functions in respiratory electron flow to a terminal oxidase. In this work, we focus on elucidating the structure of photosynthetic ACIII. We found that ACIII is an integral membrane protein complex of similar to 300 kDa that consists of eight subunits of seven different types. Among them, there are four metalloprotein subunits, including a 113 kDa iron-sulfur cluster-containing polypeptide, a 25 kDa penta-heme c-containing subunit, and two 20 kDa monoheme c-containing subunits in the form of a homodimer. A variety of analytical techniques were employed in determining the ACIII substructure, including HPLC combined with ESI-MS, metal analysis, potentiometric titration, and intensity analysis of heme staining SDS-PAGE. A preliminary structural model of ACIII is proposed on the basis of the analytical data and chemical cross-linking in tandem with mass analysis using MALDI-TOF, as well as transmembrane and transit peptide analysis.

PHYSICS LETTERS A			English	Article						Heterogeneity; Target waves; Traveling direction; Wave competition; CGLE	GINZBURG-LANDAU EQUATION; REACTION-DIFFUSION SYSTEMS; PATTERNS; PACEMAKERS; MEDIA	Traveling direction (outgoing or ingoing) of target waves sustained by a localized inhomogeneity and their competition rules in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation (CGLE) are studied. We show that even a local positive (negative) frequency shift is capable of creating ingoing (outgoing) target waves. A novel transition between ingoing and outgoing target waves, as we find, can be switched by the size of the inhomogeneity. The competition rules for wave patterns (e.g., target waves) are also studied systematically. All the numerical findings are found to be in perfect agreement with the theoretical criteria that are derived based on the fundamental conceptions (e.g., group velocity, phase velocity).

Applying the exact master equation for nanodevices we recently developed to the more general case in which all the constituents of a device vary in time in response to time-dependent external voltages, we obtained non-perturbatively the transient quantum transport theory in terms of the reduced density matrix. The theory enables us to study transient quantum transport in nanostructures with back-reaction effects from the contacts, with non-Markovian dissipation and decoherence being fully taken into account. For a simple illustration, we apply the theory to a single-electron transistor subjected to ac bias voltages. The non-Markovian memory structure and the nonlinear response functions describing transient electron transport are obtained.

Quantum Fisher information lies at the heart of the estimation task. We employ Ising spin chain in a transverse field as the environment which exhibits a quantum phase transition. Fisher information decays with time almost monotonously when the environment reaches the critical point. By choosing a fixed time or taking the time average, one can see the quantum Fisher information presents a sudden drop at the critical point. Different initial states of the environment are considered. The phenomenon that the quantum Fisher information, namely, the precision of estimation, changes dramatically can be used to detect the quantum criticality of the environment. We also introduce a general method to obtain the maximal Fisher information for a given state.

In this proposal, the two lowest levels of each SQUID serve as the logical states and two intermediate levels of each SQUID are used for the gate realization. We show that neither adjustment of SQUID level spacings during the gate operation nor uniformity in SQUID parameters is required by this proposal. In addition, this proposal does not require the adiabatic passage or a second-order detuning and thus the gate is much faster.

How the xCT triggers the signal transduction of HHV-8 infection and the cell proliferation remains incomplete. We found that xCT was overexpressed in KS tissues and HHV-8-positive BCBL-1 cells. When xCT cDNA plasmids were transfected into the HHV-8-negative BJAB cells, the expression of 14-3-3 beta and cell growth rate were increased. In contrast, the expression of 14-3-3 beta and the cell growth rate of HHV-8-positive BCBL-1 cells were suppressed by either xCT siRNA (short interfering RNA) or an xCT inhibitor, sulfsalazine. These results suggest that 14-3-3 beta is a downstream effector of xCT in KS to mediate the cell proliferation.

The crude extracts of the CT26 cells treated with heat and Trichosanthin were precipitated with salt and dialyzed to remove proteins below 50 kDa and above 300 kDa in molecular weight; the proteins with the molecular weights in 70 kDa, 90 kDa, 95 kDa. 110 kDa and 170 kDa were collected through gel filtration and SDS-PAGE After confirmation, the purified proteins were used to determine their effects on lymphocyte proliferation, the activities of NK and CTL, tumor suppression and the tumor-bearing mouse survival Results The majority of the chaperone-peptides of anti-cancer immunity in CT26 cells, including HSP70-antigen peptide, HSP90-antigen peptide, gp96-antigen peptide, HSP-110 antigen peptide, HSP170-antigen peptide, was satisfactorily extracted that the multi-chaperone-peptide-rich mixtures were obtained. All the mixtures prepared could elicit lymphocyte proliferation, enhance the activities of CTL and INK reinforce the tumor suppression and prolong the mouse survival Conclusions The multi-chaperone-peptide-rich mixtures could be prepared via dialysis and gel filtration combining with SDS-PAGE Both the heat stress and Trichosanthin could induce and increase the mixtures, of which that treated by 42 degrees C heat and Trichosanthin was found to possess the strongest anti-cancer efficacy (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved	[Huang, Changxin; Zhao, Jiangang; Li, Zhaoyang] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xia, Dajing; Wang, Qingqing] Zhejiang Univ, Inst Immunol, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Da; Jin, Hongchuan] Zhejiang Univ, Sir Run Run Shaw Hosp, Dept Med Oncol, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Huang, CX (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Sch Med, Affiliated Hosp, 126 Wenzhou Rd, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

We experimentally investigated whether embryos can facultatively adjust cardiac function to cope with such challenges by imposing regional hypoxia on developing eggs of the scincid lizard Bassiana duperreyi. To do so, we sealed half of the eggshell surface with tissue adhesive. The embryos rapidly responded by increasing heart rates, which they maintained for long periods. The elevated heart rates enabled the embryos not only to survive, but to maintain "normal" metabolic rates, and to hatch at the usual time with unmodified phenotypic traits (e.g., hatchling size, relative heart mass, locomotor speed, post-hatchling survival and growth rates). Turtles and birds with rigid (highly calcified) eggshells show more dramatic ill-effects from hypoxic incubation, suggesting that the thin (and thus, highly gas-permeable) parchment-shelled eggs of most squamates allow more effective embryonic adjustment of oxygen exchange rates in response to externally-imposed hypoxia.

Depending on the initial conditions, the circular interface could select different wave patterns: concentric and spiral waves. Unlike the previously found targets or spirals, we found that the source of these interface selected waves is located at the circular interface instead of the center such as the "pacemaker" or spiral core; the coexistence of the opposite phase velocities in the same wave pattern is observed. What is more, the frequencies (or wave numbers) are identical in two domains with totally different control parameters, and it looks as if the interface selected waves propagate in a homogeneous medium without experiencing any difference across the interface. For the interface selected spiral pattern, we argue that its formation was attributed to the wave competition and topological constraints.

To assess the genetic diversity within L.. reevesii, and its population structure and evolutionary history, we sequenced 1004 bp of cytochrome b for 448 individuals collected from 28 localities covering almost the whole range of the lizard. One hundred and forty variable sites were observed, and 93 haplotypes were defined. We identified three genetically distinct clades, of which Clade A includes haplotypes mainly from southeastern Hainan, Clade B from Guangdong and northern Hainan, and Clade C from Vietnam and the other localities of China. Clade A was well distinguished and divergent from the other two. The Wuzhishan and Yinggeling mountain ranges were important barriers limiting gene exchange between populations on the both sides of the mountain series, whereas the Gulf of Tonkin and the Qiongzhou Strait were not. One plausible scenario to explain our genetic data is a historical dispersion of C reevesii as proceeding from Vietnam to Hainan, followed by a second wave of dispersal from Hainan to Guangdong and Guangxi. Another equally plausible scenario is a historically widespread population that has been structured by vicariant factors such as the mountains in Hainan and sea level fluctuations.

The thermal degradation of the polycarbonate (PC)/polyborosiloxane blend was investigated by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The polyborosiloxane with linear Si-O chain and phenyl/methyl side group possesses the best flame retardancy. By adding 5 wt% of the polyborosiloxane to PC, the LOI (Limited Oxygen Index) of the PC increase from 26% to 41%. It is found that the addition of the polyborosiloxane can promote the formation of char during the PC blend combustion. Nevertheless, the change of the LOI value of the PC/polyborosiloxane blends is inconsistent with the change of the amount of their thermal degradation residues. The sample with the highest solid residue does not necessarily give the highest LOI.

The burning behavior of PC/polysiloxane and the structure of the combustion char were analyzed. The results show that phenyl content has much influence on the flame retardancy of the polysiloxane. The flame retardancy of polysiloxane with 75% phenyl is the best. The branched polysiloxane has higher flame retardancy than the linear one. Comparing the combustion behaviors of the PC and the PC/polysiloxane blend, it is found that the char of the PC/polysiloxane blend formed during the combustion was more compact and uniform. The char acts as a good insulating barrier, which reduces radiant heat of the flame and suppresses the thermal degradation of the polymers; therefore the flame retardancy of PC/polysioxane increases.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL; Ni, J				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli; Ni, Jun			Structural, Electronic, and Magnetic Properties of Defects in the BC3 Sheet from First Principles	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							WALLED CARBON NANOTUBES; CHEMICAL SENSOR; GRAPHENE	Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the structures and properties of vacancy and antisite defects in the BC3 sheet. We find that the BC3 sheets with defects show rich electronic and magnetic properties. The vacancies and antisites can cause semiconductor-metal transitions in the BC3 sheet. The magnetism can be induced by mono- and diantisites and divacancies. Formation energies show that antisite defects are more likely formed than vacancy ones in the BC3 sheet. Under suitable chemical potential conditions, the BC3 sheet with defects can become a stable magnetic metal, magnetic semiconductor, and nonmagnetic semiconductor. Our studies demonstrate that the electronic and magnetic properties of the BC3 sheet can be tailored by a defect engineering, which leads to potential applications in the nanoscale electronics and spintronics.

In the glass microchip, amorphous selenium(a-Se) colloid was prepared by reducing selenious acid with an excess amount of hydrazine at a temperature of 100 C. In the coupled PMMA microchip, a-Se was transformed into more stable t-Se seeds via sonication at room temperature. The residence time of the reactants in both microchips was optimized by varying the dimension and length of the microchannel each. The t-Se nanowires were formed by anisotropic growth of selenium crystallite during sonication and aging under the assistance of beta-cyclodextrin(beta-CD). Various stages of the nanowires' growth were investigated. The as-synthesized products were characterized by powder X-Ray diffraction(XRD), Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy(SEM), transmission electron microscopy(TEM) and selected-area electron diffraction(SAED).

However, it is not clear whether or not working memory processing can influence the early stages of oculomotor capture by abrupt onsets. Here we present clear evidence for an early modulation driven by stimulus matches to the contents of working memory in the colour dimension. Interestingly, verbal as well as visual information in working memory influenced the direction of the fastest saccades made in search, saccadic latencies and the curvature of the scan paths made to the search target. This pattern of results arose even though the contents of working memory were detrimental for search, demonstrating an early, automatic top-down mediation of oculomotor onset capture by the contents of working memory.

J	Pan, Y; Soto, D				Pan, Yi; Soto, David			The modulation of perceptual selection by working memory is dependent on the focus of spatial attention	VISION RESEARCH			English	Article						Working memory; Attentional capture; Attentional focus; Spatial pre-cueing; Automaticity	INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; GUIDED VISUAL-SEARCH; NEURAL MECHANISMS; AUTOMATIC GUIDANCE; CAPTURE; DEPLOYMENT; RESPONSES; NEURONS; ONSETS; MIND	Recent research suggests that visual selection can be automatically biased to those stimuli matching the contents of working memory (WM). However, a complete functional account of the interplay between WM and attention remains to be established. In particular, the boundary conditions of the WM effect on selection are unclear. Here, the authors investigate the influence of the focus of spatial attention (i.e., diffused vs. focused) by assessing the effect of spatial precues on attentional capture by WM. Experiments 1 and 2 showed that relative to a neutral condition without memory-matching stimuli, the presence of a memory distractor can trigger attentional capture despite being entirely irrelevant for the attention task but this happened only when the item was actively maintained in WM and not when it was merely repeated. Experiments 3a, 3b and 3c showed that attentional capture by WM can be modulated by endogenous spatial pre-cueing of the incoming target of selection. The authors conclude that WM-driven capture of visual selection is dependent on the focus of spatial attention. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We investigated the influence of temperatures on incubation period, hatching success and hatchling traits to indentify the optimal temperatures for egg incubation in two Geoemydid turtles (Ocadia sinensis and Mauremys mutica). Incubation period of O. sinensis eggs was shorter than that of M. mutica eggs. In both species, hatching success was high in the temperature range of 26-30 degrees C, and hatchlings were mainly males if incubated at low temperatures and females at high temperatures. The pivotal temperature for sex determination fell into the range of 28-30 degrees C for O. sinensis and 26-28 degrees C for M. mutica. Incubation temperature profoundly affected post-hatching growth in M. mutica, but not in O. sinensis. Hatchling M. mutica from 24 and 26 degrees C grew faster than those from 28 and 30 degrees C. Therefore, temperatures around 26 or 28 degrees C would be optimal incubation temperatures for M. mutica or O. sinensis to improve hatching success and post-hatching growth, and to yield offspring with a balanced sex ratio. Moreover, this study demonstrates significant inter- and intra-specific variations in optimal incubation temperature and pivotal temperature, which implies that simply adopting incubation regimes developed for other species or populations should be avoided in turtle aquaculture.

Though AtHsp90.3 supported the yeast growth under heat stress, in Arabidopsis, compared to the wild type, the transgenic plants overexpressing cytosolic AtHsp90.3 were more sensitive to heat stress with a lower germination rate and higher mortality but and more tolerant to high Ca2+. Transcriptional expression of heat stress transcription factors, AtHsfA1d, AtHsfA7a and AtHsfB1, and two Hsps, AtHsp101 and AtHsp17, was delayed by constitutive overexpression of cytosolic AtHsp90.3 under heat stress. These results indicate that overexpressing AtHsp90.3 impaired plant tolerance to heat stress and proper homeostasis of Hsp90 was critical for cellular stress response and/or tolerance in plants.

The significant difference was found between the two parents and among DH population lines, with lines 117, 101 and parent ZYQ8 showing the high Cr tolerance, lines 41 and 49 showing Cr sensitivity. A dramatic difference also existed in Cr accumulation of plant tissues, with lines 19, 18 and 1, 5 having the minimum and maximum shoot Cr accumulation, respectively, and line 19, parent JX17 and lines 1, 56, ZYQ8 having the minimum and maximum root Cr accumulation, respectively. There was a significant difference in shoot/root ratio of Cr accumulation among the population, with line 18 and parent ZYQ8 ranking the tops and lines 109, 71, 19, parent JX17 ranking the bottoms. Zn uptake and accumulation was reduced when the plants were exposed to Cr stress. In addition, three QTLs were detected, which are, respectively, associated with Cr accumulation in shoot and root, and ratio of shoot to root.

In order to study the trehalose synthesis pathway, a cDNA for a trehalose-6-phosphate synthase from Spodoptera exigua (SeTPS) was cloned which contained an open reading frame of 2481 nucleotides encoding a protein of 826 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 92.65 kDa. The SeTPS genome has 12 exons and 11 introns. Northern blot and RT-PCR analyses showed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body and in the ovary. Competitive RT-PCR revealed that SeTPS mRNA was expressed in the fat body at different developmental stages and was present at a high level in day 1 S. exigua pupae. The concentrations of trehalose and glucose in the hemolymph were determined by HPLC and showed that they varied at different developmental stages and were negatively correlated to each other. The survival rates of the insects injected with dsRNA corresponding to SeTPS gene reached 53.95%, 49.06%, 34.86% and 33.24% for 36, 48, 60 and 204 h post-injection respectively which were significantly lower than those of the insects in three control groups. These findings provide new data on the tissue distribution, expression patterns and potential function of the trehalose-6-phosphate synthase gene. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Incorporating 10 wt% PP-g-MA only enhanced the mechanical and thermal properties to some extent, but did not improve the flame retardancy of WPC. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) showed that the thermal stability of WPC was further increased with the addition of CNTs or CNT-OH and the increase of their loading level. Cone calorimeter measurements suggested that CNTs and CNT-OH could effectively reduce the peak heat release rate (PHRR) of WPC, and the flame retardancy properties reached the optimum value when both of their loading was 1.0 wt%, for instance, a reduction in PHRR by 16.7% and 25% for CNTs and CNT-OH, respectively. In addition, CNT-OH conferred better flame retardancy on WPC relative to pristine CNTs due to the better interfacial adhesion with wood flour and PP matrix, which was evidenced by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observations.

In this study, to determine whether exogenous GABA is functional in alleviating oxidative stress induced by H+ and Al3+ toxicities, the antioxidant defence response regulated by GABA was investigated in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). RESULTS: After 24 h treatments of seedlings under H+, Al3+ and combined stresses with and without GABA, morphological and biochemical assays were conducted. It was observed that the inhibition of seedling root elongation caused by Al3+ and H+ toxicities was significantly mitigated by GABA. The amount of carbonylated proteins with molecular masses of 14.4-97 kDa was decreased. The activities of antioxidant enzymes were enhanced, the content of malondialdehyde was reduced and the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), as shown by staining roots with nitroblue tetrazolium, declined in GABA-treated seedlings. CONCLUSION: GABA can alleviate oxidative damage caused by H+ and Al3+ toxicities in barley seedlings by activating antioxidant defence responses and reducing the elevated levels of carbonylated proteins caused by ROS.

Here, we quantified the copy numbers of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in the gametic cells of angiosperm species. We demonstrate that each egg cell from Arabidopsis thaliana, Antirrhinum majus, and Nicotiana tabacum possesses 59.0, 42.7, and 73.0 copies of mtDNA on average, respectively. These values are equivalent to those in Arabidopsis mesophyll cells, at 61.7 copies per cell. On the other hand, sperm or generative cells from Arabidopsis, A. majus, and N. tabacum possess minor amounts of mtDNA, at 0.083, 0.47, and 1 copy on average, respectively. We further reveal a 50-fold degradation of mtDNA during pollen development in A. majus. In contrast, markedly high levels of mtDNA are found in the male gametic cells of Cucumis melo and Pelargonium zonale (1296.3 and 256.7 copies, respectively). Our results provide direct evidence for mitochondrial genomic insufficiency in the eggs and somatic cells and indicate that a male gamete of an angiosperm may possess mtDNA at concentrations as high as 21-fold (C. melo) or as low as 0.1% (Arabidopsis) of the levels in somatic cells. These observations reveal the existence of a strong regulatory system for the male gametic mtDNA levels in angiosperms with regard to mitochondrial inheritance.

Dimensionality-driven spin-flop transition in quasi-one-dimensional PrBa2Cu4O8	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; LOW-TEMPERATURE; NORMAL-STATE; YBA2CU4O8; TRANSPORT; PR; MAGNETORESISTANCE; CROSSOVER; CHAINS; PHASE	In the quasi-one-dimensional cuprate PrBa2Cu4O8, the Pr cations order antiferromagnetically at 17 K in zero field. Through a combination of magnetic susceptibility, torque magnetometry, specific heat, and interchain transport measurements, the anisotropic temperature-magnetic-field phase diagram associated with this ordering has been mapped out. A low-temperature spin-flop transition in the Pr sublattice is found to occur at the same magnetic field strength and orientation as a dimensional crossover in the ground state of the metallic-CuO chains. This coincidence suggests that the spin reorientation is driven by a change in the anisotropic Rudermann-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction induced by a corresponding change in effective dimensionality of the conduction electrons.

J	Zhang, LQ; Xu, Z; Li, HR; Noda, I				Zhang, Liqun; Xu, Zheng; Li, Haoran; Noda, Isao			The relative error caused by reproducibility in two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	5th International Symposium on Two Dimensional Correlation Spectroscopy	AUG 05-07, 2009	Wroclaw, POLAND			Two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy; Error analysis; Reproducibility; Noise level	CORRELATION SPECTRA; NOISE	Reproducibility is a very important issue for the construction and interpretation of two-dimensional (2D) correlation spectra. This paper introduced the way to estimate the relative error in 2D correlation spectroscopy, especially focused on the possible source of errors that may arise from the limitation of experimental reproducibility. Mainly two sources of reproducibility are examined. The first is the reproducibility of the performance of experimental apparatus, in which the baseline drift as well as the noise level of spectroscopic measurements are taken into consideration. The maximum intensities of the 2D correlation maps obtained by the measurement of a series of small fluctuations of baselines are typically only in the order of 10(-5) and 10(-7), respectively, for synchronous or asynchronous spectra, which are so small that their effect can be safely ignored. Meanwhile, the 2D correlation maps based purely on the experimental noise can also be constructed, which provides the threshold above which any correlation can be treated as meaningful. The second source of relative error is caused by the reproducibility of the experimental condition. The most commonly used perturbations for generalized 2D correlation spectroscopy are concentration and temperature. Therefore, the effect of the reproducibility of the concentration of each sample prepared, as well as the small variation of the temperature during the measurement, which may all give rise to relative error, was examined. A quantitative measure of the extent of relative error caused by this kind of reproducibility can also be analyzed by using 2D correlation maps. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One fundamental question in developmental neurobiology is what signals or factors control the developmental switch from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Here we report that microRNAs (miRNAs) play an essential role in this important developmental process. Inhibition of miRNA formation in Olig1 (Cre)-mediated Dicer conditional knock-out mice disrupted both oligodendrogenesis and astrogliogenesis in the ventral neuroepithelial cells. By contrast, the early patterning and development of motor neurons were not affected in the mutant spinal cord tissue.

While the impurity spin is quenched by conduction electrons, the spin-spin correlation of the conduction electron and impurity is strongly anisotropic in both spin and spatial spaces. As a result of strong spin-orbit coupling, the out-of-plane component of the impurity spin is found to be fully screened by the orbital angular momentum of the conduction electrons.

Effects of kind and content of alcohol molecules on the relative activity of the immobilized enzyme and the characteristics of the immobilized enzyme were examined carefully. The maximum relative activities of the immobilized lipase quenched with methanol and n-propanol, were 224.3 and 224.5%, respectively, both 1.96 fold of the just immobilized lipase which was not quenched with alcohol. Residual activity of the immobilized lipase using methanol to quench the excessive activated groups on support surface was 65.9% after heating at 50 C for 60 h, 1.29 folds higher than that of the ordinarily immobilized lipase (with no blockage). Alcohol molecules could alter the physical and chemical properties to modulate the microenvironment on support surface by changing the hydrophobicity. Suitable microenvironment, resulted from the methanol quenching the excessive active groups, would further favor the activity and the stability of lipase at higher temperature.

The present study tried to replicate the effect of WM-based attentional capture using an adaption of Downing's (2000) paradigm, in which WM and attentional capture were combined. Subjects were presented with an attention display containing two objects, one of which could be precued by a matching item being held in WM. As measured by a probe discrimination task, the memory-matching object had a privileged status to capture attention regardless of the stimulus onset asynchronies between the memory cue and the attention display, even when there was absolutely no benefit for subjects to bias attention in favour of the memory match. These results suggest that WM contents guide attention in an involuntary manner. The implications of current findings for understanding of WM effects on visual selection are discussed.

The method proposed combined of the preparation of silica-based monolithic column with organic polymer-based monolithic column. A technique introducing sol mixture into capillary by suction mercury was carried out to obtain a flat and orderly interface of stationary phase. The influences of running voltage, organic additive, concentration and pH of buffer on electroosmotic flow(EOF) were investigated respectively. The structure and pore size distribution of the monolithic material were characterized by scanning electronmicroscopy and nitrogen adsorption method. The pore size distribution profile of mesopores of the material was around 3 - 7 nm with average specific surface area of material was 103.4 M-2/g. Chromatographic characteristics of the monolithic column prepared with the optimized fabrication condition were studied. Seven neutral hydrocarbon, such as alkylbenzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), were baselinely separated using the mixture based monolithic column. For naphthalene, the separation efficiency of 54000 theoretical plates/m was achieved, the RSD values of retention times and capacity factor were 0.9% and 0.6% for five consecutive runs, 1.2% and 0.8% for day-to-day(n = 3), 8.7% and 5.7% for column-to-column(n = 3), respectively.

J	Webb, JK; Du, WG; Pike, D; Shine, R				Webb, Jonathan K.; Du, Weiguo; Pike, David; Shine, Richard			Generalization of predator recognition: Velvet geckos display anti-predator behaviours in response to chemicals from non-dangerous elapid snakes	CURRENT ZOOLOGY			English	Article						Predation risk; Chemical cues; Lizard; Elapidae; Gekkonidae; Olfaction; Multipredator	TAIL AUTOTOMY; PREY; RISK; CUES; LIZARD; PERSPECTIVES; PROSPECTUS; HYPOTHESIS; ECOLOGY; SCENT	Many prey species detect chemical cues from predators and modify their behaviours in ways that reduce their risk of predation. Theory predicts that prey should modify their anti-predator responses according to the degree of threat posed by the predator. That is, prey should show the strongest responses to chemicals of highly dangerous prey, but should ignore or respond weakly to chemicals from non-dangerous predators. However, if anti-predator behaviours are not costly, and predators are rarely encountered, prey may exhibit generalised antipredator behaviours to dangerous and non-dangerous predators. In Australia, most elapid snakes eat lizards, and are therefore potentially dangerous to lizard prey. Recently, we found that the nocturnal velvet gecko Oedura lesueurii responds to chemicals from dangerous and non-dangerous elapid snakes, suggesting that it displays generalised anti-predator behaviours to chemicals from elapid snakes. To explore the generality of this result, we videotaped the behaviour of velvet geckos in the presence of chemical cues from two small elapid snakes that rarely consume geckos: the nocturnal golden-crowned snake Cacophis squamulosus and the diurnal marsh snake Hemiaspis signata. We also videotaped geckos in trials involving unscented cards (controls) and cologne-scented cards (pungency controls). In trials involving Cacophis and Hemiaspis chemicals, 50% and 63% of geckos spent long time periods (> 3 min) freezing whilst pressed flat against the substrate, respectively. Over half the geckos tested exhibited anti-predator behaviours (tail waving, tail vibration, running) in response to Cacophis (67%) or Hemiaspis (63%) chemicals. These behaviours were not observed in control or pungency control trials. Our results support the idea that the velvet gecko displays generalised anti-predator responses to chemical cues from elapid snakes. Generalised responses to predator chemicals may be common in prey species that co-occur with multiple, ecologically similar, dangerous predators [Current Zoology 56(3): 337-342, 2010].

This system differs from the classical CRM for retaining and targeting profitable customers; the main focus of the proposed SVM-based ensemble learning system is to identify high-risk customers in CRM for avoiding possible loss. To build an effective SVM-based ensemble learning system, the effects of ensemble members' diversity, ensemble member selection and different ensemble strategies on the performance of the proposed SVM-based ensemble learning system are each investigated in a practical CRM case. Through experimental analysis, we find that the Bayesian-based SVM ensemble learning system with diverse components and choose from space selection strategy show the best performance over various testing samples.

Development of community nursing in Zhejiang Province, China: a report of the driving measures	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Administration; China; Community Nursing; Education; Primary Health Care; Regulation		Background: Community nursing is playing an important role in health care worldwide. Methods: We reviewed recent developments in community nursing in the Zhejiang province of China and reported that the locally tailored practical guidelines, education programmes and management models are the driving measures for promoting local community nursing. Results: In 2008, Zhejiang had 1200 community primary health-care service centres, an increase of 56% and 6789 service stations, a twofold increase, compared with 2004. At present, 27 000 community nurses, together with the same number of family doctors, are working in community health-care service centres and stations. Community nursing in Zhejiang has grown not only by numbers but also by the greatly improved infrastructures and functions of its community primary health care. Conclusion: It is the multi-pronged approach that has led to the change being successful in a local health-care system.

XRD results showed that the modified catalyst Ca-DMC containing 0.14 wt.-% CaCl2 was amorphous. A higher polymer yield (>61 kg polymer/g catalyst) and a shorter induction period for ROP of PO were observed for Ca-DMC than for unmodified DMC catalysts. An initiator had an inhibitory effect on the initiation and polymerization rate of PO ROP. As the molar ratio of the initiator functionality to the catalyst was increased, the reaction rate and polymer yield decreased, whereas the induction period increased. An increase in reaction temperature tended to reduce the polymer yield and broaden the MWD. The C-13 NMR spectrum for an oligomer from a model polymerization without an initiator revealed that the main terminal unit of the polymer was -CH2CH(CH3)OH because H2O in the system participated in reaction initiation. Cl- and t-BuOH may also initiate the reaction according to the small amounts of terminal -CH2Cl and -OC(CH3)(3) units observed by C-13 NMR spectroscopy. On the basis of common characteristics and some new evidence for DMC catalysis, a mechanism similar to a classical coordination insertion process is proposed.

Daily Changes of Infections by Pythium ultimum After a Nutrient Impulse in Organic Versus Conventional Soils	PHYTOPATHOLOGY			English	Article							DAMPING-OFF; BACTERIAL-POPULATIONS; ROOT-ROT; BIOLOGICAL INDICATORS; MICROBIAL COMMUNITIES; SUPPRESSIVENESS; DISEASE; COMPOST; HEALTH; DIVERSITY	Bacterial populations (CFU) have been shown to oscillate in wavelike patterns after nutrient impulses in previous studies. The amplitudes and periods of oscillations could possibly be used as indicators of soil health analogous to the stability and resilience of biological populations widely accepted as indicators for ecosystem health. Limited plant and animal disease outbreaks can also be viewed as a manifestation of a healthy soil ecosystem. Two pot experiments were carried out to verify whether damping-off of beet seedlings by Pythium ultimum, measured as area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC), fluctuated over time after incorporation of organic materials into organic versus conventional soils, and to investigate whether daily dynamics of AUDPCs were linked to the dynamics of microbial populations and chemical parameters. AUDPCs oscillated significantly over time when Pythium bioassays were initiated daily after addition of ground grass and clover shoots (GC) into unplanted soils. Similar oscillations with significant harmonics of AUDPC were also observed in composted manure (CM)-amended soils but with smaller amplitudes than in GC-amended soils. The AUDPC harmonics in amended soils had periods similar to those of CPU of copiotrophic bacteria. Cross-correlation analysis demonstrated that periodic fluctuations of P. ultimum infections (AUDPCs) did not coincide with those of copiotrophic CPU but were shifted in phase. It appears that competition or antagonism from some fast-growing bacteria influenced pathogen infections, because these bacterial populations were growing and dying. Soil chemical variables, including pH, dissolved organic carbon, and NO3--N, and NH4+-N contents, changed significantly in the initial 7 days after a nutrient impulse into soils. These changes were cross-correlated With copiotrophic CPU with time lags of 1 to 2 days but were seldom associated with daily changes in AUDPCs. Organically managed soils always had lower AUDPC ratios of amended to nonamended treatments. indicating that organic materials showed stronger suppressive abilities to P. ultimum in organic than in conventional soils. The oscillations in AUDPCs and copiotrophic CPU in amended organic soil also had smaller amplitudes than in amended conventional soil. These results suggested that organically managed soils had a greater resistance and resilience to the disturbance of the amendments and, therefore, could be considered healthier than conventionally managed soils.

They are novel functional materials with many excellent and special properties, such as high surface area, ordered pore channel, sharp pore size distributions, and so on. In this paper, the main advances in the research of PMOs in recent years are reviewed. The structural characteristics are particularly introduced. Then according to the different organic bridging groups incorporated into the structures, the PMOs are classified into three classes. The synthesis of PMOs with different templates is introduced and the exterior factors which influence the properties are discussed. At last, the difficulties of research on PMOs are mentioned, and the development prospect is looked forward.

The determination basis for this technique from the physiological point of view is also discussed based on the experimental results, which indicated that the glucose measured by the FT-Mid-IR-ATR instrument is from the secretions on the skin and glucose components within the body. The secreted glucose components will increase with the time increasing. The authors' previous study([3-8]) demonstrated 1 120 cm(-1) band as an index to characterize the blood glucose. During the experiments, the authors used the band of 1 455 cm(-1) as internal standard because of its stability, and because the relative intensity of I-1 (120)/I-1 (455) band possesses the higher sensitivity. Meanwhile, from the spectra, the relative intensity of I-1 120/I-1 455 band of the glucose in both sources exhibits a linear relationship with blood glucose concentration within the body. The dried blood has the similar spectra as fingers'. The fingers' spectra will exhibit higher sensitivity if the time of measurement is longer after washing hand, and the results showed that when measured 10 minutes after washing hand, the sensitivity will be higher than that when measured 4 minutes after washing hand. All the results can be used in promoting a convenient, rapid and noninvasive way to monitor the continuous variation of blood glucose concentration of diabetes patients in real time.

We find the fully fluorinated ZnO sheet prefers a twist-chair conformation, which is a nonmagnetic semiconductor. While for the semifluorinated sheet, the F-center conformation is the most stable and exhibits half-metallic behavior. The half-metallicity is attributed to the decrease in the charge transfer from Zn to O atoms after fluorination, which leads to the partial occupancy of the O 2p orbitals and spin-polarization in the semifluorinated sheet.

However, their practical applications are often strongly limited due to low solubility and stability in hydrophilic media. Biocatalysis and biotransformation of flavonoids have been introduced to modify their structure and increase natural flavonoid diversity, which could alter physicochemical properties and improve the bioavailability and biological properties of maternal compounds. In this paper, biocatalytic structural modification of flavonoids by different kinds of enzymes or microorganism, the process and possible mechanism were discussed. The main achievements and key factors affecting biocatalysis of flavonoids were discussed and the research prospect was outlined.

Analysis of the sequence of gene revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 672 base pairs encoding 237 amino acids predicted to yield a protein of molecular mass 26.4 kDa. The encoded protein was overexpressed in E. coli and purified to apparent homogeneity. The enzyme activity is optimal at pH 5.5 and 80 degrees C. For 2-deoxyribose-5-phosphate, the apparent K-m was calculated to be 0.15 +/- 0.01 mM. The recombinant protein was heat stable; no activity loss was observed even after incubation at 90 degrees C for 10 min. In addition, the thermophilic enzyme also showed a remarkable resistance to acetaldehyde; it retained more than 70% activity after exposure for 8 h to 300 mM acetaldehyde at 25 degrees C.

I. Acid Red 73 with H2O2. The result indicated that the COD removal and discoloration of C. I. Acid Red 73 made 55 and 95% respectively in the presence of CoTSPc@chitosan with H2O2 in 4h. In addition, CoTSPc@chitosan-H2O2 system could proceed efficiently in a relatively wide pH range and remain high catalytic activity after 6 reuse cycles. Furthermore, the adsorption study of CoTSPc@chitosan confirmed that chitosan was an outstanding support which contributed a lot to the removal reaction. In conclusion, the combination of adsorption process and catalytic oxidation made the CoTSPc@chitosan-H2O2 system achieve a simple, efficiently and environmentally friendly water treatment.

J	Cao, C; Wu, M; Jiang, JZ; Cheng, HP				Cao, Chao; Wu, Min; Jiang, Jianzhong; Cheng, Hai-Ping			Transition metal adatom and dimer adsorbed on graphene: Induced magnetization and electronic structures	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							GAS MOLECULES; GRAPHITE; NANORIBBONS; MAGNETISM; FIELD	Geometries, electronic structures, and magnetic properties of transition metal M adatom and dimer adsorbed graphene have been studied (M=Fe, Co, Ni, and Cu). With adatom adsorption, we confirm the previously reported stable adsorption site, and the adatoms are chemically bonded with graphene except the copper adatom. With dimer adsorption, we observed that the stable configurations are dependent on the exchange-correlation functional for the iron dimer and nickel dimer; while the stable configurations do not depend on the functional for the cobalt and copper dimer. The adsorption energy indicates the copper dimer can barrierlessly diffuse along the graphene C-C bonds. With iron or cobalt adatom adsorption, graphene becomes a half-metal which can be used as a spin-filtering material. The iron dimer adsorbed graphene is also a half-metal, but the cobalt dimer adsorbed graphene is not. Both local-density approximation and generalized gradient approximation yield consistent results for the nickel adatom adsorbed graphene, which is the system is semiconducting and nonmagnetic due to the strong binding between nickel and graphene. However, different exchange-correlation functionals lead to controversial results for the magnetic and transport properties of nickel dimer adsorbed graphene. The copper adatom adsorbed on graphene exhibits 1 mu(B) local magnetic moment, but the dimer does not show any magnetism. These results show that graphene properties can be effectively modulated by transition metal adsorption and that the transition metal adsorbed graphene can serve as potential materials in nanoelectronics, spintronics, or electrochemistry.

We find that the fluorination is a practical route to induce half-metallicity in ZBNNRs. When the boron edge is two-fluorine terminated and the nitrogen edge is one-fluorine terminated, the ZBNNRs are stable and become robust half metals regardless of the ribbon width. Our studies demonstrate that these fluorinated ZBNNRs have 100% spin transport polarization around the Fermi level, which leads to promising applications in spintronics and nanodevices.

The results suggested that the lower content of organoclay (0.1%,) added to the PP matrix increased the crystallinity and mechanical property (tensile strength) of the PP/organoclay nanocomposite fiber. With increasing the content of organoclay (>= 0.3%), the crystallinity and the tensile strength both a little decreased, and the fiber containing organoclay exhibited multi-peaks at the same draw ratio during the heating process. Furthermore, the degree of orientation of the fiber increased a little with lower content of organoclay (0.1%) introduction to PP during the infrared dichroism measurement.

This reflects our scanty knowledge in this field though curiosity is widely recognised as one of the most important factors that contribute to motivation and effectiveness in education and scientific discovery. Lack of understanding in curiosity may be due partly to limitation of research methodology and technology. This paper suggests using Google Trends as a tool for the study of curiosity and its measurement. The observation based on this tool discusses external stimuli, accessible resource and surprisingness that are closely related to curiosity.

The voltammetric wave of Cd(II) and Zn(II) was effectively suppressed in the presence of Fulvic acid in excess. Significant acceleration of the recovery of the Cd(II) and Zn(II) signal after UV irradiation was observed, and complete recovery of the Cd(ll) and Zn(II) signal was achieved after a photoreaction time of 96 s in the photoca-talytic microreactor.

By detailed calculation we find that the Dirac equation of the relativistic particle in a magnetic field in noncommutative space has similar behaviour to what happens in the Landau problem in commutative space even if an exact map does not exist. By solving the Dirac equation in NC phase space, we not only obtain the energy level of the spin-1/2 relativistic particle in a magnetic field in NC phase space but also explicitly offer some additional terms related to the momentum-momentum non-commutativity.

The results of a survey of 4600 women in nineteen Chinese provinces in 2005 indicated that young age, high income, high education level, urban location and good employment all decreased a woman's willingness to bear children. The risks created by declining fertility in these groups have been intensified by China's 'one child' family planning policy. However, as a result of current trends and China's policies, the country's population will continue to age, leading to social problems and difficulties for sustainable development both in China and around the world. Therefore, China's policy-makers must begin planning to adjust their policy by encouraging women to give birth to more than one child.

TLR4 Is a Negative Regulator in Noninfectious Lung Inflammation	JOURNAL OF IMMUNOLOGY			English	Article							TOLL-LIKE RECEPTORS; RESPIRATORY-DISTRESS-SYNDROME; PULMONARY INFLAMMATION; HYALURONIC-ACID; PATHOGEN RECOGNITION; SIGNALING PATHWAY; DANGER SIGNAL; INJURY; INTERLEUKIN-1; GENE	Low m.w. hyaluronan (LMW HA) has been shown to elicit the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in various cells in vitro. However, the effects of this molecule in vivo are unknown. In this study, we report that intratracheal administration of LMW HA (200 kDa) causes inflammation in mouse lung. A lack of TLR4 is associated with even stronger inflammatory response in the lung as shown by increased neutrophil counts and elevated cytokine and chemokine concentrations. We also demonstrate that TLR4 anti-inflammatory signaling is dependent upon a MyD88-independent pathway. TLR4-mediated IL-1R antagonist production plays a negative regulatory role in LMW HA (200 kDa) induced lung inflammation. These data provide a molecular level explanation for the function of TLR4 in LMW HA (200 kDa)-induced lung inflammation, as inhibition of the 13 form of pro IL-1 promotes an anti-inflammatory response.

J	Ren, XJ; Li, BX				Ren, Xiao-Jun; Li, Bao-Xing			First-principles study on stability and magnetism of AlnZn (n=1-9) clusters	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						AlZn clusters; Stable structure; Magnetism	ALUMINUM CLUSTERS; APPROXIMATION; GEOMETRY; ENERGY; IONS	We have investigated the structures, stabilities and magnetism of zinc-doped Al-n (n=1-9) clusters in detail by using first-principles density functional theory. Our calculated results indicate that the ground state structures of the mixed AlnZn (n=1-9) clusters doped with one zinc atom can be obtained from the most stable structures of the pure Al-n (n=2-10) clusters by substitutional type. The impurity atom causes local structural distortion due to different atomic radii and different bonding characteristics. It is found that the clusters with total atom numbers of 3 and 7 exhibit high stability. In addition, the energy gaps E(g)s between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) show obvious even/odd alternation with cluster size. Furthermore, we investigate the magnetism of the mixed clusters. The Al4Zn, Al6Zn and Al8Zn clusters with even number of electrons do not have any magnetism. All Al1Zn, Al5Zn, Al2Zn and Al9Zn clusters have the total magnetic moment of 1.0 mu(B) due to one unpaired electron. Unexpectedly, the Al2Zn and Al3Zn clusters show total magnetic moments of 2.0 and 3.0 mu(B), respectively. The magnetism arises from the sp-d hybridization due to charge transfer and the influence of the impurity zinc atom. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To better understand abnormal mutant phenotypes in floral development, we conducted detailed observations and investigations of the morphology, cytology, and cell ultrastructure of wild-type Chinese cabbage (Brassica campestris L. ssp. chinensis Makino and syn. B. rapa ssp. chinensis) flowers when they developed from primordia to anthesis. First, we measured bud and organ length with a stereo microscope and observed the developmental status and characteristics of the floral organs using a scanning electron microscope; then we made thin slices of anthers to observe the developmental stage and characteristics of pollen using an optical microscope; and finally, we made super-thin slices of anthers to observe the ultrastructure of pollen during its development with the aid of a transmission electron microscope. In this study, the floral developmental continuum was divided into 17 stages based on significant changes in the shape of floral primordia, and the pollen developmental continuum was divided into 14 stages based on the developmental characteristics. The results could provide the morphological basis for further research on the molecular mechanisms that regulate development of the floral organs and/or pollen of Chinese cabbage and their allied species.

As shown by proton NMR, ESI mass spectrometry and UV-vis spectroscopy, it binds paraquat with a 1: 1 stoichiometry and an association constant of 4.50 (+/- 0.02) x 10(3) M-1 in water. Its complexation with paraquat in water was further investigated by fluorescence emission spectroscopy. The results revealed that when paraquat was added to the water solution of the host, the fluorescence emission of the host was quenched by the charge transfer between the crown ether host and paraquat guest. A similar bis-p-phenylene-34-crown-10-based host was synthesized as a contrasting host. Lacking the naphthalene unit, the second host binds paraquat with a 1: 1 stoichiometry and a lower association constant, 1.04 (+/- 0.04) x 10(3) M-1, in water. This demonstrated that the naphthalene unit could not only act as a strong fluorescence group but also improve the pi-pi stacking interactions between the host and guest.

The present study was designed to examine the hypothesis that stimulation of prostanoid TP receptors impairs endothelium-independent relaxations to cyclic AMP-elevating agents via increasing the activity of phosphodiesterases (PDEs). Rat carotid arteries without endothelium were isolated and suspended in myograph for the measurement of changes in isometric tension; the tissue content of cyclic AMP was assayed by enzyme immunoassay kit; and prostanoid TP receptor was detected in vascular wall by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. In phenylephrine-contracted rings without endothelium, relaxations induced by isoprenaline (receptor-mediated) and forskolin (receptor-independent) were markedly reduced by the presence of a prostanoid TP receptor agonist, U46619; the attenuated relaxations were prevented by acute treatment with S18886, the selective prostanoid TP receptor antagonist, but not by protein kinase C inhibitors. The reduced relaxations were partially restored by IBMX (non-selective PDE inhibitor), cilostazol (PDE3 inhibitor), rolipram (PDE4 inhibitor) or by Y27632 (Rho kinase inhibitor), but not by T0156 (PDE5 inhibitor). U46619 diminished isoprenaline- or forskolin-stimulated rise in cyclic AMP and this effect was inhibited by cilostazol, rolipram or Y27632. The present results suggest that activation of prostanoid TP receptors impairs cyclic AMP-dependent vasorelaxations partly via PDE- and RhoA/Rho kinase-dependent mechanisms. Inhibitors of PDEs and Rho kinase may be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular complications. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their photophysical properties were investigated by UV-vis absorption, both steady-state and time-resolved emission. According to fluorescence excitation and time-resolved emission spectroscopic studies, efficient intramolecular resonance energy transfer was observed in both triads. Furthermore, the influence of the molecular structure on the energy transfer rates was also studied and discussed. To gain insights into the intramolecular interactions and the electronic structures, the electronic structures of both triads were investigated through theoretical calculation. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

In recent years, trehalase proteins have been purified from several insect species and are divided into soluble (Tre-1) and membrane-bound (Tre-2) trehalases. However, no functions of the two trehalases in chitin biosynthesis in insects have yet been reported. Principal Findings: The membrane-bound trehalase of Spodoptera exigua (SeTre-2) was characterized in our laboratory previously. In this study, we cloned the soluble trehalase gene (SeTre-1) and investigated the tissue distribution and developmental expression pattern of the two trehalase genes. SeTre-1 was expressed highly in cuticle and Malpighian tubules, while SeTre-2 was expressed in tracheae and fat body. In the midgut, the two trehalase genes were expressed in different locations. Additionally, the expression profiles of both trehalase mRNAs and their enzyme activities suggest that they may play different roles in chitin biosynthesis. The RNA interference (RNAi) of either SeTre-1 or SeTre-2 was gene-specific and effective, with efficiency rates up to 83% at 72 h post injection. After RNAi of SeTre-1 and SeTre-2, significant higher mortality rates were observed during the larva-pupa stage and pupa-adult stage, and the lethal phenotypes were classified and analyzed. Additionally, the change trends of concentration of trehalose and glucose appeared reciprocally in RNAi-mutants. Moreover, knockdown of SeTre-1 gene largely inhibited the expression of chitin synthase gene A (CHSA) and reduced the chitin content in the cuticle to two-thirds relative to the control insects. The chitin synthase gene B (CHSB) expression, however, was inhibited more by the injection of dsRNA for SeTre-2, and the chitin content in the midgut decreased by about 25%. Conclusions: SeTre-1 plays a major role in CHSA expression and chitin synthesis in the cuticle, and SeTre-2 has an important role in CHSB expression and chitin synthesis in the midgut.

A mutation in the Kit gene leads to novel gonadal phenotypes in both heterozygous and homozygous mice	HEREDITAS			English	Article							STEM-CELL FACTOR; FACTOR RECEPTOR PROTOONCOGENE; C-KIT; MOUSE	The direct sequencing of the Kit cDNA obtained from mutant mice was used to reveal the molecular nature of the W-3Bao ENU-induced mutation. There was a T to A transversion at the 441st nucleotide in the W-3Bao open reading frame (ORF), which introduced a pre-mature termination codon at residue 147. The gross embryonic development, hematopoiesis and spermatogenesis were examined in the mutant mice. There was no visible difference among the W-3Bao/+, W-3Bao/3Bao and wild type embryos before embryonic day 12.5. W-3Bao/3Bao embryos appeared pale after E14.5 and dwarf after E16.5. An extremely low level of hematochrome and large red blood cells were found in W-3Bao/3Bao 18.5 days old embryos, leading to the stillbirth of the homozygotes. In 18.5 days old embryos the spermatogonia of W-3Bao/3Bao embryos did not migrate to the contorted seminiferous tubules properly, but instead were found in the interstitial tissue. The spermatogonia of W-3Bao/+ or W+/+ mice were present in both the interstitial tissue and contorted seminiferous tubules. In the adult male hetereozygotes, there are contorted seminiferous tubules with no spermatogonia, suggesting that the migration defect was dominant. In female W-3Bao/3Bao ovaries, primordial follicles were absent while primordial follicles appeared clearly in the ovaries of W-3Bao/+ or W+/+ mice. With a nonsense mutation in the Kit gene, W-3Bao/+ mice show white spotting and an abnormal development of the contorted seminiferous tubules and W-3Bao/3Bao mice are stillborn due to severe macrocytic anemia, and have abnormal genital glands in both the male and female.

The objective of this study was to determine the contamination and toxicity of surface sediment of Nanguan River, which runs through the e-waste recycling area of Taizhou, East China. Surface sediments were collected from Nanguan River, including one from the control site, four near the household workshops, and two near the industrial parks. Levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metals/metalloid (Ni, Pb, Cd, Cr, Zn, Cu, Hg, and As), which are most widely detected in e-waste contaminated surroundings, were determined. Acute toxicity and genetic toxicity were evaluated by luminescence inhibition assay in luminescent bacterium Vibrio qingaiensis sp. nov. (Q67) and Vicia faba roots tip micronucleus assay, respectively. The surface sediment has been seriously contaminated by PCBs, PAHs, and heavy metals/metalloid due to the e-waste disassembly process. Significant acute and genetic toxicity of the sediments presented a big threat to the aquatic life and human health through food chain, as the river is an extent water source for local residents. The environmental issue of e-waste recycling is emergent and measures should be taken to mitigate the adverse impacts of e-waste disassembly.

The Job plots based on proton NMR data demonstrated that both the complex between cryptand 1 and paraquat derivative 2a and the complex between bis(p-phenylene)-34-crown-10 (3) and paraquat derivative 2b have 1:1 stoichiometry in solution. The apparent association constants (K-a,K-exp) of 1.2a and 3.2b calculated for 1:1 complexes were 1.4 (+/-0.2) x 10(4) and 4.7 (+/-0.5) x 10(2) M-1, respectively. X-ray analysis showed that 1.2a is stabilized by ten hydrogen bonds and face-to-face pi-stacking interactions in the solid state, while 3.2b is stabilized by four hydrogen bonds and face-to-face pi-stacking interactions. As well as in the X-ray structure of 1.2c, a water molecule acts as a hydrogen bridge between the beta-pyridinium protons of 2a and the ether oxygen atoms of 1 in 1.2a. The successful preparation of 1.2a demonstrated that the tert-butyl group is not big enough to be a stopper for rotaxanes based on 1.

The biochemical properties of the recombinant enzyme and its enantioselective hydrolysis of (RS)-1-phenylethyl acetate were studied. Removal of the signal peptide greatly increased the enzyme's expression level by 4.3 times. The purified JC lipase had an optimum temperature of 55A degrees C and optimum pH of 9. Furthermore, comparisons with other enzymes suggest that a few amino acid alterations may significantly change the thermostability of this enzyme. The hydrolysis of (RS)-1-phenylethyl acetate with the crude recombinant JC lipase at 25A degrees C produce (R)-1-phenylethanol in 97.7% e.e. and 46.1% yield after 24 h, corresponding to an E value of 237.

[gamma-(2-Thiazole-ureido)propyl]methyldiethoxysilane (TUPMDES) was firstly sythesized. Polysiloxane (PTUPMDES) and complexes (PTUPMDES-Cu, PTUPMDES-Ni) were prepared via sol-gel process, respectively. They were characterized by IR, (1)H-NMR, SEM and MS. The structure of the complexes was characterized by FTIR, which suggested that chelation had taken place and was demonstrated by the shift of the characteristic absorption bands. The magnetic properties of these complexes were measured using a physical property measurement system (PPMS 29), which included magnetization versus temperature, magnetization versus applied field, magnetic susceptibility versus temperature and magnetic hysteresis. The temperature was ranged from 5 K to 300 K, and the intensity of magnetic field was in the range of 4 x 106 4 X 10(6) A/m. It was found that these complexes were organic soft magnets and had typical "S" shaped magnetic hysteresis loops. The saturation magnetization of PTUPMDES-Cu, PTUPMDES-Ni and PTUPMDES-DMS-Ni was 4.39 emu/g, 5.75 emu/g, 5.27 emu/g, and their remanence magnetization and coercivity were 0.002 emu/g, 0.003 emu/g, 0.002 emu/g and 1510 A/m, 1565 A/m, 1293 A/m, respectively. While the paramagnetic Curie temperature was 168 K, 163 K, 263 K. It was discovered that the Curie-Weiss temperature almost increased twice, when the dimethylsiloxane segments were introduced into the polysiloxane chains containing thiazole groups.

Eliminations of H2S, CH3SH and (NSC)SCH3 were the three fragmentation reactions observed in the tandem mass spectra, witnessed by the MS/MS analysis of native S-34-isotopic ion and the D-labeling CID-MS experiment. Of the three fragmentations, both the added proton and the internal thiocarbamide hydrogen shift to the fragment ion (m/z 106) in the dissociation of losing (NSC)SCH3, while both of them shift to the neutral fragment H2S to generate the minor product ion at m/z 177. In the case of the feasible fragmentation process of CH3SH elimination, one of the proton/the thiocarbamide hydrogen migrates to the fragment ion at m/z 163, and the other migrates to the neutral specie. Calculated results show that thiocarbamide sulfur (S5) is the most thermodynamically favored position for protonation. The mechanisms of these reactions were postulated according to the theoretical results, and the reaction energy profiles were also constructed. These results indicated that fragmentation of the protonated molecule was viewed as a result of the coordinated migration of both the external proton and the thiocarbamide hydrogen.

The catalytic properties of the materials were tested for the Mizoroki-Heck reaction. Compared with Pd material supported on the naked SBA-15, the Pd catalyst supported on the surface modified SBA-15 exhibits very high activity, recoverability and stability for the Mizoroki-Eleck reaction. N(2) adsorption-desorption isotherms and the low-angle X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns indicate that the parent ordered mesoporous structure was well-maintained during the synthesis process. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was also used to investigate the morphology of the composite. High efficiency of the catalyst was proved in the Mizoroki-Heck reaction and the catalyst could be recycled five times without any loss of its catalytic activity.

Because embryos benefit by developing as rapidly as possible, and can "afford" to expend energy to do so (because they have access to the yolk for nutrition), they benefit from rapid heart (and thus, developmental) rates. In contrast, hatchlings do not have a guaranteed food supply, and maximal growth rates may not enhance fitness-and so, we might expect a lower heart rate, especially at high temperatures where metabolic costs are greatest. Our data on two species of emydid turtles, Chrysemys picta, and Graptemys pseudogeographica kohnii, support these predictions. Heart rates of embryos and hatchlings were similar at low temperatures, but heart rates at higher temperatures were much greater before than after hatching.

The single-parameter infinitesimal transformation group and infinitesimal transformation vector of generator are introduced. The definitions about conformal invariance of Hamilton function and conformal invariance of Hamilton system under second-class Mei symmetry are given. The relationship between the system's conformal invariance and Mei symmetry are discussed. The necessary and sufficient condition that the system's conformal invariance would be Mei symmetry is deduced. The system's corresponding conserved quantities are obtained with the aid of a structure equation which is satisfied by the gauge function. Lastly, an example is provided to illustrate the application of the result.

However, little is known about the mechanism(s) underlying the therapeutic effect of ACSO in inhibiting the formation of atherosclerostic lesion. This study aimed to investigate whether ACSO could modulate tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced expression of intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1, monocyte adhesion and TNF-alpha-mediated signaling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. While TNF-alpha promoted the intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 m-RNA transcription in a dose- and time-dependent manner, ACSO treatment significantly reduced the levels of TNF-alpha-induced intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 mRNA transcripts (P < 0.01). Furthermore, ACSO dramatically inhibited TNF-alpha triggered adhesion of THP-1 monocytes to endothelial cells and porcine coronary artery rings. Moreover, ACSO mitigated TNF-alpha induced depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential and overproduction of superoxide anion, associated with the inhibition of NOX4, a subunit of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-oxidase, mRNA transcription. In addition, ACSO also inhibited TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation of JNK, ERK1/2 and I kappa B, but not p38. Apparently, ACSO inhibited proinflammatory cytokine-induced adhesion of monocytes to endothelial cells by inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling and related intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 expression, maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential, and suppressing the overproduction of superoxide anion in endothelial cells. Therefore, our findings may provide new insights into ACSO on controlling TNF-alpha-mediated inflammation and vascular disease. Anat Rec, 293:421-430, 2010. (C) 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

However, their cellular specificity in postnatal central nervous system has not been characterized and their dynamic expressional relationship during oligodendrocyte lineage progression has not been determined. Here we report that both Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.2 are selectively expressed in Olig2+ cells of oligodendrocyte lineage in postnatal spinal cords. Although Nkx6.2 is specifically expressed in the APC+ mature oligodendrocytes, Nkx2.2 is initially expressed in differentiating oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) but quickly down-regulated as OPCs undergo terminal differentiation. Intriguingly, Nkx2.2 expression is up-regulated in mature myelinating oligodendrocytes at later stages. The co-expression of Nkx2.2 and Nkx6.2 transcription factors in myelinating oligodendrocytes suggests their functional interactions in the regulation of myelin sheath formation and/or maintenance.

However, little is known about their distribution in Uighurs. Objectives: This study aimed at characterizing the frequency of these HIV-related gene variants in a high-risk Uighur population. Study designs: A total of 251 HIV-1 seropositive and 238 seronegative high-risk Uighurs were recruited and their genotypes of CCR5-Delta 32, CCR5m303A, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A were analyzed by PCR and PCR-ligase detection reaction (PCR-LDR). Results: The allelic frequency of CCR5-Delta 32, CCR5m303A, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A was 4.40%, 2.66%, 25.66% and 57.36%, respectively, in this population. Apparently, the Uighur population has low frequency of CCR5-Delta 32 and CCR5m303A, but high frequency of CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A. While there was no significant difference in the frequency of CCR5-632, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A between HIV-1 seropositive and seronegative groups the frequency of CCR5m303A in HIV-1 seropositive group was significantly higher than that in seronegative group (P = 0.006, OR = 3.982 and 95%CI 1.514-10.476). Conclusions: Our data suggest that the CCR5-Delta 32, CCR2-64I and SDF1-3'A variants may have limited effect on protecting from HIV-1 infection in Uighurs. Rather, the CCR5m303A may be associated with the risk for HIV-1 infection in high-risk Uighurs. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to test whether the level of interleukin-18 measured on admission can predict long-term adverse clinical events in patients with STEMI who were undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We recruited 288 consecutive STEMI patients (210 men, average age [71.42 +/- 10.32] years) with onset <6 hours who were undergoing primary PCI, and 148 age- and gender-matched control subjects. Plasma levels of IL-18 were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in all subjects. The patients with STEMI were then followed prospectively over 434 days (range, 0 to 642 days) for the occurrence of composite major adverse clinical events (MACE) (cardiac mortality, recurrent myocardial infarction, or readmission due to advanced heart failure). Patients with STEMI exhibited higher levels of plasma IL-18 (P < 0.001) compared with the control subjects. Positive correlations between IL-18 and cardiac troponin-I (cTnI) (r = 0.353, P = 0.0004) and IL-18 and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (r = 0.420, P < 0.001) were observed by Spearman's correlations analysis. Logistic regression analysis demonstrated that IL-18 >= 450 pg/mL (OR 10.854, 95% CI 2.328 to 50.594, P < 0.0001) was a significant independent predictor of composite MACE at 60 days. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that high plasma IL-18 levels were not correlated with the occurrence of long-term composite MACE. The level of plasma IL-18 on admission may predict 60-day adverse clinical outcome, but not the long-term adverse clinical events in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI, and may be useful for mid-term risk stratification.

J	Du, WG; Lu, D				Du, Wei-Guo; Lue, Dan			An Experimental Test of Body Volume Constraint on Female Reproductive Output	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL ZOOLOGY PART A-ECOLOGICAL AND INTEGRATIVE PHYSIOLOGY			English	Article							LIZARD TAKYDROMUS-SEPTENTRIONALIS; RELATIVE CLUTCH MASS; LIFE-HISTORY TRAITS; OFFSPRING SIZE; EGG-SIZE; LOCOMOTOR PERFORMANCE; NATURAL-SELECTION; EVOLUTION; NUMBER; SHAPE	The body volume constraint hypothesis is a widely accepted notion that explains proximate limitation of female reproductive output, but lacks empirical support. To examine how body volume determines reproductive output, we experimentally manipulated the body volume of female lacertid lizard (Takydromus septentrionalis), to examine whether a reduction in body volume caused a reduction in reproductive output. Clutch size and mass decreased with a reduction in body volume. Reproductive output (residual clutch mass, R-CM) was negatively related to body volume reduction (BVR) (R-CM = -0.008BVR+0.225). In contrast, neither egg size nor offspring size was affected by the manipulation. Relative clutch mass was lower in manipulated females than in control females, but the actual physical burden (egg plus pearls) carried by manipulated females was much bigger than that of the control females. A normal clutch of eggs only filled 55% of maternal body volume, whereas manipulated females used 75% of body volume to contain eggs and pearls. Therefore, females are capable of carrying more eggs than a normal clutch. Our observations provide unequivocal empirical support for the maternal body volume constraint hypothesis. In addition, these results suggest that female T. septentrionalis may produce a clutch of eggs that fill the available abdomen space to an optimal level rather than the physical limit. J. Exp.

Here we report the genetic map construction of two Dendrobium species with a double pseudo-testcross strategy using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and sequence-related amplified polymorphism (SRAP) markers. A F1 mapping population of 90 individuals was developed from a cross between D. officinale and D. hercoglossum. A total of 307 markers, including 209 RAPD and 98 SRAP, were identified and used for genetic linkage group (LG) analysis. The D. officinale linkage map consisted of 11 major linkage groups and 3 doublets, which covered 629.4 cM by a total of 62 markers with an average locus distance of 11.2 cM between two adjacent markers. The D. hercoglossum linkage map contained 112 markers mapped on 15 major and 4 minor linkage groups, spanning a total length of 1,304.6 cM with an average distance of 11.6 cM between two adjacent markers. The maps constructed in this study covered 92.7% and 82.7% of the D. hercoglossum and D. officinale genomes respectively, providing an important basis for the mapping of horticultural and medicinal traits and for the application of marker-assisted selection in Dendrobium breeding program.

It is found that in the PLSM, the three phase transitions, i.e. the chiral restoration of u, d quarks, the chiral restoration of s quark and the deconfinement phase transition, are independent. There exists a two-flavor quarkyonic phase at low-density and a three-flavor quarkyonic phase at high density. The critical end point (CEP) which separates the crossover from the first-order line in the PLSM model is located at (T-E, mu(E)) = (188 MeV, 139.5 MeV). In the transition region, the thermodynamic properties and the bulk viscosity over entropy density ratio zeta/s are also discussed in the PLSM.

Identification of genomic regions influencing the response of yield and its components to waterlogging stress will enhance our understanding of the genetics of waterlogging tolerance and the development of more tolerant barley cultivars. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for grain yield and its components were identified using 156 doubled haploid (DH) lines derived from a cross between the cultivars Yerong (waterlogging-tolerant) and Franklin (waterlogging-sensitive) grown under different conditions (waterlogged and well drained). A total of 31 QTLs were identified for the measured characters from two experiments with two growth environments. The phenotypic variation explained by individual QTLs ranged from 4.74% to 55.34%. Several major QTLs determining kernel weight (KW), grains per spike (GS), spikes per plant (SP), spike length (SL) and grain yield (GY) were detected on the same region of chromosome 2H, indicating close linkage or pleiotropy of the gene(s) controlling these traits. Some different QTLs were identified under waterlogging conditions, and thus different markers may have to be used in selecting cultivars suitable for high rainfall areas.

Females thermoregulated more precisely but did not shift their selected body temperatures during pregnancy, with females at high body temperatures giving birth early in the breeding season. The lowest (22 degrees C) and highest (32 degrees C) temperature treatments increased maternal mortality and resulted in production of offspring with smaller body dimensions. More deformed offspring were produced at 32 degrees C, and more poorly performing offspring were produced at 22 degrees C. In the field, air temperatures lower than 22 degrees C and higher than 32 degrees C accounted for about 9% and 33% of total temperature readings, respectively. However, offspring produced by field-caught females did not differ from those produced by laboratory-kept females with body temperatures optimal for embryonic development in nearly all traits examined. This suggests that in nature, gravid females avoid exposure of their embryos to temperature extremes through thermoregulation. Our study validates the key prediction of the maternal manipulation hypothesis that maternal thermoregulation should enhance fitness-related offspring traits, and demonstrates that viviparity evolves in temperate reptiles because internal development shields offspring from temperature extremes.

Sixteen pairs of pigs were used in our experiment. Each pair was composed of two male full sibs, one of which was castrated at 35 days old and the other remained intact. Eight pairs of pigs were slaughtered at 147 and 210 days old, respectively. Boars weighed more than barrows-at 210 days old. However, barrows ate more feed and showed higher carcass fat weight, leaf fat weight and average back fat thickness at 147 and 210 days old. Higher serum leptin but lower testosterone concentration was found in castrated pigs as compared to intact pigs. Castration induced an increase in Ob mRNA in both subcutaneous fat and leaf fat tissue in male pigs. However, there were no differences in hypothalamic expression of Ob-Rb between barrows and boars. These results suggest that castration may influence leptin sensitivity in male pigs.

Methods: The effects of baicalin and the 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton on the changes induced by OGD/recovery or H2O2 (an exogenous reactive oxygen species [ROS]) in green fluorescent protein-5-LOX-transfected PC12 cells were compared. Results: Both baicalin and zileuton attenuated OGD/recovery-and H2O2-induced injury and inhibited OGD/recovery-induced production of 5-LOX metabolites (cysteinyl leukotrienes) in a concentration-dependent manner. However, baicalin did not reduce baseline cysteinyl leukotriene levels. Baicalin also reduced OGD/recovery-induced ROS production and inhibited 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear envelope and p38 phosphorylation induced by OGD/recovery and H2O2. In contrast, zileuton did not show these effects. Conclusion: Baicalin can inhibit 5-LOX activation after ischemic injury, which may partly result from inhibition of the ROS/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.

Except for the obvious interaction between organocatalyst and substrate, the impact of bulky side group ons stereoselectivity is not as simple as one Could imagine. Within the development of bulky site-stereoselective organocatalysts, functional silyl organocatalysts with a bulky silicon group are promising and meet the high standards of modern synthetic methods. This review focuses on the recent advances in the synthetic applications of silicon-based, bulky amino organocatalysts in which catalysts containing an organosilicon moiety or group play a formative role in controlling both the course of the reaction as well as the stereoselectivity.

J	Yin, QP				Yin Qiping			Did William Morris Once Opt for Escape?	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Morris; reality; escape; culture; anxiety		A great number of Western scholars hold the view that much of Morris' s poetry was deliberately escapist. A close reading of Morris' s poems in their cultural context, however, reveals that they are actually not meant for retreat and escape. It is true that the subjects of many of his erly poems are by ang large derived from ancient or medieval myths and legends, but the realistic pictures unfolded in such parts as the "Prologue" and "Apology" serve as frames of reference constantly reminding the reader of the need to make a comparison between the old days, which boasted numerous heroes and heroic deeds, and the "empty days" of the 19th century. Isobel Armstrong has once developed a View which merits attention, namely, the works such as The Defence of Guenevere and Other Poems are an attempt to be the form in which modem consciousness works. The present paper seeks to prove that, in addition to refracting the imprisoned modem consciousness and the dashed modem imagination, Morris's early poems are realistically significant in many other ways, especially in refracting the cultural anxiety in the 19th century Britain. In view of the overall cultural anxiety permeating through Morris's works, the scope of research conducted by Armstrong is a bit too narrow.

To explore issues arising during preliminary stages of a research project in order to consider the feasibility of a midwife-led normal birthing unit in mainland China. Background. Midwife-led normal birthing units, as a route to ensuring normality, have become a feature of western maternity care, but are unknown in China. Design. Action research, using a qualitative descriptive approach, was performed. Data were collected at meetings, by non-participant observation and by face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Observation was undertaken in the midwife-led normal birthing unit and a standard care setting. Data analysis was by thematic analysis using constant comparison techniques. Methods. In the labour ward of a large general hospital in a major city, stakeholders included midwifery staff, managers, university staff and researchers. Childbearing women proved keen to use this service, but were unable to participate in the planning. The midwife-led normal birthing unit sought to provide one-to-one care in labour and support by a birth companion. Routine interventions were to be avoided. Results. The midwives in the midwife-led normal birthing unit created a more suitable environment for supportive care. The midwives demonstrated high-quality communication skills. The woman's choice of position/mobility was limited. Difficulties with staffing were identified. Conclusions. The preliminary findings suggest that continuation of the project is feasible. The woman's role demonstrates passivity. The perception of staff shortage has serious implications. Relevance to clinical practice. This action research project suggests that a study of a midwife-led normal birthing unit in China is feasible, with some attention to staffing issues.

As a major inflammatory mediator, prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)) plays an important role in the inflammatory process of AD. Up to now, there is still controversy on the neuroprotective or neurotoxic role of PGE(2). However, the role of PGE(2) in neurodegeneration may be far more complex, due to the 4 EP receptor subtypes. This article aims to summarize the relationship between PGE(2) receptor EP subtypes and AD. It is believed that a better understanding of the PGE(2) receptor EP subtypes may help to clarify the relation between inflammation and AD, and to develop novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific EP receptor for AD treatment.

Chen et C. Ling (Curcuma wenyujin) and Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi (Scutellaria baicalensis). This study used three parts to compare the two herbs. Firstly, animals were randomly divided into a Scutellaria baicalensis group, a Curcuma wenyujin group, an indomethacin group, and a model-control group to perform an ear edema test, a carrageenin-induced paw edema test, a cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and an acetic acid-induced writhing test. Secondly, model rats with pelvic inflammation were established, and the serum levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 in each group was detected with the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). Thirdly, pharmacokinetics analysis of Scutellaria baicalensis and Curcuma wenyujin was conducted on the model rats. The ear edema test, carrageenin-induced paw edema test, cotton pellet-induced granuloma formation test, and acetic acid-induced writhing test all showed that Curcuma wenyujin had stronger anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects than Scutellaria baicalensis. There is significant difference between the effects of Curcuma wenyujin and Scutellaria baicalensis on the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 for the model rats. Curcuma wenyujin decreased the levels of TNF-alpha and IL-6 more than Scutellaria baicalensis. The pharmacokinetics analysis showed that curcumol's T(max), C(max), and the area under the curve (AUC) were all higher than baicalin's. This study indicated that for pelvic inflammation, Curcuma wenyujin had better anti-inflammatory and anti-nociceptive effects than Scutellaria baicalensis.

J	Shu, L; Sun, BJ; Du, WG				Shu, Lin; Sun, Bao-Jun; Du, Wei-Guo			Effects of temperature and food availability on selected body temperature and locomotor performance of Plestiodon (Eumeces) chinensis (Scincidae)	ANIMAL BIOLOGY			English	Article						Plestiodon (Eumeces) chinensis; thermal acclimation; food availability; selected body temperature; locomotor performance	THERMAL TOLERANCE; TAKYDROMUS-SEPTENTRIONALIS; GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIZARDS; ASSIMILATION; SENSITIVITY; METABOLISM; DEPENDENCE; PREFERENCE	Remarkable temporal and spatial variations occur on selected body temperature (T-sel) and locomotor performance for Plestiodon (Eumeces) chinensis, commonly known as Chinese skinks. However, the significance of these variations remains elusive. This study focuses on the effects of thermal environment and food availability on I? chinensis's T-sel and locomotor performance. The duration of thermal treatment (4h and 8h) displayed significant effects on T-sel, additionally the effects of thermal treatment were also dependent on food-availability. There was no significant variation in skink's T-sel under diverse thermal treatments when sufficient food was available. However, with insufficient food source, the T-sel decreased with decrease in the duration of thermal treatment. Thermal acclimation also affected locomotor performance of I? chinensis, as the 8h thermal treatment enhanced their locomotor performance. However, food availability alone had no significant impact on the locomotor performance. Therefore, the combination of thermal acclimation and food availability could cause variations in T-sel and locomotor performance of skinks, suggesting that thermal environment and food condition in nature are important factors involved in temporal and spatial variations for T-sel and locomotor performance.

Animals were allocated to three dietary treatments: basal and supplemented with 3% corn oil (CNO), or CNO plus 500 mg/kg vitamin E (COE). The experiment lasted for 10 weeks. No differences were observed in growth performance and carcass qualities among the three treatments (P > 0.05). Feeding CNO and COE diets increased polyunsaturated FAs including cis 9 trans 11 conjugated linoleic acid, and decreased saturated FA in longissimus muscle (P < 0.05). The mRNA abundances of ACC and SCD as detected by real-time PCR were reduced (P < 0.05) in liver and subcutaneous fat by supplementary oil, while the SCD mRNA level in longissimus muscle was also reduced (P < 0.05). Inclusion of vitamin E did not have further effects on mRNA abundances of these two enzymes. It is suggested that dietary corn oil supplementation may reduce FA biosynthesis and influence FA profiles in Hu sheep through decreased expression of both ACC and SCD genes.

Design/methodology/approach - The electrochemical measurements (EIS, polarization curves) were applied to study the electrode processes of brass in fresh water at different pH values. Findings - The paper finds that the depolarizer in the electrode process of brass corrosion is different in solutions with different pH values, and has different key steps in the electrode processes. Hence, EIS is a better tool for the determination of the optimum polarization potential for brass in fresh water when the depolarizer of the cathodic half-cell reaction in corrosion reaction is the dissolved oxygen. However, when the depolarizer in solution is changed, and especially if the reduction reaction of depolarization is not controlled by the mass transport, the EIS method may be not suitable to determine the OPP. Originality/value - There have been few reports on the effect of pH on the applicability of EIS as a tool for determining the OPP. In this paper, it is clearly shown that the EIS method be suitable only to determine the OPP when the critical step in the electrochemical process is diffusion of the depolarizer. This research can offer theoretical guidelines for the application of EIS to determine the OPP in ICCP.

Paraffin sections of primary SCC of the tongue and normal mucosa were screened immunohistochemically for Notch I and EGFR proteins. Human SCC of the tongue Tca8113 cells were treated with AG1478 to block EGFR signalling, and were transfected with the vector that encodes the specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) that targets EGFR. In SCC of the tongue expression of Notch I was cancelled except in sites of squamous metaplasia where it was raised, while expression of EGFR was found in the peripheral cells of carcinomas, but not in sites of squamous metaplasia. In normal tongue mucosa, Notch1 was expressed mainly in the stratum corneum, but not in the stratum basale, while EGFR was expressed mainly in the stratum basale, but not in the stratum granulosum or stratum corneum. The blocking of EGFR signalling or the silencing of the EGFR gene resulted in upregulation of Notch1 at mRNA and protein levels in Tca8113 cells. These observations suggest that downregulation of Notch I in oral SCC may be associated with upregulation of EGFR signalling. (C) 2009 The British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons.

A step toward comprehension of heavy unsaturated bonds	CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							STABLE 5-MEMBERED-RING ALLENES; X-RAY-STRUCTURE; OXIDATIVE ADDITION; SILYLENE INSERTION; GROUP-14 ELEMENTS; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; LIGAND PROPERTIES; LOW COORDINATION; SILICON-SULFUR; METAL ALKYLS	Synthesis and structural characteristics of an isolable dialkylsilylene and its application for the synthesis of unique silicon unsaturated compounds such as silanechalcogenones, silaketenimines, a tetrasila-1,3-diene and a trisilaallene are discussed. Because the silylene has no aromatic or alkenyl substituents, the derivatives are mostly free from the influence of the p-conjugative substituents, and hence, are suitable for exploring the intrinsic or standard characteristics of the unsaturated bonds. Using perturbation molecular orbital (PMO) theory, the importance of pi-sigma* mixing is emphasized to figure out the key issues of heavy unsaturated bonds.

Crystal structures of the compounds show that the length of alkyl chains substituting on the thiophene ring has a significant influence on molecular packing. A densely packed structure with an interfacial distance of about 3.66 angstrom between the adjacent molecules is observed for the compound with shorter alkyl chains. However, a large interfacial distance (7.99 angstrom) is obtained for another compound because of the insertion of long alkyl chains between two planes. The investigation of the optical and electrochemical properties shows that the silylene bridge incorporated into the pentathienoacene framework exerts a clear effect on the electronic properties by the sigma*-pi* conjugation. Although only a slight enhancement is observed for the HOMO levels, with respect to that of pentathienoacene, the LUMO levels are significantly lowered. The observed electronic properties are consistent with the theoretical calculations.

The crystal structure of C16H13ClN4O2 center dot HBr center dot H2O (I), the quaternary ammonium salt of 4c, was determined by X-ray diffraction analysis. I crystallizes in triclinic, space group P (1) over bar with a = 8.3121(8), b = 9.3885(8), c = 13.2903(12) angstrom, alpha = 106.788(2), beta = 95.204(3), gamma = 110.871(2)degrees, V = 905.81(14) angstrom(3), Z = 2, C16H16BrClN4O3, M-r = 427.68, D-c = 1.568 g/cm(3), F(000) = 432.00, mu = 2.446 mm(-1), R = 0.0496 and wR = 0.127. X-ray analysis reveals that C(15) in the BrCH2COOH molecule binds to the N(1) of pyrimidine ring to form the quaternary ammonium salt. Two adjacent I molecules are connected by hydrogen bonds through carboxylate oxygen, water molecule and hydrobromic acid.

For a non-adiabatic MNF taper, it is illustrated that optical losses vary with the transition region length and the optical wavelength. We explain how the complicated multimode evolutions result in the complicated optical loss and wavelength response properties, especially when the waist diameters are large enough to allow much higher-order modes. These results may offer valuable references for trapping and guiding cold atoms in atom optics and practical application of micro/nano-devices.

We establish, in this article, necessary and sufficient conditions for an ideal of a regular ring to be generalized stable. It is shown that every regular square matrix over such ideals admits a diagonal reduction. These extend the corresponding results of generalized stable regular rings.

A ring is strongly J-clean in case each of its elements is strongly J-clean. We investigate, in this article, strongly J-clean rings and ultimately deduce strong J-cleanness of T(n)(R) for a large class of local rings R. Further, we prove that the ring of all 2 x 2 matrices over commutative local rings is not strongly J-clean. For local rings, we get criteria on strong J-cleanness of 2 x 2 matrices in terms of similarity of matrices. The strong J-cleanness of a 2 x 2 matrix over commutative local rings is completely characterized by means of a quadratic equation.

The silicon moieties are considered to be insulating tetrahedral spacers in these silicon-containing copolymers. The substituents on silicon can readily be tuned and the steric environment of these substituents around the silicon may dictate the conformation (or helicity) of the copolymers and hence their photophysical properties. This substituent effect on silicon can be understood by the concept of the Thorpe-Ingold effect.

Protozoan communities were sampled monthly using PFU (polyurethane foam unit) method at the four stations with different pollution/eutrophication levels. Physical-chemical parameters (e.g., water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD5), chemical oxygen demand (COD), ammonium nitrogen (NH4-N), and nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N) were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. A total of 53 protozoan taxa with nine common species were identified comprising 33 ciliates, 17 flagellates, 3 sarcodines. Multivariate analyses demonstrated that the spatial taxonomic patterns of protozoan communities significantly correlated with environmental conditions, especially related to the concentrations of COD, BOD5, NO3-N, and NH4-N, either alone or in combination with one another. Although species richness was found to be independent of physical-chemical parameters, the average taxonomic distinctness (Delta(+)) were positively significantly correlated with the concentration of dissolved oxygen and NO3-N, but negatively with COD and BOD5. It is suggested that spatial pattern of protozoan communities and taxonomic biodiversity can be used in assessing water quality of flowing river systems.

Elemene was used as the oil phase and drug, polysorbate 80 as a surfactant along with ethanol, propylene glycol, and glycerol as the cosurfactants. The microemulsion was prepared by mixing method, or ultrasonication method in an ultrasonic bath. Its three-dimensional response surface diagram was drawn by Mathcad software. The microemulsion was characterized by visual observation, cross-polarized microscopy, size, zeta potential, acidity, viscosity, and surface tension measurement. The drug content and entrapment efficiency were determined by ultra fast liquid chromatography (UFLC) and liquid surface method. Blood was drawn from rats at different time points after oral administration of an elemene microemulsion or a commercial elemene emulsion for measurement of the drug in plasma by UFLC to establish the pharmacokinetic parameters and relative bioavailability. The elemene microemulsion as a clarified and isotropic system containing 1% elemene (w/v), 5% ethanol (v/v), 15% propylene glycol (v/v), 15% glycerol (v/v), and 5% polysorbate 80 (w/v), was characterized as (57.7 +/- 2.8) nm in size, 0.485 +/- 0.032 in polydispersity index, (3.2 +/- 0.4) mv in zeta potential, (5.19 +/- 0.08) in pH, 6 mpa.s in viscosity, (31.8 +/- 0.3) mN.m(-1) in surface tension, (8.273 +/- 0.018) mg.mL(-1) in content of beta-elemene, and (99.81 +/- 0.24)% in average entrapment efficiency. The area under the concentration-time curves from 0 h to 24 h (AUC(0 -> 24h)) of the elemene microemulsion and commercial elemene emulsion were integrated to be 3.092 mg.h.L-1 and 1.896 mg.h.L-1 respectively, yielding a relative bioavailability of 163.1%. The present study demonstrates the elemene microemulsion as a new formulation with ease of preparation, high entrapment efficiency, excellent clarity, good stability, and improved bioavailability.

As a research focus in recent years, polyethylene glycol-polylactic acid (PEG-PLA) block copolymer and its end-group derivative nanoparticles can enhance the drug loading of hydrophobic drugs, reduce the burst effect, avoid being engulfed by phagocytes, increase the circulation time of drugs in blood, and improve bioavailability. Additionally, due to their smaller particle size and modified surface, these nanoparticles can accumulate in inflammation or target locations to enhance drug efficacy and reduce toxicity. Recent advances in PEG-PLA block copolymer nanoparticles, including the synthesis of PEG-PLA and the preparation of PEG-PLA nanoparticles, were introduced in this study, in particular the drug release and modifiable characteristics of PEG-PLA nanoparticles and their application in pharmaceutical preparations.

Conformal factor expression is deduced through relationship between a system's conformal invariance and Lie symmetry. The necessary and sufficient condition that the system's conformal invariance would be Lie symmetry under transformations by the infinitesimal one-parameter transformation group is obtained. The conformal invariance of weak and strong Lie symmetry for the nonholonomic system of Chetaev's type is given using restriction equations and additional restriction equations. And the system's corresponding conserved quantity is derived with the aid of a structure equation that gauge function satisfied. Lastly, an example is taken to illustrate the application of the result.

The total amino acid, essential amino acid and nonessential amino acid contents of barrows were significantly higher (P<0.01, <0.001, <0.001, respectively) than the ones of boars. Additionally, the content of several saturated fatty acids and total mono-unsaturated fatty acids was significantly higher (P<0.001), and total polyunsaturated fatty acids was significantly lower (P<0.001) in the LD muscle of barrows than in boars. Compared with boars, barrows had lower (P<0.05) growth rates after 147 days, higher (P<0.05) intramuscular fat content at 147 days, and higher (P<0.01) average back fat thicknesses at 147 and 210 days. These results suggest that the amino acid and fatty acid compositions of LD muscle from male pigs, as well as growth rates and meat quality, were influenced by castration, and, to a lesser degree, by slaughter age.

A family of air-stable 2-D complexes [RECuL4(H2O)4]nLn (RE = La (1), Ce (2), Eu (3), and Gd (4)) have the same crystal system (monoclinic) and space group (P21/c). The chains which are made by the carboxylate-bridged alternating Cu(II)-RE(III) fragments spreading along the c-axis are linked through hydrogen bonds by uncoordinated carboxylates to form a 2-D network structure along the bc planes.

We investigated its enantioselective interactions, and that of its (S)-isomer, with Penicillium expansum alkaline lipase and phosphatase. UV differential spectroscopy and fluorescence spectrophotometry studies were conducted in phosphate buffered solution at pH 7. Chiral differences in the UV absorption and fluorescence spectra of lipase and phosphatase with metolachlor and its (S)-isomer were detected. The results showed that the interactions of metolachlor and its (S)-isomer with lipase and phosphatase occur statically through complex formation, and enantioselectivity was clearly observed. In addition, both UV absorption and fluorescence spectrophotometry showed that the (S)-isomer interacted more strongly with lipase and phosphatase than metolachlor.

Incubation length increased nonlinearly as temperature decreased, with the mean incubation length being 76.7 d at 24 degrees C, 57.4 d at 27 degrees C. 47.3 d at 30 degrees C, and 44.1 d at 33 degrees C. Hatching successes were lower at the two extreme temperatures (69% at 24 degrees C, and 44% at 33 degrees C) than at the other two moderate temperatures (96% at 27 degrees C, and 93% at 30 degrees C). Incubation temperature affected nearly all hatchling traits examined in this study. Incubation of Z. dhumnades eggs at 33 degrees C resulted in production of smaller hatchlings that characteristically had less-developed carcasses but contained more unutilized yolks. Hatchlings from eggs incubated at 27 and 30 degrees C did not differ in any examined traits. Taking the rate of embryonic development, hatching success and hatchling phenotypes into account, we conclude that the temperature range optimal for incubation of Z. dhumnades eggs is narrower than the range of 24-33 degrees C but should be wider than the range of 27-30 degrees C.

Plausibly, then, incubation temperatures might affect hatchling thermoregulation, either via adaptation (i.e., populations that historically experience different nest conditions, also will diverge in hatchling thermoregulatory behaviour) or phenotypic plasticity (incubation temperatures directly modify hatchling behaviours). We tested this hypothesis with a montane scincid lizard (Bassiana duperreyi), using thermal-imaging methods to quantify temperatures (of both head and body) selected by hatchling lizards. The Young lizards kept their heads cooler than their bodies, but mean selected temperatures did not differ among hatchlings from three populations with differing thermal regimes in natural nests, nor were they affected by thermal conditions during incubation. The conservatism of mean selected temperatures stands in strong contrast to the lability of many other phenotypic traits in response to incubation temperatures in this species.

The film character and structure were probed with contact angle measurement, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and atomic force microscope (AFM). The results suggest that the structure of the film is similar to lotus, and the seawater contact angle is larger than 150 degrees. Moreover, the corrosion resistances of untreated and modified samples in seawater were investigated by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Experimental results show that the corrosion rate of Fe3Al-type intermetallic with super-hydrophobic surface decreases dramatically because of its special microstructure.

The composition and purity of the corresponding products were analyzed by (1)H NMR. The results proved the functionalization of P2 (pre) and P2 (post) were 40% and 100%, respectively. The results also indicated that the postpolymerization method would be a better approach to prepare TTF-pendant conjugated ethynylene-fluorene polymers. The postpolymerization methodology could be extended to synthesize other conjugated fluorene-based polymers bearing TTF units (P3 and P4). The polymers mentioned above exhibited good solubility in normal organic solvents and higher conductivity (neutral conductivity similar to 2-4 x 10(-6) S cm(-1); doped conductivity similar to 1-3 x 10(-3) S cm(-1)). Moreover, the fluorescence intensity of P2 ( post) could be modulated by the oxidation of TTF units, which makes it an attractive candidate for the fluorescence switch.

Rh(PPh3)(3)Cl exhibited excellent catalytic activity and selectivity. (KOBu)-Bu-t was used as an additive, and no hydrogenation by-product (alkane) was detected in the scCO(2)/IL system. During hydrosilylation in the scCO(2)/IL system, the reactants were possibly transferred into the IL phase by scCO(2), in which the catalyst was dissolved. The products can be flushed with scCO(2) after the reaction and the catalyst/IL system reused.

The silole derivatives induced gelation of only hydrocarbon solvents and showed aggregation-induced emission (AIE) in the gel state, in contrast to very weak emission in solution. The polarized optical microscopic (POM) and field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) studies exhibited that the xerogels formed fibrous structures. Hydrogen bonding and pi-stacking interactions were the main driving forces for the formation of organogels, based on the FT-IR and absorption investigations. Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and POM studies indicated that both compounds 1a and 1b exhibited stable liquid crystalline (LC) phases over a wide temperature range. It is interesting that uniform and well-ordered monolayers were also obtained for both compounds on the HOPG surface. The new silole derivatives are quite unique because they can self-assemble into one-dimensional (fibres), three-dimensional (liquid crystal) and even two-dimensional (molecular monolayer) aggregates.

J	Yin, QP; He, C				Yin Qiping; He Chang			Where Is the West-Running Brook Flowing? Robert Frost in Taoist Perspective	ZEITSCHRIFT FUR ANGLISTIK UND AMERIKANISTIK			English	Article								Some critics have argued that the commonality between Frost's poetic philosophy and Taoism lies in "a quest for a thorough freedom," namely, freeing oneself from the bonds of nature, society and the self. While there is validity in such a view, their interpretation seems a bit too reductive in the sense that too much emphasis is given to the tendency, in both Frost's and Taoist philosophy, to Chu Shi (to renounce the world), while this tendency is subtly balanced by a willingness to Ru Shi (to accept the world). The present paper, therefore, seeks to examine the way in which Robert Frost bears affinities to Taoism in the aspect of Ru Shi as well as that of Chu Shi. "West-Running Brook," with its central image of the brook which is at once water and road, offers itself as a good point of entry into the similarities between the themes of Frost and such philosophical ideas as proposed by either Lao Tzu or Zhuang Tzu, and makes us realize Frost's balanced philosophical attitudes toward life.
