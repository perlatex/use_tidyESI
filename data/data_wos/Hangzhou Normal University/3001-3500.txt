Chalkiness is one of the most important appearance quality indicators. Therefore, clarification of the heredity of chalkiness and its molecular mechanisms will contribute to reduction of rice chalkiness. Although a number of QTLs related to chalkiness were mapped, few of them have been cloned so far. In this study, using recombinant inbred lines (RILs) of PA64s and 9311, we identified 19 QTLs associated with chalkiness on chromosomes 1, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 12, which accounted for 5.1 to 30.6 % of phenotypic variations. A novel major QTL qACE9 for the area of chalky endosperm (ACE) was detected in Hainan and Hangzhou, both mapped in the overlapping region on chromosome 9. It was further fine mapped to an interval of 22 kb between two insertion-deletion (InDel) markers IND9-4 and IND9-5 using a BC4F2 population. Gene prediction analysis identified five putative genes, among which only one gene (OsAPS1), whose product involved in starch synthesis, was detected two nucleotide substitutions causing amino acid change between the parents. Significant difference was found in apparent amylose content (AAC) between NILqACE9 and 9311. And starch granules were round and loosely packed in NILqACE9 compared with 9311 by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis. OsAPS1 was selected as a novel candidate gene for fine-mapped qACE9. The candidate gene not only plays a critical role during starch synthesis in endosperm, but also determines the area of chalky endosperm in rice. Further cloning of the QTL will facilitate the improvement of quality in hybrid rice.

In this study, we reported that mouse 04 negative early stage OPCs can be obtained by culturing cortical tissue blocks, and the simultaneous treatment of OPCs with Platelet Derived Growth Factor-AA (PDGFaa), basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), and epidermal growth factor (EGF) is the key for the propagation of mouse OPCs in culture. EGF was found to be a potent mitogen for OPCs and cooperate with PDGFaa to extend cell division and inhibit their differentiation. EGF also collaborates with PDGFaa and bFGF to convert bipolar or tripolar OPCs to more vital fibroblast-like OPCs without compromising their oligodendrocyte differentiation potential. In addition, EGF promoted the survival and proliferation of glial progenitor cells (GPCs) derived from primary OPC cultures, and a mixture of GPCs and OPCs can be obtained and propagated in the presence of EGF, bFGF, and PDGFaa. Once EGF is withdrawn, GPC population decreased sharply and fibroblast-like OPCs changed into typical OPCs morphology, then homogeneous OPCs were obtained subsequently.

Many studies using adult samples support this theory. However, the development of the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal/expressive suppression and how these tendencies relate to depressive symptoms in adolescents remain unclear. To address these questions, 639 Chinese adolescents aged 12-18 years old were asked to report their tendency to use cognitive reappraisal/expressive suppression as well as their depressive symptoms. General linear model multivariate analysis of variance showed a statistically significant age effect for the tendency to use emotion regulation strategies. Further analysis found that these adolescents reported using less expressive suppression as age increased, while there was no age effect for the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal. Moreover, linear regression analysis revealed that the tendency to use cognitive reappraisal in daily life negatively influenced depressive symptoms, while the tendency to use expressive suppression in daily life positively influenced depressive symptoms. These findings provide evidence that support the development of emotion regulation strategies in childhood and adolescence.

In this work, we developed an aqueous phase electrocatalytic hydrogenation (ECH) system based on Pd catalyst to dechlorinate the CIPA mixtures into picolinic acid (PA) at room temperature. Firstly, we evaluated the influence of cathode support and Pd loading on the catalytic performance of cathodes, as well as the effects of operating parameters on the intermediate product selectivity and dechlorination efficiency of the ECH process with 3,6-D as the target compound. Secondly, we analyzed the ECH dechlorination mechanism of 3,6-D with regard to the surface condition of cathode and catholyte pH, and the rate-limiting step of the dechlorination process was also discussed. Finally, we assessed the practicability of the ECH system to dechlorinate the CIPA mixtures into PA by using a plate-and-frame cell. Results demonstrated that Pd/Ni foam cathodes with Pd loading of 2.25-3.6 mg cm(-2) exhibited the optimum ECH dechlorination performance, and the basic aqueous solution and high 3,6-D concentration favored the ECH process. The CIPA mixtures with 47 g L-1 concentration (the total concentration of CIPAs was approximately 250 mM) can be selectively dechlorinated into PA with 99% yield, 76.3% current efficiency, and 2.47 kW h kg(-1) PA specific electric energy consumption at a current density of 208 A m(-2) in a 1.25 M NaOH aqueous solution.

Thirty-five articles (including up to 5741 cases and 6530 controls) were recruited for meta-analysis. The strongest association was observed between FCGR2B rs1050501 and SLE under the recessive genotypic model of C allele in the overall population (CC vs CT/TT, OR = 1.754, 95%CI: 1.422-2.165, P = 1.61 x 10(-7)) and in Asian population (CC vs CT/TT, OR = 1.784, 95%CI; 1.408-2.261, P = 1.67 x 10(-6)). We also found that FCGR3A rs396991 were significant association with the susceptibility to SLE in overall population in recessive model of T allele (TT vs TG/GG, OR = 1.263, 95%CI: 1.123-1.421, P = 9.62 x 10(-5)). The results also showed that significant association between FCGR2A rs1801274 and SLE under the allelic model in the overall population (OR = 0.879 per A allele, 95%CI: 0.819-0.943, P = 3.31 x 10(-4)). The meta-analysis indicated that FCGR3B copy number polymorphism NA1.NA2 was modestly associated with SLE in overall population (OR = 0.851 per NA1, 95%CI: 0.772-0.938, P = 1.2 x 10(-3)). We concluded that FCGR2B rs1050501 C allele and FCGR3A rs396991 T allele might contribute to susceptibility and development of SLE, and were under recessive association model. While, FCGR2A rs1801274 A allele and FCGR3B NA1 were associated with SLE and reduced the risk of SLE.

We approach the problem by transforming the conventional time-non-local master equation into dispersed time-local equations-of-motion. The validity of our approximations is discussed and we find that the non-Markovian terms have to be included for short times. While calculations of the density matrix at short times suffer from the initial value problem, a correlation function has a well defined initial state. The resulting formula for the non-Markovian correlation function has a simple structure and is as convenient in its application as the conventional quantum regression theorem for the Markovian case. For illustrations, we apply our method to investigate the spectrum of the current fluctuations of interacting quantum dots contacted with two electrodes. The corresponding non-Markovian characteristics are demonstrated.

Here, we demonstrated that gelsolin was down-regulated in human gastric cancer tissues, and lower tumorous gelsolin significantly correlated with gastric cancer metastasis. Functionally, gelsolin suppressed the migration of gastric cancer cells in vitro and inhibited lung metastasis in vivo. In mechanism, gelsolin decreased epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) inducing cytoskeleton remolding through inhibition of p38 signaling to suppress the migration of gastric cancer cell. Moreover, gelsolin bound to and decreased the phosphorylation of PKR, and then inhibited p38 signaling pathway. Finally, similar to the gastric cancer cell lines, PKR-p38 signaling pathway proteins tend to be activated and correlated with low expression of gelsolin in clinical gastric cancer tissues. Altogether, these results highlight the importance of gelsolin in suppression of gastric cancer metastasis through inhibition of PKR-p38 signaling pathway.

J	Zhan, XX; Liu, C; Zhang, ZK; Sun, GQ				Zhan, Xiu-Xiu; Liu, Chuang; Zhang, Zi-Ke; Sun, Gui-Quan			Roles of edge weights on epidemic spreading dynamics	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Social networks; Spreading dynamics; Edge-breaking strategies; Edge weights	NETWORKS	Epidemic spreading on complex networks has attracted much attention in recent years. A large number of studies have focused on investigating the impacts of network topology on spreading dynamics. However, the weighted network is very common in real systems, and we attempt to study the role of edge weights on epidemic spreading. In this work, the spreading process was presented as the SIS model and three edge-breaking strategies according to the weight of the SI links were performed simultaneously, which was used to illustrate the influence of the edge weights. Simulation results on three real networks showed the different spreading patterns of different edge-breaking strategies, which in turn indicated the influence of edge weights on the spreading process. Therefore we can take different measures at different periods according to the edge weights to impede the epidemic. In addition, the detailed analyses of relationship between the edge weight and the network structure was given to interpret the role of edge weights in the epidemic spreading process.

A negative circular dichroism (CD) signal is observed in the 325-450nm region of the CD spectrum of (S,S)-1, while mainly positive bands are observed in the 220-325nm region. Mirror symmetry is observed across the entire wavelength range of the CD spectra of (R,R)-1 and (S,S)-1. An irreversible one-electron oxidation wave with an onset potential at 1.07V is observed by cyclic voltammetry, along with a reversible one-electron reduction wave at -0.85V. Density functional calculations reproduce the experimentally observed data and trends, and provide further insight into the nature of the electronic transitions.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of D+ -> K-pi(+)e(+)nu(e)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							MESON SEMILEPTONIC DECAYS; LATTICE; HEAVY	We present an analysis of the decay D+ -> K-pi(+)e(+)nu(e) based on data collected by the BESIII experiment at the psi(3770) resonance. Using a nearly background-free sample of 18262 events, we measure the branching fraction B(D+ -> K-pi+e+nu e) = (3.77 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.08)%. For 0.8 < m(K pi) < 1.0 GeV/c(2), the partial branching fraction is B(D+ -> K-pi+e+nu e)([0.8,1.0]) = (3.39 +/- 0.03 +/- 0.08)%. A partial wave analysis shows that the dominant (K) over bar* (892)degrees component is accompanied by an S-wave contribution accounting for (6.05 +/- 0.22 +/- 0.18)% of the total rate and that other components are negligible. The parameters of the (K) over bar* (892)degrees resonance and of the form factors based on the spectroscopic pole dominance predictions are also measured. We also present a measurement of the (K) over bar* (892)degrees helicity basis form factors in a model-independent way.	[Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J.

ACS Appl. Mater. Interfaces 2013, 5, 2278]. In the current work, the structure control in these nanofibers has been investigated in detail using scanning electron microscopy, focused ion beam, and small angle Xray scattering. Our results indicate that electrospinning conditions, the adopted solvent, the volume fraction of PS-b-PEO block copolymer, and the amount of titanium tetraisopropoxide in the mixture produce significant effects on both outer-shell and inner-continuous structures in the nanofibers. The parameters discussed above make it possible to achieve programmable structure control in the aspect of the diameter, thickness of the outer shell, and inner continuous pore. As a result, both micropores among fibers and nanopores in certain fibers are under photocatalytic activity of resultant TiO2 fabrics was investigated by taking the photodegradation of Rhodamine B as an example. The results suggest that the degradation efficiency and rate constant exhibit sensitivity on the structure of nanofibers.

Immature female rats (22-23 days old) were injected with pregnant-mare serum gonadotropin to stimulate folliculogenesis, followed by human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) to induce ovulation. Ovaries, granulosa cells, theca-interstitial cells, or cumulus oocyte complexes (COCs) were collected at various times after hCG administration (n = 3 per time point). Expression analysis revealed that Errfi1 and Ifrd1 were highly induced in the ovary, although their spatiotemporal expression differed: In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that Errfi1 mRNA expression was initially induced in theca-interstitial cells at 4 and 8 hr after hCG, then transitioned to granulosa cells at 12 hr, and decreased in newly forming corpora lutea at 24 hr. Ifrd1mRNA, on the other hand, was primarily induced in granulosa cells, and expression remained elevated in newly forming corpora lutea. Interestingly, Errfi1 and Ifrd1 were also expressed in the COC, suggesting a potential role in cumulus cell expansion or oocyte maturation. Inhibition of progesterone or prostaglandin synthesis reduced Errfi1 and Ifrd1 transcription, whereas inhibition of epidermal growth factor signaling inhibited only Errfi1 mRNA abundance. Down-regulation of both genes led to further suppression of progesterone. Our findings thus suggest that the stimulation of Errfi1 and Ifrd1 may be important for theca and granulosa cell differentiation and COC expansion. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

J	Zhou, QQ; Xia, R; Zhang, CZ				Zhou, Qingqing; Xia, Rui; Zhang, Chengzhi			Online Shopping Behavior Study Based on Multi-granularity Opinion Mining: China Versus America	COGNITIVE COMPUTATION			English	Article						Sentiment analysis; Opinion mining; Customer behavior study; Automatic questionnaire generation	CONSUMER REVIEWS; MODERATING ROLE; SENTIMENT; PRODUCT; IMPACT; TWITTER; TOPICS	With the development of e-commerce, many products are now being sold worldwide, and manufacturers are eager to obtain a better understanding of customer behavior in various regions. To achieve this goal, most previous efforts have focused mainly on questionnaires, which are time-consuming and costly. The tremendous volume of product reviews on e-commerce Web sites has seen a new trend emerge, whereby manufacturers attempt to understand user preferences by analyzing online reviews. Following this trend, this paper addresses the problem of studying customer behavior by exploiting recently developed opinion mining techniques. This work is novel for three reasons. First, questionnaire-based investigation is automatically enabled by employing algorithms for template-based question generation and opinion mining-based answer extraction. Using this system, manufacturers are able to obtain reports of customer behavior featuring a much larger sample size, more direct information, a higher degree of automation, and a lower cost. Second, international customer behavior study is made easier by integrating tools for multilingual opinion mining. Third, this is the first time an automatic questionnaire investigation has been conducted to compare customer behavior in China and America, where product reviews are written and read in Chinese and English, respectively. Our study on digital cameras, smartphones, and tablet computers yields three findings. First, Chinese customers follow the Doctrine of the Mean and often use euphemistic expressions, while American customers express their opinions more directly. Second, Chinese customers care more about general feelings, while American customers pay more attention to product details. Third, Chinese customers focus on external features, while American customers care more about the internal features of products.

How to control the spreading process is of particular interests, where the identification of the most influential nodes in larger-scale social networks is a crucial issue. Degree centrality is one of the simplest method which supposes that the node with more neighbours may be more influential. K-shell decomposition method partitions the networks into several shells based on the assumption that nodes in the same shell have similar influence and nodes in higher-level shells (e.g., central) are probably to infect more nodes. Degree centrality and k-shell decomposition are local methods which are efficient but less relevant. Global methods such as closeness and betweenness centralities are more exact but time-consuming. For effectively identifying the more influential spreaders in large-scale social networks, in this paper we proposed an algorithm framework to solve this dilemma by combining the local and global methods. All the nodes are graded by the local methods and then the periphery of the network is removed according to their central values. At last, the global methods are employed to find out which node is more influential. The experimental results show that our framework can be efficient and even more accurate than the global methods	[Xia, Yingjie] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Intelligent Transportat & Informat Secur Lab, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ren, Xiaolong; Zhang, Jianlin; She, Li] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Alibaba Business Coll, Alibaba Res Ctr Complex Sci, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Peng, Zhengchao] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Web Sci Ctr, Chengdu, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Xia, YJ (reprint author), Hangzhou Normal Univ, Intelligent Transportat & Informat Secur Lab, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.	xiayingjie@zju.edu.cn; zhangjohn@vip.sina.com		Ren, Xiaolong/0000-0003-2323-163X	National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61472113, 61304188, 11205042]; Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNatural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province [LZ13F020004, LR14F020003, Y6110317]; CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund	This paper draws on work supported in part by the following funds: National Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number 61472113, 61304188 and 11205042, Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China under grant number LZ13F020004, LR14F020003 and Y6110317, and CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund.		33	10	10	0	16	SPRINGER	DORDRECHT	VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS	1380-7501	1573-7721		MULTIMED TOOLS APPL	Multimed.

Little is known about the molecular pathways that precipitate IMT formation. Here, we report the identification of somatic mutations in UPF1, a gene that encodes an essential component of the nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) pathway, in 13 of 15 pulmonary IMT samples. The majority of mutations occurred in a specific region of UPF1 and triggered UPF1 alternative splicing. Several mRNA targets of the NMD pathway were upregulated in IMT samples, indicating that the UPF1 mutations led to reduced NMD magnitude. These upregulated NMD targets included NIK mRNA, which encodes a potent activator of NF-kappa B. In human lung cells, UPF1 depletion increased expression of chemokine-encoding genes in a NIK-dependent manner. Elevated chemokines and IgE class switching events were observed in IMT samples, consistent with NIK upregulation in these tumors. Together, these results support a model in which UPF1 mutations downregulate NMD, leading to NIK-dependent NF-kappa B induction, which contributes to the immune infiltration that is characteristic of IMTs. The molecular link between the NMD pathway and IMTs has implications for the diagnosis and treatment of these tumors.

We aimed to systematically assess the association between PPAR polymorphisms and CHD risk. Methods: A case-control study with 446 subjects was conducted to evaluate the association between CHD risk and C161T polymorphism, which was of our special interest as this polymorphism showed different effects on risks of CHD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Meta-analyses were conducted to assess all PPAR polymorphisms. Either a fixed-or a random-effects model was adopted to estimate overall odds ratios (ORs). Results: In the case-control study, T allele carriers of C161T polymorphism were not significantly associated with CHD risk (Odds ratio (OR) = 0.74, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47-1.15, P = 0.19), while T allele carriers showed higher risk of ACS (OR = 1.63, 95% CI 1.00-2.65, P = 0.048). The meta-analysis indicated that compared with CC homozygous, T allele carriers had lower CHD risk (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.59-0.82, P < 0.001) but higher ACS risk (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.09-1.87, P = 0.010). Three other polymorphisms were also found to be significantly associated with CHD risk under dominant model: PPAR-alpha intron 7G/C polymorphism (CC+GC vs GG, OR 1.42, 95% CI 1.13-1.78, P = 0.003), L162V polymorphism (VV+LV vs LL, OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97, P = 0.031), and PPAR-delta +294T/C polymorphism (CC+TC vs TT, OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.12-2.05, P = 0.007). Conclusions: The results suggested that PPAR-alpha intron 7G/C and L162V, PPAR-delta +294T/C and PPAR-gamma C161T polymorphisms could affect CHD susceptibility, and C161T polymorphism might have different effects on CHD and ACS.

The prepared RC polymers with different lengths of side chains were applied as compatibilizers in an immiscible poly(l-lactic acid)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PLLA/PVDF) blend, and it was found that the RC polymers with moderate length of side chain (e.g., M-n = 4800 g mol(-1)) displayed better compatibilizing efficiencies than RC polymers with short side chain (e.g., M-n = 2400 g mol(-1)) and let alone the reactive linear (RL) polymers without side chains. The thus obtained PLLA/PVDF blends with PLLA as a matrix will provide excellent adhesion with the surfaces of the metals and cells, and it was found that RC polymers endowed the PLLA/PVDF blend with excellent toughness and the RC-compatibilized blend could be uniaxially stretched to a maximum draw ratio of 5 at room temperature (about 22 degrees C). FT-IR and XRD results showed that the nonpolar alpha phase of PVDF was completely transformed into the piezoelectric beta phase (more than 95%) during the stretching.

A perfect antispastic protocol should include advanced surgical technique and adequate pharmacologic methods. All pharmacologic vasodilator drugs relax the vessel through specific mechanisms, and therefore, there is no perfect, single best vasodilator to prevent or treat spasm of the arterial graft against all mechanisms of contraction. One of the choices is to use a combination of pharmacologic vasodilators targeting different mechanisms of spasm to obtain the reliable and best effect.

However, whether this working memory-driven attentional modulation takes place on early perceptual processes remains unclear. Our present results showed that working memory-driven attention improved identification of a brief Landolt target presented alone in the visual field. Because the suprathreshold target appeared without any external noise added (i.e., no distractors or masks), the results suggest that working memory-driven attention enhances the target signal at early perceptual stages of visual processing. Furthermore, given that performance in the Landolt target identification task indexes spatial resolution, this attentional facilitation indicates that working memory-driven attention can boost early perceptual processing via enhancement of spatial resolution at the attended location.

This metal-free catalytic system displayed high efficiency for coupling aryl halides with CS2 to deliver thioethers. Compared to the conventional methods, no metal catalyst was needed, instead of which the DBU-based ILs played the catalyst and solvent roles simultaneously. Some reactions were carried out under mild conditions (55 degrees C, 0.5 h), giving moderate to high yields. Moreover, compared with the rare reports, the reaction of the aryl chlorides and fluorides with CS2 could smoothly react in this catalytic system. The products were easily separated from the ILs which could be reused at least three times. The present method provides an efficient and environment-friendly catalytic approach to synthesize diaryl thioethers.

This studywas conducted to determine the role of autophagy in an animal model of ventricular fibrillation (VF)/CPR. Methods: Experiment 1: A total of 48 adult Wistar rats were untreated for 7 minutes after induction of VF using an external transthoracic alternating current, and subsequent CPR was performed to observe the existence of autophagy after the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). Experiment 2: A total of 72 rats were pretreated with intracerebroventricular injection of physiologic saline (control group), the autophagy inducer (rapamycin group), or the autophagy inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-methyladenine group) before ROSC to evaluate the contribution of autophagy to neuronal injury after ROSC. Results: The activation of autophagy was attenuated 2 to 4 hours after ROSC, which was related to the activity decrease of 5'-adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase after ROSC. Rapamycin treatment significantly increased the expressions of LC3-II and Beclin-1 after ROSC, attenuated the activation of caspase-3, promoted neuronal survival and decreased neuronal apoptosis, and improved the neurologic deficit score after CPR. Conclusions: The activation of autophagy after ROSC offered a remarkable tolerance to VF/CPR ischemic insult and improved the neurologic outcomes. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is often the prodromal stage to AD. Most patients with aMCI harbor the pathologic changes of AD and demonstrate transition to AD at a rate of 10%-15% per year. Patients with AD and aMCI experience progressive brain metabolite changes. Accumulating evidence indicates that the asymmetry changes of left and right brain happen in the early stage of AD. However, the features of asymmetry changes in both anterior cingulate gyms (ACG) and posterior cingulate gyms (PCG) are still unclear. Here, we examine the left right asymmetry changes of metabolites in ACG and PCG. Fifteen cases of mild AD patients meeting criteria for probable AD of NINDS-ADRDA, thirteen cases of aMCI according to the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Research Center criteria, and sixteen cases of age-matched normal controls (NC) received Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (H-1-MRS) for measurement of NAA/mI, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr ratios in the PCG and ACG bilaterally. We analyzed H-1-MRS data by paired t-test to validate the left right asymmetry of H-1-MRS data in the PCG and ACG. In AD, there was a significant difference in mI/Cr between the left and right ACG (P < 0.001) and the left and right PCG (P = 0.007). In aMCI, there was a significant difference in mI/Cr between the left and right ACG (P < 0.001). In NC, there were no differences in the ratio value of metabolites NAA/mI, NAA/Cr, Cho/Cr, and mI/Cr between the left and right ACG and PCG. Thus, the left right asymmetry of mI/Cr in the ACG and PCG may be an important biological indicator of mild AD. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The vast majority of prostate cancer patients present with bone metastases, which mainly involve the axial bones, with pain as the most common symptom. The present study reports the first case of prostate cancer metastasis to the hallux in a 73-year-old man who presented with pain and a swollen phalanx of the left hallux. This symptom developed gradually over a period of several months and could not be improved with the common treatments. Due to a pathological fracture, amputation of the left phalanx was performed. Notably, the immunohistochemical examinations of the surgical sample demonstrated the presence of a metastatic lesion from prostate cancer. The present study describes an unusual presentation involving phalangeal metastasis in a prostate cancer patient, and a systematic review of reported cases of rare metastatic events in prostate cancer is also discussed.

Major studies about locating and navigation are carried out based only on place cells. Nevertheless, it is known that navigation may also rely on grid cells. Therefore, we model locating and navigation based on both, thus developing a novel grid-cell model, from which firing fields of grid cells can be obtained. We found a continuous-time dynamic system to describe learning and direction selection. In our simulation experiment, according to the results from physiology experiments, we successfully rebuild place fields of place cells and firing fields of grid cells. We analyzed the factors affecting the locating accuracy. Results show that the learning rate, firing threshold and cell number can influence the outcomes from various tasks. We used our system model to perform a goal navigation task and showed that paths that are changed for every run in one experiment converged to a stable one after several runs.

The key of our pose estimation component is to embed the articulated deformation model with exponential-maps-based parametrization into a Gaussian Mixture Model. Benefiting from this probabilistic measurement model, our algorithm requires no explicit point correspondences as opposed to most existing methods. Consequently, our approach is less sensitive to local minimum and handles fast and complex motions well. Moreover, our novel shape adaptation algorithm based on the same probabilistic model automatically captures the shape of the subjects during the dynamic pose estimation process. The personalized shape model in turn improves the tracking accuracy. Furthermore, we propose novel approaches to use either a mesh model or a sphere-set model as the template for both pose and shape estimation under this unified framework. Extensive evaluations on publicly available data sets demonstrate that our method outperforms most state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithms with large margin, especially in the case of challenging motions. Furthermore, our shape estimation method achieves comparable accuracy with state of the arts, yet requires neither statistical shape model nor extra calibration procedure. Our algorithm is not only accurate but also fast, we have implemented the entire processing pipeline on GPU. It can achieve up to 60 frames per second on a middle-range graphics card.

Recently, several microRNA (miRNA) profiling studies were conducted with HCC; however, their inconsistency means that their diagnostic or therapeutic value is debatable. This study aims to systematically evaluate the consistency of miRNAs from multiple independent studies. A systematic analysis of miRNAs from eligible publications was conducted, followed by real-time PCRs. The targets of highly consistent miRNAs were collected using online programs, followed by enrichment analyses for gene ontology terms and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes pathways. In total, 241 differentially expressed miRNAs were reported in 13 HCC profiling studies, of which 137 were upregulated and 104 downregulated. Among consistently upregulated miRNAs (cutoff > fourfold), miRNA-222, miRNA-21, miRNA-221, miRNA-210, and miRNA-224 were found increased in 8, 6, 6, 5, and 5 different studies, respectively. Among 137 downregulated miRNAs, miRNA-195, miRNA-199a, miRNA-125b, and miRNA-99a were reported in 8, 8, 5, and 5 studies, respectively. These results were confirmed by real-time PCR. Enrichment analyses demonstrated that programmed cell death and proliferation play important roles during the interplay of miRNA with HCC. miRNAs most consistently related to HCC are oncomirs miRNA-221/222 and tumor suppressors miRNA-199a/195.

In this study, an up-flow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor, which was started with anammox and methanogenic granules, was operated for 245 days to evaluate the co-treatment of wastewater containing nitrogen and sulfur. The reactor demonstrated good performance in terms of nitrogen and sulfide removal and exhibited excellent behavior for removal of NH4+-N, NO2--N and S2--S exceeding 252, 333 and 330 mg L-1, respectively. The highest nitrogen removal rate and sulfide removal rate attained were 4.00 kgN m(-3) d(-1) and 2.39 kgS m(-3) d(-1), respectively, which were also the highest reported values for a coupling-system. The influent NH4+-N:S2--S and NO2--N:S2--S ratios set at 1.74 and 2.20-2.27 are suitable for maintaining system stability. The specific activities of anammox and autotrophic desulfurization-denitrification (SAA and SADD), extracellular polymeric substance (EPS), heme c (an important cofactor of some anammox bacterial enzymes) and the diversity of anammox and autotrophic desulfurization-denitrification (ADD) bacteria were investigated during the operation. The SAA and SADD are regarded as key factors for high efficiency. The granules contained many EPS (128.4-204.5 mg g(-1) VSS) and minor heme c content (1.17 mu mol g(-1) VSS). The dominant bacteria belonged to members of Brocadiaceae and Hydrogenophilaceae, a majority of which were anammox bacteria and ADD bacteria, respectively. These observations suggest a new removal process for ammonia, nitrite and sulfide utilizing an uncommon mechanism involving simultaneous anammox and ADD. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The materials ZJU-64 and ZJU-64-CH3 exhibit low toxicity by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium (MTT) assay, microscopy images, and cell-cycle analysis; this indicates their potential applications for human health care. The anticancer drug methotrexate (MTX) is successfully loaded into MOFs by a simple impregnation method and the drug payloads reach approximately 13.45 and 10.63 wt% for ZJU-64 and ZJU-64-CH3, respectively. The sustainable drug-release behavior of MTX from MTX-loaded ZJU-64 and ZJU-64-CH3 is detected for several days. The temperature-responsive deliveries of ZJU-64 and ZJU-64-CH3 reveal that hyperthermia can control the drug release and open up a new treatment which combines drug therapy and thermal therapy to kill more cancer cells with fewer side effects; this reveals the practical value of ZJU-64 and ZJU-64-CH3 as "smart" drug carriers with more therapeutic efficacy.

Surfactant-coated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (SC-MWNTs) were used as a pseudostationary phase for the separation of iodate, tetraiodothyronine,triiodothyronine, diiodothyronine, and diiodotyrosine. The effects of MWNTs, concentration of SC-MWNTs and salt, of buffer pH value, injection times were examined. Under the optimized conditions, i.e. detection at 230 nm, a separation voltage 25 kV, a borate running buffer of pH 7.5 and a SC-MWNT concentration of 9 mu g center dot mL(-1), the method gave relative standard deviations of the retention times and peak areas in intra-day assays (for n = 6) and for inter-day assays (for n = 3) of less than 4.49 and 5.80 %, respectively. The CE method was then applied to the analysis of the above iodine species in (spiked) kelp (kunbu) and porphyra, and recoveries ranged from 81.6 to 98.4 % with RSDs (n = 3) for extraction repeatability of < 3.39 % in all cases.

J	Yan, YJ; Jin, JS; Xu, RX; Zheng, X				Yan, YiJing; Jin, Jinshuang; Xu, Rui-Xue; Zheng, Xiao			Dissipation equation of motion approach to open quantum systems	FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS			English	Review						quantum dissipation; quantum transport; entangled system-and-bath dynamics	HIERARCHICAL EQUATIONS; TRANSPORT; DYNAMICS	This paper presents a comprehensive account of the dissipaton-equation-of-motion (DEOM) theory for open quantum systems. This newly developed theory treats not only the quantum dissipative systems of primary interest, but also the hybrid environment dynamics that are also experimentally measurable. Despite the fact that DEOM recovers the celebrated hierarchical-equations-of-motion (HEOM) formalism, these two approaches have some fundamental differences. To show these differences, we also scrutinize the HEOM construction via its root at the influence functional path integral formalism. We conclude that many unique features of DEOM are beyond the reach of the HEOM framework. The new DEOM approach renders a statistical quasi-particle picture to account for the environment, which can be either bosonic or fermionic. The review covers the DEOM construction, the physical meanings of dynamical variables, the underlying theorems and dissipaton algebra, and recent numerical advancements for efficient DEOM evaluations of various problems. We also address the issue of high-order many-dissipaton truncations with respect to the invariance principle of quantum mechanics of Schrodinger versus Heisenberg prescriptions. DEOM serves as a universal tool for characterizing of stationary and dynamic properties of system-and-bath interferences, as highlighted with its real-time evaluation of both linear and nonlinear current noise spectra of nonequilibrium electronic transport.

Here, we obtained the other two novel genes (HaTreh1-3 and HaTreh1-4) by transcriptome sequencing and rapid amplification of cDNA ends. Generally, anabolism enhancement and catabolism inhibition together contribute to accumulation of trehalose, and trehalase is the key enzyme to start the catabolism of trehalose. To characterize the metabolism of trehalose in H. axyridis and how these trehalase genes are regulated under cold stress conditions, a comparison of trehalose content and trehalase levels in two different rapidly changing temperature environments was carried out to explore the regulation of these genes. We found that an accumulation of trehalose could be observed at 5 degrees C, 0 degrees C and -5 degrees C and trehalase was suppressed in these temperature points during a gradually cooling environment. Then, in a gradually warming environment, trehalose levels increased slightly from -5 degrees C to -15 degrees C and then decreased at 25 degrees C; however, no significant negative association was observed between trehalase and trehalose. Additionally, we found that glycogen could be converted into trehalose to help the individual resist the low temperature. Analysis of the expression of soluble trehalase showed that HaTreh1-1, HaTreh1-2, HaTreh1-3 and HaTreh1-4 were involved in trehalose metabolism; but the gene HaTreh1-4 plays the most important role in the cooling process, and HaTreh1-2 and HaTreh1-4 play the most important role in the warming process. Finally, we found that 5 degrees C might be a temperature signal for H. axyridis; prior to this temperature, individuals must make enough physical preparations to resist cold stress during the winter.

In this paper, fluorinated perylene diimide (FPDI) was used as novel organic electron transport material in planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells. The perovskite film was fabricated by sequential vacuum vapor deposition, and the film morphology could be controlled by optimizing the FPDI film morphology with short time solvent spin-coating or solvent vapor annealing (SVA). Dense and uniform perovskite film with high substrate coverage could be obtained when the FPDI film was treated by chloroform SVA for half an hour, and the fill factor (FF) of the perovskite solar cell increased from 30.44% to 55.20%, enhancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) from 3.23% to 7.44%. The PCE of the best device reached 7.93%, which was comparable to that (8.25%) of the conventional ZnO electron transport layer based perovskite device prepared by the same method.

The results showed that the IC50 of ROX and Cu (II) on PN sludge were 346 and 74.3 mg L (1), respectively. The relative specific respiration rate (SRR) of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) decreased from 87.4% to 17.7% with the ROX concentration increased from 0 to 500 mg L (1). When the concentration of Cu(II) increased from 0 to 160 mg L (1), the SRRs of AOB and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria decreased by 85.5% and 11.2%, respectively. According to the isobole plots analysis, combined suppression by ROX and Cu(II) was synergistic. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses showed that ROX exposure altered the positions of C-O bonds, and the intensity of the absorption peak at 2100 cm (1) changed under Cu(II) exposure.

The best results were obtained using Florisil (150 mg) as the sorbent and 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (0.4 mL, 250 mM) as the elution solvent. This work represents the first attempt of using ionic liquids as a green eluent for extraction of the investigated compounds in miniaturized MSPD. Compared with the conventional methods, the proposed method is advantageous due to improved enrichment factor and reduced reagent consumption. A good linearity was observed with r(2) values (>0.998). Meanwhile, the method gave acceptable recoveries (90.16-96.47%) for the determination of flavonoids in plant samples. The limits of detection of the two analytes ranged between 4.08 and 5.04 mu g/g.

Besides, anyone can be convinced by the single short signature that the n messages m(1),...,m(n) were definitely signed by the n users u(1),...,u(n) correspondingly. The concept of certificateless cryptography is proposed, so as to settle the key escrow problem in ID-based cryptography and eliminate the demand for certificates in certified cryptography. A certificateless signature scheme was proposed by Chen et al. in 2014, which was extended into a certificateless aggregate signature scheme. In this paper, two attacks are firstly provided, so as to indicate that the certificateless signature scheme is insecure against a Type I adversary and a Type II adversary. And then, it is demonstrated that the certificateless aggregate signature scheme is not able to achieve the security levels they claimed due to the weaknesses of the certificateless signature scheme.

The experimental conditions for the MSPD extraction, including the type of adsorbent, the amount of dispersing sorbent, the grinding time, and the type of elution solvent were investigated and optimized. The optimized parameters were determined to be that middle molecular-weight chitosan was used as adsorbent, the amount of middle-molecular-weight chitosan was selected to be 25 mg, the grinding time was chosen to be 60 s, and methanol: water (6:4, v:v) was used as elution solvent. Compared with reported methods, the proposed method was more simple, rapid, and efficient. Moreover, this method required less extraction time and less amount of sample and solvent. The method showed good linearity (r(2) >= 0.9909) for the seven analytes, with the limits of detection in the range of 69.6-358.4 ng/g. And recoveries were above 80.06%. The methodology was successfully applied to the extraction and determination of seven phenolic compounds in olive fruits(Canarii fructus). (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our measurements showa typical double-peak structure in the voltage-biased junction conductance at low temperatures, probably excluding the existence of topological Andreev bound states. The conductance curves can be well fitted with the standard Blonder-Tinkham-Klapwijk model for s-wave superconductors, yielding a superconducting gap Delta(0) similar or equal to 0.92 meV with 2 Delta(0)/k(B)T(c) similar to 4.1. Our results strongly suggest that beta-PdBi2 is a conventional intermediate-coupling s-wave superconductor.

The measurements of magnetic susceptibility (chi), resistivity (rho), and specific heat capacity (C) were carried out. Bulk superconductivity is revealed by the jump at T-c of the specific heat with Delta C/gamma T-n(c) approximate to 1.63, suggesting moderate electron-electron coupling strength in this system. The upper critical field mu H-0(c2)WHH (0) was estimated to be of 89 kOe, and mu H-0(c2)GL (0) = 107 kOe, which is close to the Pauli limiting field. The Ginzburg Landau parameter kappa(GL) = 50.2, indicates that Re6Hf is a type-II superconductor. The temperature dependence of the electronic specific heat C-el (T) in the superconducting state can be explained by BCS theory. Furthermore, the magnetic-field dependence of gamma(H) is found to be linear with respect to H. These results imply a dominant s-wave superconductivity in Re6Hf.

Observation of an Anomalous Line Shape of the eta 'pi(+)pi(-) Mass Spectrum near the p(p)over-bar Mass Threshold in J/psi -> gamma eta 'pi(+)pi(-)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							BARYONIUM; GLUEBALL; X(1835); STATE; QCD	Using 1.09 x 10(9) J/psi events collected by the BESIII experiment in 2012, we study the J / psi -> gamma eta'pi(+)pi(-) process and observe a significant abrupt change in the slope of the eta'pi(+)pi(-) invariant mass distribution at the proton-antiproton (p (p) over bar) mass threshold. We use two models to characterize the eta'pi(+)pi(-) line shape around 1.85 GeV/c(2): one that explicitly incorporates the opening of a decay threshold in the mass spectrum (Flatte formula), and another that is the coherent sum of two resonant amplitudes. Both fits show almost equally good agreement with data, and suggest the existence of either a broad state around 1.85 GeV/c(2) with strong couplings to the c final states or a narrow state just below the p (p) over bar mass threshold. Although we cannot distinguish between the fits, either one supports the existence of a p (p) over bar moleculelike state or bound state with greater than 7 sigma significance.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X.

However, many Physalis species have similar shapes and are easily confused, and consequently the phylogenetic relationships between Physalis species are poorly understood. This hinders their safe utilization and genetic resource conservation. In this study, the nuclear ribosomal ITS2 region was used to identify species and phylogenetically examine Physalis. Eighty-six ITS2 regions from 45 Physalis species were analyzed. The ITS2 sequences were aligned using Clustal W and genetic distances were calculated using MEGA V6.0. The results showed that ITS2 regions have significant intra- and inter-specific divergences, obvious barcoding gaps, and higher species discrimination rates (82.2% for both the BLASTA1 and nearest distance methods). In addition, the secondary structure of ITS2 provided another way to differentiate species. Cluster analysis based on ITS2 regions largely concurred with the relationships among Physalis species established by many previous molecular analyses, and showed that most sections of Physalis appear to be polyphyletic. Our results demonstrated that ITS2 can be used as an efficient and powerful marker in the identification and phylogenetic study of Physalis species. The technique provides a scientific basis for the conservation of Physalis plants and for utilization of resources.

In this work, aromatic amide-derived nonbiarylatropisomer/silver (silver/Xing-Phos) complex was used to catalyze the Michael addition of glycine aldimino esters to chalcones and successfully applied to the subsequent cyclocondensation to afford substituted cis-(1)-pyrroline derivatives with up to 98%ee. Besides the inherent performance of the chiral Ag/Xing-Phos catalyst system, it was found that the workup of such reactions played an important role for the stereoselective construction of stereodivergent (1)-pyrrolines, in which an epimerization of the cis-(1)-pyrrolines to the trans-isomers during was revealed.

We find that the reactivity of catalysts with the common five-member aromatic rings is lower than that of NHPI. The catalyst with the recyclable structure of imidazolium ionic liquid may serve as a novel model catalyst for further improvements due to its reactivity comparable to that of NHPI. The catalytic reactivity of multi-nitroxyl catalysts is theoretically more fascinating than that of the highly efficient N,N-dihydroxypyromellitimide. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

How to attract college graduates to community services in the future, therefore, has major policy relevance in the government's ongoing efforts to reform community health care and fill in the long-absent role of general physicians in China. This paper examined medical school students' attitudes towards working in communities and the factors that may affect their career choices in primary care to inform policy on this subject. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was designed upon the issuance of community health reform policy in 2006 by the Chinese government. The survey was conducted among 2714 medical students from three medical schools in representative regions in China. Binomial and multinomial regression analyses were carried out using a collection of plausible predictors such as place of rearing, income, etc. to assess their willingness to work in communities. Results: Of the 2402 valid responses, besides 5.7 % objection to working in communities, 19.1 % expressed definite willingness. However, the majority (41.5 %) of students only consider community job as a temporary transition, in addition to 33.7 % using it as their backup option. The survey analyses found that medical students who are more likely to be willing to work in communities tend to come from rural backgrounds, have more exposure to community health reform, and possess certain personally held value and fit. Conclusion: To attract more graduates from 5-year medical schools to work in communities, a targeted recruiting approach or admission policy stands a better chance of success. The findings on the influencing factors of medical students' career choice can help inform policymakers, medical educators, and community health managers to improve the willingness of swing students to enter primary care to strengthen basic health services.

J	Ye, YQ; Hay, D; Shi, ZM				Ye, Yuqian; Hay, Darrick; Shi, Zhimin			Coherent perfect absorption in chiral metamaterials	OPTICS LETTERS			English	Article							ABSORBER; TRANSMISSION; SENSOR; LIGHT	We study the coherent perfect absorption (CPA) of a chiral structure and derive analytically the CPA condition for transversely isotropic chiral structures in circular polarization bases. The coherent absorption of such a chiral system is generally polarization dependent and can be tuned by the relative phase between the coherent input beams. To demonstrate our theoretical predictions, a chiral metamaterial absorber operating in the terahertz frequency range is optimized. We numerically demonstrate that a coherent absorption of 99.5% can be achieved. Moreover, we show that an optimized CPA chiral structure can be used as an interferometric control of polarization state of the output beams with constant output intensity.

The number of deaths is proportional to the global incidence, which highlights the aggressive tumor biology and lack of effective therapies. Dysregulation of microRNAs has been implicated in carcinogenesis and progression of liver cancer. Here, we identified that miR-1258 was significantly downregulated in HCC and associated with poor patients' survival. Overexpression of miR-1258 significantly inhibits liver cancer cell growth, proliferation and tumorigenicity through increasing cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase and promotes cell apoptosis. Interestingly, stable overexpression of miR-1258 suppresses cell migration, stemness and increases sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy drug like doxorubicin. The CDC28 protein kinase regulatory subunit 1B (CKS1B) was identified as a functional downstream target of miR-1258. Re-expression of CKS1B overcomes miR-1258 induced apoptosis and increases stemness of HCC cells, suggesting that loss of miR-1258 contributes to carcinogenesis and progression of liver cancer through targeting CKS1B. Therefore, loss of miR-1258 may be a potential diagnostic and prognostic biomarker and blocking miR-1258-CKS1B axis is a potential therapeutic strategy in HCC.

Most studies on agraphia in AD have been performed in the alphabetic system, such as English. However, these findings may not be applicable to other written language systems. The unique features of the Chinese written script could affect the patterns of agraphia in Chinese AD patients. The aim of this study was to explore the features of writing errors in Chinese patients with AD and amnestic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), as well as to study the relationship between their writing errors and neuropsychological functions. Methods: In this study, we performed an observational study in a group of subjects including 17 AD patients, 14 patients with a-MCI, and 16 elderly healthy controls. We analyzed the writing errors in these subjects and also studied the relationship between their writing errors and neuropsychological functions. Results: Our study showed that in patients whose mother tongue is Chinese, writing ability was comparatively well preserved in the MCI phase but significantly impaired when the disease progressed to the stage of AD. The writing errors showed corresponding increase with the severity of cognition decline, both in the types of errors and rate of occurrence. Analysis of the writing errors showed that word substitution and unintelligible words were the most frequent error types that occurred in all the three study groups. The occurrence rate of unintelligible words was significantly higher in the AD group compared with the a-MCI group (P = 0.024) and control group (P = 0.018). In addition, the occurrence rates of word substitution were also significantly higher in AD (P = 0.013) and a-MCI groups (P = 0.037) than that of control group. However, errors such as totally no response, visuospatial impairment, paragraph agraphia, ideograph, and perseverative writing errors were only seen inAD group. Besides, we also found a high occurrence rate of visuoconstructional errors (13.3%) in our AD group. Conclusions: Our study confirmed that agraphia is an important feature in patients with AD. The writing error profile in patients whose native language is Chinese was unique compared to patients using the alphabetic language system.

Functional neuroimaging has been used to assess differences in the mean strength of brain activity in smokers' brains, however less is known about the temporal dynamics within smokers' brains. Temporal dynamics is a key feature of a dynamic system such as the brain, and may carry information critical to understanding the brain mechanisms underlying cigarette smoking. We measured the temporal dynamics of brain activity using brain entropy (BEN) mapping and compared BEN between chronic non-deprived smokers and non-smoking controls. Because of the known sex differences in neural and behavioral smoking characteristics, comparisons were also made between males and females. Associations between BEN and smoking related clinical measures were assessed in smokers. Our data showed globally higher BEN in chronic smokers compared to controls. The escalated BEN was associated with more years of smoking in the right limbic area and frontal region. Female nonsmokers showed higher BEN than male nonsmokers in prefrontal cortex, insula, and precuneus, but the BEN sex difference in smokers was less pronounced. These findings suggest that BEN mapping may provide a useful tool for probing brain mechanisms related to smoking.

BESIII Collaboration	Improved measurement of the absolute branching fraction of D+ -> (K)over-bar(0)mu(+)nu(mu)	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL C			English	Article							MONTE-CARLO; DECAYS; E(+)E(-); HEAVY	By analyzing 2.93 fb(-1) of data collected at root s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we measure the absolute branching fraction B(D+ -> (K) over bar (0) (+)(mu)nu(mu)) = (8.72 +/- 0.07(stat). +/- 0.18(sys).) %, which is consistent with previous measurements within uncertainties but with significantly improved precision. Combining the Particle Data Group values of B(D-0 -> K- mu(+)nu(mu)), B(D+-> (K) over bar (0)e(+)nu(e)), and the lifetimes of the D-0 and D+ mesons with the value of B(D+ -> (K) over bar (0)mu(+)nu(mu)) measured in this work, we determine the following ratios of partial widths: Gamma (D-0 -> (K) over bar (-)mu(+)nu(mu))/Gamma (D+ -> (K) over bar (0)mu+nu(mu)) = 0.963 +/- 0.044 and Gamma (D+ -> (K) over bar (0) mu+nu(mu))/Gamma(D+ -> (K) over bar (0)e+nu(e)) = 0.988 +/- 0.033.

AsN, AsP and SbAs alloys possess indirect band gap and BiAs is direct band gap. Although AsP, SbAs and BiAs alloyed arsenene sheets maintain the semiconducting character of pure arsenene, they have indirect-direct and semiconducting-metallic transitions by applying biaxial strain. We find that B- and N-doped arsenene render p-type semiconducting character, while C- and O-doped arsenene are metallic character. Especially, the C-doped arsenene is spin-polarization asymmetric and can be tuned into the bipolar spin-gapless semiconductor by the external electric field. Moreover, the doping concentration can effectively affect the magnetism of the C-doped system. Finally, we briefly study the chemical molecule adsorbed arsenene. Our results may be valuable for alloyed and doped arsenene sheets applications in mechanical sensors and spintronic devices in the future.

Background The nursing worklife model describes relationships between supportive nursing work environments and nurse and patient outcomes. The influence of support for professional practice on new nurses' perceptions of professional nursing behaviours within this model has not been tested. Methods Structural equation modelling in Mplus was used to analyse data from a national survey of new nurses across Canada (n = 393). Findings The hypothesised model was supported: chi(2) (122) = 346.726, P = 0.000; CFI = 0.917; TLI = 0.896; RMSEA = 0.069. Professional practice behaviour was an important mechanism through which empowerment and supportive professional practice environments influenced nurse-assessed quality of care, which was related to job satisfaction and lower intentions to leave nursing. Conclusion Job satisfaction and career retention of new nurses are related to perceptions of work environment factors that support their professional practice behaviours and high-quality patient care. Implications Nurse managers can support new graduate nurses' professional practice behaviour by providing empowering supportive professional practice environments.	[Laschinger, Heather K.

Weak intermolecular interactions are observed in the solid-state X-ray crystal structures due to the replacement of fluorine with a phenyl group at the boron atom. Both complexes exhibit high fluorescence in dilute solutions with quantum efficiencies in the range of 0.52-0.88. Because of weak intermolecular interactions and a large Stokes shift, the six-membered-ring complex 1 exhibits efficient solid-state fluorescence. However, the five-membered-ring complex 2 has a small Stokes shift, resulting in weak fluorescence in the solid-state through self-quenching. The structure-property relationships have been analyzed on the basis of X-ray crystallography, optical spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations.

Let A be an N-Koszul twisted CY algebra such that A is a graded H (sigma)- module algebra. We show that the cleft extension A#(sigma) H is also a twisted CY algebra. This result has two consequences. Firstly, the smash product of an N-Koszul twisted CY algebra with a twisted CY Hopf algebra is still a twisted CY algebra. Secondly, the cleft objects of a twisted CY Hopf algebra are all twisted CY algebras. As an application of this property, we determine which cleft objects of U(D, lambda), a class of pointed Hopf algebras introduced by Andruskiewitsch and Schneider, are Calabi-Yau algebras.

Our previous study indicated that it was able to remarkably suppress the neuroinflammation and suggested its potential application in treating neuroinflammatory diseases. Multiple sclerosis (MS), a Th cell-mediated autoimmune disease, is the most common inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). We examined whether daphnetin treatment can protect mice against experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS. Methods: To assess the effect of daphnetin in neuroinflammatory diseases, the EAE mice were established and treated with daphnetin at 8 mg/kg for 28 days. The severity of neuroinflammation and demyelination in the spinal cords was examined histopathologically. Infiltration of CD4(+) T cells into the CNS was assessed by immunohistochemistry, and the cytokine production was determined by ELISA. Meanwhile, the effect of daphnetin on the activity of dendritic cells (DCs) was evaluated, as assessed by DCs' capability to express surface markers, secrete cytokines, and activate naive CD4(+) T cells. Furthermore, we explored the molecular mechanisms whereby DAPH regulated DCs' activity and thereby CD4(+) T cell responses. Results: The administration of daphnetin markedly alleviated the clinical symptoms of EAE and reduced the CNS inflammation and demyelination in experimental mice. Th1 and Th17 cell responses were profoundly repressed in daphnetin-treated EAE mice. Mechanistically, daphnetin treatment significantly repressed the activation, maturation, and antigen-presenting capability of DCs. NF-kappa B signaling was significantly reduced in daphnetin-treated DCs, along with a concomitant induction of heme oxygenase-1, a negative regulator of inflammatory signaling. Conclusions: Our findings for the first time demonstrate the property of daphnetin in regulating DCs' function and subsequently Th development. Given the low or absent toxicity associated with daphnetin, our data may suggest a novel safe and effective approach to control autoimmune neuroinflammation.

Neuritin belongs to a family of neurotrophic factors that promote neurite outgrowth, maintain neuronal survival, and provide a favorable microenvironment for the regeneration and repair of nerve cells after injury. However, it is not known whether the exogenously applied neuritin protein has a positive effect on nerve repair after SCI. This was investigated in the present study using purified human recombinant neuritin expressed in and purified from Pichia pastoris, which was tested in a rat SCI model. A recombinant neuritin concentration of 60 mu g/ml induced the recovery of hind limb motor function and stimulated nerve regeneration in rats with SCI. Continuous administration of neuritin at this dose at an early stage after SCI inhibited poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) protein degradation and decreased neuronal apoptosis. In addition, during the critical postinjury period of axonal regeneration, exogenous neuritin treatment increased the expression of neurofilament 200 and growth-associated protein 43 in the damaged tissue, which was associated with the restoration of hind limb movement. These results suggest that neuritin creates an environment that promotes nerve cell survival and neurite regeneration after SCI, which contribute to nerve regeneration and the recovery of motor function.

Comparison of non-invasive MRI measurements of cerebral blood flow in a large multisite cohort	JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Cerebral blood flow; labeling efficiency; phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging; pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling; semi-automated vessel segmentation	LABELED PERFUSION MRI; ARTERIAL WATER; TRANSIT-TIME; 3.0 T; BRAIN; VOLUME; AUTOREGULATION; RELAXATION; INVERSION; REPRODUCIBILITY	Arterial spin labeling and phase contrast magnetic resonance imaging provide independent non-invasive methods for measuring cerebral blood flow. We compared global cerebral blood flow measurements obtained using pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling and phase contrast in 436 middle-aged subjects acquired at two sites in the NHLBI CARDIA multisite study. Cerebral blood flow measured by phase contrast (CBFPC: 55.76 +/- 12.05ml/100g/min) was systematically higher (p<0.001) and more variable than cerebral blood flow measured by pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (CBFPCASL: 47.70 +/- 9.75). The correlation between global cerebral blood flow values obtained from the two modalities was 0.59 (p<0.001), explaining less than half of the observed variance in cerebral blood flow estimates. Well-established correlations of global cerebral blood flow with age and sex were similarly observed in both CBFPCASL and CBFPC. CBFPC also demonstrated statistically significant site differences, whereas no such differences were observed in CBFPCASL. No consistent velocity-dependent effects on pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling were observed, suggesting that pseudo-continuous labeling efficiency does not vary substantially across typical adult carotid and vertebral velocities, as has previously been suggested. Conclusions: Although CBFPCASL and CBFPC values show substantial similarity across the entire cohort, these data do not support calibration of CBFPCASL using CBFPC in individual subjects. The wide-ranging cerebral blood flow values obtained by both methods suggest that cerebral blood flow values are highly variable in the general population.

Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) are well-characterized adult stem cells that have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effect of ADSCs on Staphylococcus aureus-induced acute lung injury in mice. Our results showed that intratracheal injection of ADSCs could attenuate the severity of lung inflammation, and reduce the bacterial load as well as mortality among infected mice. Our experiments also revealed that the secretion of regenerating islet-derived III (RegIII) is responsible for the protective effect of ADSCs. Moreover, the expression of RegIII requires TLR2, MyD88, and JAK2/STAT3 activation. In conclusion, ADSCs exhibit a direct antimicrobial activity that is mediated primarily by the TLR2-MyD88-JAK2/STAT3-dependent secretion of RegIII.

In the present study, we demonstrated that the migration and invasion activity in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells could be directly influenced by altering miR-146a expression. The expression of RhoA and miR-146a in the breast cancer cells showed an inverse correlation. Upregulation of miR-146a in the MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells by transfection of miR-146a mimics resulted in decreased RhoA protein levels. Conversely, downregulation of miR-146a by transfection of miR-146a inhibitor resulted in increased RhoA protein levels. To confirm the fact that RhoA is a potential target of miR146a, luciferase reporter containing the RhoA 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) was constructed. The results demonstrated that the luciferase reporter activity was reduced after overexpression of miR-146a. Moreover, the luciferase reporter which was constructed with the RhoA 3'UTR mutant did not show significantly altered luciferase reporter activity. Furthermore, after treatment with the RhoA inhibitor exoenzyme C3-transferase protein, the migratory capacity of the MDA-MB-231 cells was not significantly altered even though the amount of miR-146a was changed. Our results indicate that miR-146a functions as a tumor suppressor in breast cancer cells. Downregulation of the expression of miR-146a increased the migration of MDA-MB231 cells, due to the upregulation of RhoA expression.

The present study aimed to assess the influence of Brachyury on the expression of 23 MMP members and to further explore the mechanisms involved in the promotion of NSCLC cell invasion by Brachyury and MMPs in the H460 and H1299 stable cell lines. The protein expression levels and correlations between the brachyury transcription factor and the targeted MMPs were also validated in 52 NSCLC patient tissue samples. We observed that brachyury significantly upregulated MMP12 expression to promote NSCLC cell invasion. We also found a potential binding site for the brachyury transcription factor in the MMP12 promoter.

Evidence is accumulating that suggests that habitat fragmentation can have significant impacts on plant-pollinator interactions. In this article, we review the literature on habitat fragmentation effects on plants, pollinators, and the pollination network. We also discuss pollination network mechanisms that may be affected by habitat fragmentation. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations and affects ecological properties at both population and community levels. Evidence shows that habitat size and connectivity directly or indirectly influence the abundance of both plant and pollinator species. In general, plant and pollinator diversity and population size decrease with the decreasing size and habitat connectivity. Habitat fragmentation of plant communities can shift plant phenological patterns, contract flowering periods and increase the risk of local pollinator extirpation. Fragmentation has the potential to influence pollination dynamics by altering pollinator or plant densities and by altering pollinator behavior. However, evidence for the impact of habitat fragmentation on plant species' flowering phenology is relatively limited, and little is known about the effect of habitat fragmentation on the phenology of pollinators. Habitat fragmentation also leads to reduced reproduction in many species. In contrast, other species showed neutral or positive responses to habitat fragmentation in female reproductive fitness, especially in plants regularly affected by pollen limitation and pollination limitation which lead to plants' experience selection for increased autogamy in isolated habitats. Habitat fragmentation often leads to the extirpation of specialist species and results in an influx of generalists. However, studies have shown that pollinators tend to be more generalized as habitat fragmentation increases. The reason is that habitat fragmentation changes the composition of the flora, and scatters floral resources, so any remaining pollinators may need to behave as generalists in order to survive.

In this paper, we propose a new approach by integrating aerial image's local features into a discriminative one which reflects both the geometric property and the color distribution of aerial image. Firstly, each aerial image is segmented into several regions in terms of their color intensities. And region connected graph (RCG), the links between the spatial neighboring regions, is presented to encode the spatial context of aerial images. Secondly, we mine frequent structures in the RCGs corresponding to training aerial images collected from social media. And a set of refined structures are selected among the frequent ones towards being more discriminative and less redundant. Finally, given a new aerial image, its sub-RCGs corresponding to all the refined structures are extracted and quantized into a discriminative feature for aerial image recognition. The experimental results validate the proposed method by providing a more accurate recognition result of the aerial images on different datasets from different social medias.

We reasoned that coupling hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation with ex vivo transduction of syngeneic HSCs with lentiviral vectors to express proinsulin II could prevent T1D in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice. Methods: Hematopoietic stem cells were isolated from 6- to 8-week-old NOD female mice and transduced in vitro with lentiviral vectors encoding proinsulin II. Preconditioned 3- to 4-week-old female NOD mice were transplanted with transduced or nontransduced HSCs and compared with age-matched unmanipulated control. The insulitis, T1D development, and immune reconstitution were assessed. Results: The mean (SD) insulitis score was significantly reduced (1.156 [0.575] vs 2.156[0.892] or 3.043[0.728], P = 0.009 or < 0.001), and diabetes was nearly completely prevented (1/13 vs 5/12 or 4/9, P = 0.031 or 0.013) in recipients of transduced HSCs expressing proinsulin II as compared with recipients of nontransduced HSCs or unmanipulated control. Sialitis, reconstitution of peripheral blood leukocytes, and in vitro recall responses to ovalbumin were not different between 3 groups of mice. Conclusions: Syngeneic transplantation of HSCs transduced ex vivo with lentiviral vectors to encode proinsulin II is a novel strategy to prevent T1D.

But the biodegradation rates of hydrophobic organic contaminants (HOCs) are usually extremely restricted by their low bioavailability, especially in soil. Here, a physical method (mechanical mixing) and a chemical method (randomly methylated-P-cyclodextrins, RAMEB) were adopted to improve the bioavailability and biodegradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) of an aged soil. The bioavailability of tri-CBs was increased by adding RAMEB in soil/slurry or assisting mechanical mixing in slurry, but these methods had no effects on the bioavailability of tetra-CBs and high chlorinated PCBs (Cl > 4). The degradation rate of tri-CBs could be obviously enhanced by adding RAMEB in soil or assisting mechanical mixing in slurry. The highest removal amount of tri-CBs reached 43.8% in 100 d with a first-order decay kinetics constant of 0.0059 d(-1). But the removal of tetra-CBs and high chlorinated PCBs (Cl > 4) were not significant in all mesocosms, possibly due to the lack or weakness of the native degrading microflora. Based on the analysis of the richness and diversity of bacterial communities, the characteristics of the heatmap and the variation of bphC copy numbers in the soil/slurry mesocosms, it could be inferred that there was no obvious corresponding relationship between the variation of the bacterial communities and the physical/chemical measures.

In the BCDW state, we find that no spin resonance exists and only a broad commensurate peak appears for the frequency dependence of the dynamical spin susceptibility at Q = (pi,pi), though a low-energy spin gap feature can also be found as in the superconducting state. While the "hourglass" type of the dispersion for the BCDW state bears some similarities with that in the superconducting state, the momentum distribution of Im chi (+-)(Q,omega) is just the opposite with the incommensurate peaks lying along the diagonal direction for the energy below omega (c) and along the axial direction above omega (c) . In the coexistence of SC and BCDW, the frequency dependence of the dynamical spin susceptibility at Q = (pi,pi) generally shows the two-peak structure, reflecting two energy scales of the spin excitations. These unique features may serve as signatures to verify whether or not the BCDW state is responsible for the formation of the Fermi arcs.

The stereoselectivity of a series of carbonyl reductases were evaluated toward the reduction of ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate (OPBE). A majority of reductases produced the ethyl (R)-2-hydroxy-4-phenylbutyrate ((R)-HPBE) with low to excellent enantiomeric excess (e.e.), whereas about 30% reductases catalyzed OPBE to form (S)-HPBE. Among them, the carbonyl reductase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SeCR) and short-chain dehydrogenase from Gluconobacter oxydans (GoKR) exhibited 100% e.e., yielding the corresponding (R) and (S)-HPBE, respectively. However, the SeCR showed relative higher activity (29.0U/mg) and affinity (K-m of 0.22mM) than those of GoKR. Docking analysis found that the interaction of OPBE with enzyme-NADPH complex determined the NADPH-provided hydrogen transfer and the configuration of reductive product. These results indicated that the three-dimensional (3D) structure of enzymes controlled the stereoselectivity of the reductive product based on the geometry of the substrate and cofactor.

Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 5 (Lgr5) is the first identified marker of gastric stem cells. However, the role of Lgr5(+) stem cells in driving malignant gastric cancer is not fully validated. Here, we deleted Smad4 and PTEN in murine gastric Lgr5(+) stem cells by the inducible Cre-LoxP system and marked mutant Lgr5(+) stem cells and their progeny with Cre-reporter Rosa26(tdTomato). Rapid onset and progression from microadenoma and macroscopic adenoma to invasive intestinal-type gastric cancer (IGC) were found in the gastric antrum with the loss of Smad4 and PTEN. In addition, invasive IGC developed at the murine gastro-forestomach junction, where a few Lgr5(+) stem cells reside. In contrast, Smad4 and PTEN deletions in differentiated cells, including antral parietal cells, pit cells and corpus Lgr5(+) chief cells, failed to initiate tumor growth. Furthermore, mutant Lgr5(+) cells were involved in IGC growth and progression. In the TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) database, an increase in LGR5 expression was manifested in the human IGC that occurred at the gastric antrum and gastro-esophageal junction. In addition, the concurrent deletion of SMAD4 and PTEN, as well as their reduced expression and deregulated downstream pathways, were associated with human IGC. Thus, we demonstrated that gastric Lgr5(+) stem cells were cancer-initiating cells and might act as cancer-propagating cells to contribute to malignant progression.

The analytes were then determined by CE with LED-induced fluorescence detection. The influencing parameters, such as the sorbent concentration, extraction time, and eluent type, were properly optimized. The established method had the advantages of simplicity, low consumption of sorbent amount (0.009 mg) and organic solvent (100 mu L), and high sensitivity, meeting the principle of green chemistry. Under the optimum conditions, the sorbents allowed the extraction and preconcentration of the flavonoids with enrichment factors in the range from 78 to 166. The recovery study performed at two different fortification levels provided an average recovery >91%. LODs for all the compounds ranged from 0.07 to 17.99 ng/mL. These results demonstrated that the proposed method could be used as a convenient and efficient extraction technique for analysis of flavonoids in different honey matrices.

Fe acquisition may be under the control of a complex interplay of hormones.Several phytohormones have been demonstrated to be involved in iron (Fe) homeostasis. We took advantage of a salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis defective mutant phytoalexin deficient 4 (pad4: T-DNA Salk_089936) to explore the possible effects of endogenous SA on the morphological and physiological responses to Fe deprivation. The morphological and physiological analysis was carried out between Col-0 and the pad4 mutant. Under an Fe-deficiency treatment, Col-0 showed more severe leaf chlorosis and root growth inhibition compared with the pad4 mutant. The soluble Fe concentrations were significantly higher in pad4 than in Col-0 under the Fe-deficiency treatment. Fe deficiency significantly induced SA accumulation in Col-0 and the loss-of-function of PAD4 blocked this process. The requirement of endogenous SA accumulation for Fe-deficiency responses was confirmed using a series of SA biosynthetic mutants and transgenic lines. Furthermore, a comparative RNA sequencing analysis of the whole seedling transcriptomes between Col-0 and the pad4 mutant was also performed. Based on the transcriptome data, the expression levels of many auxin- and ethylene-response genes were altered in pad4 compared with Col-0. Fe deficiency increases SA contents which elevates auxin and ethylene signalling, thereby activating Fe translocation via the bHLH38/39-mediated transcriptional regulation of downstream Fe genes.

Among neuroimaging techniques, resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) is currently expanding exponentially. Beyond the general neuroimaging analysis packages (e.g., SPM, AFNI and FSL), REST and DPARSF were developed to meet the increasing need of user-friendly toolboxes for R-fMRI data processing. To address recently identified methodological challenges of R-fMRI, we introduce the newly developed toolbox, DPABI, which was evolved from REST and DPARSF. DPABI incorporates recent research advances on head motion control and measurement standardization, thus allowing users to evaluate results using stringent control strategies. DPABI also emphasizes test-retest reliability and quality control of data processing. Furthermore, DPABI provides a user-friendly pipeline analysis toolkit for rat/monkey R-fMRI data analysis to reflect the rapid advances in animal imaging. In addition, DPABI includes preprocessing modules for task-based fMRI, voxel-based morphometry analysis, statistical analysis and results viewing. DPABI is designed to make data analysis require fewer manual operations, be less time-consuming, have a lower skill requirement, a smaller risk of inadvertent mistakes, and be more comparable across studies. We anticipate this open-source toolbox will assist novices and expert users alike and continue to support advancing R-fMRI methodology and its application to clinical translational studies.

However, very few VIGS vectors are available for monocot plants. Here we report that Foxtail mosaic virus (FoMV) can be engineered as an effective VIGS system to induce efficient silencing of endogenous genes in monocot plants including barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), wheat (Triticum aestivum) and foxtail millet (Setaria italica). This is evidenced by FoMV-based silencing of phytoene desaturase (PDS) and magnesium chelatase in barley, of PDS and Cloroplastos alterados1 in foxtail millet and wheat, and of an additional gene IspH in foxtail millet. Silencing of these genes resulted in photobleached or chlorosis phenotypes in barley, wheat, and foxtail millet. Furthermore, our FoMV-based gene silencing is the first VIGS system reported for foxtail millet, an important C-4 model plant. It may provide an efficient toolbox for high-throughput functional genomics in economically important monocot crops.

We used a supermatrix approach using three DNA regions: ETS, ITS and matK. Every concatenated sequence was derived from a single specimen. The topology of our phylogenetic reconstruction largely agreed with previous studies. We also gained new insights into the early divergence structure of the two largest clades, core Carex and Vignea clades, challenging some previous evolutionary hypotheses about inflorescence structure. Most sections were recovered as non-monophyletic. Homoplasy of characters traditionally selected as relevant for classification, historical misunderstanding of how morphology varies across Carex, and regional rather than global views of Carex diversity seem to be the main reasons for the high levels of polyphyly and paraphyly in the current infrageneric classification.

In stage 1, the reactor was operated as a common anaerobic baffled reactor (CABR) (constant flow direction), whereas in stage 2, the reactor was modified as a flow switched anaerobic baffled reactor (FSABR) with the flow direction switching every 10 days. Adjusting the feeding regime resulted in an increase in the average nitrogen loading rate (from 1.62 to 1.80 kgN m(-3) d(-1)) and nitrogen removal efficiency (from 75.4 to 83.1%). In addition, a maximum nitrogen removal rate of 3.49 kgN m(-3) d(-1) was obtained in stage 2, compared with 3.00 kgN m(3) d(-1) in stage 1. The sludge properties were also enhanced; from stage 1 to stage 2, the specific anammox activity increased by more than 5-fold, the settling velocity increased from 64.1 to 71.9 m h(-1), and the average particle diameter increased from 0.8 to 2.3 mm. However, there was minimal variation in the heme c content. The maximum substrate removal rates in stages 1 and 2 were 4.28 and 46.38 kgN m(3) d(-1) when fitted by the Stover-Kincannon model, respectively. The results indicate that the FSABR performance was significantly enhanced compared with the CABR. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results demonstrated that R1 was successfully started-up on day 40 and had a nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of 0.55 kg N m(-3) d(-1). By contrast, it took 98 days to start up R0 (0.54 kg N m(-3) d(-1)). R0 and R1 achieved maximum NRRs of 5.70 and 12.02 kg N m(-3) d(-1), respectively. The biogranules from R1 generally possessed greater specific anammox activity (SAA), higher extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) and heme c content, larger granules and greater settling velocity. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) and high-throughput sequencing techniques were used to monitor the evolution of the bacterial community. These results demonstrated the feasibility of seeding mixed denitrifying-anammox granular sludge to start-up an anammox reactor. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

To understand the epidemiology of B19V infection in the greater metropolitan area of Hangzhou, East China, we performed surveys of IgM and IgG antibodies against B19V and quantification of B19V DNA, by using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and quantitative PCR, respectively, in plasma samples from diverse groups. These groups included anemia patients, Mycoplasma pneumonia- and Treponema pallidum-infected patients, HIV-positive individuals, and healthy blood donor volunteers. Our results demonstrated a low level of B19V IgG antibody presence, ranging from 21.9% to 41.8% in all the groups tested, suggesting a low prevalence of B19V infection in the area. Of note, we found that two healthy blood donors and one Mycoplasma pneumonia-infected patient had B19V IgM antibody among 1,290 plasma samples tested. The Mycoplasma pneumonia-infected patient had viremia with viral genome copies of 2.86x10(6) per ml of plasma. We detected a high rate of B19V DNA (7.1%) in HIV-positive injection drug users. Importantly, an amino acid mutation of P558S in the large non-structural protein NS1 was identified to be conserved among 14 B19V isolates from the HIV-positive group but not in the B19V isolate of the Mycoplasma pneumonia-infected patient, representing a hallmark of B19V isolates that circulate in HIV1-positive patients in the greater metropolitan area of Hangzhou, East China.

It is also considered as the main source of the mycotoxin patulin which can lead to serious health problems. In the present study, the effects of exogenous boric acid (BA) on virulence and patulin production of P. expansum were evaluated. The results showed that 0.3% BA significantly inhibited the development of P. expansum in vitro and resulted in lower virulence to apple fruit. Moreover, BA suppressed the metabolism of carbohydrate, lipid and protein, reduce patulin production in P. expansum. Further analysis revealed that the expressions of the majority of the 15 genes involved in patulin biosynthesis were down-regulated under BA treatment. In addition, a global view of proteome alteration of P. expansum spores in response to 0.3% BA was acquired by an iTRAQ-based (Isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation) quantitative proteomic analysis. A total of 315 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) (87 up-regulated and 228 down-regulated) were identified, and these DEPs were mainly involved in carbohydrate and protein metabolic pathways. Among them, septins and proteins related to ribosome component or ribosome biosynthesis were noticed for their significant up-regulation. Our results provided novel information for understanding the mechanism, by which BA regulated the growth of P. expansum and its virulence. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Spatiotemporal heterogeneity of environment is pervasive at multiple scales, even at scales relevant to individual plants. Clonal integration refers to resource translocation and information communication among the ramets of clonal plants. Due to clonal integration, clonal plant species possess a series of peculiar attributes: plasticity in response to local and non-local conditions, labor division with organ specialization for acquiring locally abundant resources, foraging behavior by selective placement of ramets in resource-rich microhabitats, and avoidance of intraclonal competition. Clonal integration has very profound ecological consequences for clonal plants. It allows them to efficiently cope with environmental heterogeneity, by alleviating local resource shortages, buffering environmental stresses and disturbances, influencing competitive ability, increasing invasiveness, and altering species composition and invasibility at the community level. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of research on the ecological consequences of plant clonal integration based on a large body of literature. We also attempt to propose perspectives for future research.

Despite numerous efforts have been made to improve the proofreading DNA polymerases, they are more susceptible to be failed in PCR than non-proofreading DNA polymerases. Here we showed that proofreading DNA polymerases can be inhibited by certain primers. Further analysis showed that G-rich sequences such as GGGGG and GGGGHGG can cause PCR failure using proofreading DNA polymerases but not Taq DNA polymerase. The inhibitory effect of these G-rich sequences is caused by G-quadruplex and is dose dependent. G-rich inhibitory sequence-containing primers can be used in PCR at a lower concentration to amplify its target DNA fragment.

However, the effect of central histamine on neuropathic pain is not fully understood. Here, we report a critical time window for the analgesic effect of central histamine in the partial sciatic nerve ligation model of neuropathic pain. Methods: Neuropathic pain was induced by partial sciatic nerve ligation (PSL) in rats, wild-type (C57BL/6J) mice and HDC-/- (histidine decarboxylase gene knockout) and IL-1R(-/-) (interleukin-1 receptor gene knockout) mice. Histidine, a precursor of histamine that can increase the central histamine levels, was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.). Histidine decarboxylase (HDC) enzyme inhibitor a-fluoromethylhistidine was administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.). Histamine H-1 receptor antagonist mepyramine and H-2 receptor antagonist cimetidine were given intrathecally (i.t.) and intracisternally (i.c.). Withdrawal thresholds to tactile and heat stimuli were measured with a set of von Frey hairs and infrared laser, respectively. Immunohistochemistry and Western blot were carried out to evaluate the morphology of microglia and IL-1 beta production, respectively. Results: Histidine (100 mg/kg, i.p.) administered throughout days 0-3, 0-7, or 0-14 postoperatively (PO) alleviated mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the hindpaw following PSL in rats. Intrathecal histamine reversed PSL-induced thermal hyperalgesia in a dose-dependent manner and intracisternal histamine alleviated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. Moreover, alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (i.c.v.) abrogated the analgesic effect of histidine. However, histidine treatment initiated later than the first postoperative day (treatment periods included days 2-3, 4-7, and 8-14 PO) did not show an analgesic effect. In addition, histidine treatment initiated immediately, but not 3 days after PSL, inhibited microglial activation and IL-1 beta upregulation in the lumbar spinal cord, in parallel with its effects on behavioral hypersensitivity. Moreover, the inhibitory effects on pain hypersensitivity and spinal microglial activation were absent in HDC-/- mice and IL-1R(-/-) mice. H-1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (200 ng/rat i.t. or i.c.), but not H-2 receptor antagonist cimetidine (200, 500 ng/rat i.t. or 500 ng/rat i.c.), blocked the effects of histidine on pain behavior and spinal microglia. Conclusions: These results demonstrate that central histamine is analgesic within a critical time window in the PSL model of neuropathic pain via histamine H-1 receptors. This effect may partly relate to the inhibition of microglial activation and IL-1 beta production in the spinal cord following nerve injury.

GO functionalization was primarily completed using p-aminostyrene based on condensation reaction between amino and carboxyl groups. The characterization by infrared spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy proved the covalent bonding of GO on the monolith. The average pore diameter via Barrett-Joyner-Halenda, specific surface area and pore volume via Brunauer-Emmett-Teller equation by nitrogen adsorption/desorption were determined to be 112.4 nm, 485.8 m(2) g(-1) and 1.4 cm(3) g(-1), respectively. The pAS-GO@PS-DVB monolithic column gave effective separation for a wide range of aromatic compounds, which was based on hydrogen bonding and pi-pi interactions of GO with polar and/or non-polar organic compounds. The reproducibility in terms of the precisions of migration time, peak height and peak area was estimated below 6% using thiourea and other aromatic compounds. Furthermore, the differences of migration time, peak height and peak area between the first-week analysis and the forth-week analysis were less than 19%, indicating good stability of the proposed monolithic column in one month. The applicability of the pAS-GO@PS-DVB monolith was also demonstrated by baseline separation of three phenols and three anilines. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present study, we aimed to investigate the function of trehalase (TRE) genes (TRE 1-1, TRE 1-2, and TRE-2) isolated from the brown planthopper Nilaparvata lugens, a typical piercing-sucking insect in rice, and investigate their regulating roles in chitin synthesis by injecting larvae with dsRNA. The results showed that TRE1 and TRE2 had compensatory function, and the expression of each increased when the other was silenced. The total rate of insects with phenotypic deformities ranged from 19.83 to 24.36% after dsTRE injection, whereas the mortality rate ranged from 14.16 to 31.78%. The mRNA levels of genes involved in the chitin metabolism pathway in RNA-Seq and DGEP, namely hexokinase (HK), glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (G6PI) and chitinase (Cht), decreased significantly at 72 h after single dsTREs injection, whereas two transcripts of chitin synthase (CHS) genes decreased at 72 h after dsTRE1-1 and dsTREs injection. These results demonstrated that TRE silencing could affect the regulation of chitin biosynthesis and degradation, causing moulting deformities. Therefore, expression inhibitors of TREs might be effective tools for the control of planthoppers in rice.

Observation of h(c) Radiative Decay h(c) -> gamma eta ' and Evidence for h(c) -> gamma eta	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article								A search for radiative decays of the P-wave spin singlet charmonium resonance h(c) is performed based on 4.48 x 10(8) psi' events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring. Events of the reaction channels h(c) -> gamma eta' and gamma eta are observed with a statistical significance of 8.4 sigma and 4.0 sigma, respectively, for the first time. The branching fractions of h(c) -> gamma eta' and h(c) -> gamma eta' are measured to be B(h(c) -> gamma eta') = (1.52 +/- 0.27 +/- 0.29) x 10(-3) and B(h(c) -> gamma eta) = (4.7 +/- 1.5 +/- 1.4) x 10(-4), respectively, where the first errors are statistical and the second are systematic uncertainties.

The linear MR decreases with increasing temperature, but it is still as large as 61% under mu H-0 of 15 T at room temperature. Such a giant linear MR is unlikely to be described by the quantum model as the quantum condition is not satisfied. Instead, we found that the slope of MR scales with the Hall mobility, and it can be well explained by a classical disorder model. Published by AIP Publishing.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of pseudoscalar and tensor resonances in J/psi -> gamma phi phi	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							GLUEBALL-ENHANCED CHANNEL; RADIATIVE DECAYS; MESONS; STATISTICS; SYSTEM; STATE; GEV/C	Based on a sample of (1310.6 +/- 10.5) x 10(6) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, a partial wave analysis of the decay J/psi -> gamma phi phi is performed in order to study the intermediate states. Results of the partial wave analysis show that the structures are predominantly 0(-+) states. The existence of the eta(2225) is confirmed, and its resonance parameters are measured. Two additional pseudoscalar states, the eta(2100) with a mass of 2050(-24-26)(+30+75) MeV/c(2) and a width of 250(-30-164)(+36+181) MeV/c(2) and the X(2500) with a mass of 2470(-19-23)(+15+101) MeV/c(2) and a width of 230(-35-33)(+64+56) MeV/c(2), are observed. In addition to these three pseudoscalar states, the scalar state f(0)(2100), and three tensor states, the f(2)(2010), f(2)(2300) and f(2)(2340), are observed in the process J/psi -> gamma phi phi The product branching fractions B(J/psi -> gamma X) x B(X -> phi phi) are reported.

It is unclear when and how inhibitory neurons express distinct structural and functional profiles. Using in vivo time-lapse imaging of tectal neuron structure and visually evoked Ca2+ responses in tadpoles, we found that inhibitory neurons cluster into two groups with opposite valence of plasticity after 4 hr of dark and visual stimulation. Half decreased dendritic arbor size and Ca2+ responses after dark and increased them after visual stimulation, matching plasticity in excitatory neurons. Half increased dendrite arbor size and Ca2+ responses following dark and decreased them after stimulation. At the circuit level, visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs were potentiated by visual experience and E/I remained constant. Our results indicate that developing inhibitory neurons fall into distinct functional groups with opposite experience-dependent plasticity and as such, are well positioned to foster experience-dependent synaptic plasticity and maintain circuit stability during labile periods of circuit development.

In this study, simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers were generated from EST datasets and were applied to assess the genetic diversity among 32 cultivars. A total of 218 in silico SSR loci were identified from 7300 C. monfolium ESTs retrieved from GenBank. Of all SSR loci, 61.47% of them (134) were hexa-nucleotide repeats, followed by tri-nucleotide repeats (17.89%), di-nucleotide repeats (12.39%), tetra-nucleotide repeats (4.13%), and penta-nucleotide repeats (4.13%). In this study, 17 novel EST-SSR markers were verified. Along with 38 SSR markers reported previously, 55 C. morifolium SSR markers were selected for further genetic diversity analysis. PCR amplification of these EST-SSRs produced 1319 fragments, 1306 of which showed polymorphism. The average polymorphism information content of the SSR primer pairs was 0.972 (0.938-0.993), which showed high genetic diversity among C. morifolium cultivars. Based on SSR markers, 32 C. morifolium cultivars were separated into two main groups by partitioning of the clusters using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean dendrogram, which was further supported by a principal coordinate analysis plot. Phylogenetic relationship among C. morifolium cultivars as revealed by SSR markers was highly consistent with the classification of medicinal C. morifolium populations according to their origin and ecological distribution. Our results demonstrated that SSR markers were highly reproducible and informative, and could be used to evaluate genetic diversity and relationships among medicinal C. morifolium cultivars.

It reduces cognitive function and increases the burden on caregivers. Currently, there are very few medications that are useful for treating depression in AD patients. Therefore, understanding the brain abnormalities in AD patients with depression (D-AD) is crucial for developing effective interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate the intrinsic dysconnectivity pattern of whole-brain functional networks at the voxel level in D-AD patients based on degree centrality (DC) as measured by resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (R-fMRI). Our study included 32 AD patients. All patients were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and further divided into two groups: 15 D-AD patients and 17 non-depressed AD (nD-AD) patients. R-fMRI datasets were acquired from these D-AD and nD-AD patients. First, we performed a DC analysis to identify voxels that showed altered whole brain functional connectivity (FC) with other voxels. We then further investigated FC using the abnormal DC regions to examine in more detail the connectivity patterns of the identified DC changes. D-AD patients had lower DC values in the right middle frontal, precentral, and postcentral gyrus than nD-AD patients. Seed-based analysis revealed decreased connectivity between the precentral and postcentral gyrus to the supplementary motor area and middle cingulum. FC also decreased in the right middle frontal, precentral, and postcentral gyrus. Thus, AD patients with depression fit a 'network dysfunction model' distinct from major depressive disorder and AD.

Results of a confirmatory factor analysis show that place attachment consists of four major factors: place identity, place dependence, affective attachment, and social bonding. Estimation results also reveal differences in the importance of place attachment constructs between Chinese and Western tourists.

However, the interactions of MCD with CoA derivatives are not well understood owing to unavailable crystal structure with a complete occupancy in the active site. To identify the active site of MCD, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations were performed to explore the interactions of human mitochondrial MCD (HmMCD) and CoA derivatives. The findings reveal that the active site of HmMCD indeed resides in the prominent groove which resembles that of CurA. However, the binding modes are slightly different from the one observed in CurA due to the occupancy of the side chain of Lys183 from the N-terminal helical domain instead of the adenine ring of CoA. The residues 3002305 play an essential role in maintaining the stability of complex mainly through hydrogen bond interactions with the pyrophosphate moiety of acetyl-CoA. Principle component analysis elucidates the conformational distribution and dominant concerted motions of HmMCD. MM_PBSA calculations present the crucial residues and the major driving force responsible for the binding of acetyl-CoA. These results provide useful information for understanding the interactions of HmMCD with CoA derivatives. (C) 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Mn and Cu are codoped into the same Zn sites to provide local moments and carriers, respectively. A ferromagnetic transition with the highest T-C of similar to 8K has been observed for x = 0.150 from magnetization measurements. Iso-thermal magnetization plots show that the compound has a coercive field, similar to 500 Oe, much smaller than that in (La,Ba)(Zn, Mn) AsO.

By explicating the three symbolic discourses in the poem, which are, "Hair", "Spirits" and "Lover", the paper comes to argue that "Hair" is endowed with social implications, satirizing the perverted and corrupted ethical values of the upper class then; "Spirits" indicate the levity, coquettishness and hypocrisy of Belinda and her pride, intemperance and extremeness in relation to morality; and "Lover" suggests the confusion and degeneration of the ethical values of Belinda and her upper class kinsman. In virtue of the creative power of the poetic language, the author embeds aesthetic taste and instruction in the de-familiarized language, making readers unconsciously identify with the notion of order and the pursuit for reason.

The smoothness of the graft is one of the important aspects in the arterial graft design problem since it affects the flow of the blood significantly. As an attractive design tool for this problem, level set methods are quite efficient for obtaining better shape of the graft. In this paper, a cubic spline level set method and a radial basis function level set method are designed to solve the arterial graft design problem. In both approaches, the shape of the arterial graft is implicitly tracked by the zero-level contour of a level set function and a high level of smoothness of the graft is achieved. Numerical results show the efficiency of the algorithms in the arterial graft design.

The results showed that vermicomposting led to higher pH, TC, and available P but lower EC, TN, available N, and available K in the substrate residues compared with natural composting; the total or available Cu/Zn content in the substrate residues similarly increased after composting or vermicomposting, but Cu was easily enriched in earthworm bodies and its intestinal vermicompost while vermicomposting enhanced the formation of dissolved Zn in DOM; moreover, much more fulvic and humic acid-like materials and much greater aromaticity were exhibited in DOM obtained from vermicomposting residues compared with DOM from composting residues, which may contribute to the variations of Cu/Zn enrichment in earthworms and its migration to the vermicomposting residues or its DOM.

The molecular mechanism that controls the two aspects remains unclear in rice. In the present study, we characterized a rice gene, ABNORMAL FLOWER AND DWARF1 (AFD1) that determined plant height, floral development and grain yield. The afd1 mutant showed variable defects including the dwarfism, long panicle, low seed setting and reduced grain yield. In addition, abnormal floral organs were also observed in the afd1 mutant including slender and thick hulls, and hull-like lodicules. AFD1 encoded a DUF640 domain protein and was expressed in all tested tissues and organs. Subcellular localization showed AFD1-green fluorescent fusion protein (GFP) was localized in the nucleus. Meantime, our results suggested that AFD1 regulated the expression of cell division and expansion related genes.

Strong but diverging clonality climate relationships of different plant clades explain weak overall pattern across China	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; SPECIES RICHNESS; TRANS-HIMALAYA; BIOGEOGRAPHY; ECOLOGY; LADAKH	The clonal strategy should be relatively important in stressful environments (i.e. of low resource availability or harsh climate), e.g. in cold habitats. However, our understanding of the distribution pattern of clonality along environmental gradients is still far from universal. The weakness and inconsistency of overall clonality-climate relationships across taxa, as reported in previous studies, may be due to different phylogenetic lineages having fundamental differences in functional traits other than clonality determining their climate response. Thus, in this study we compared the clonality-climate relationships along a latitudinal gradient within and between different lineages at several taxonomic levels, including four major angiosperm lineages (Magnoliidae, Monocotyledoneae, Superrosidae and Superasteridae), orders and families. To this aim we used a species clonality dataset for 4015 vascular plant species in 545 terrestrial communities across China. Our results revealed clear predictive patterns of clonality proportion in relation to environmental gradients for the predominant representatives of each of the taxonomic levels above, but the relationships differed in shape and strength between the 4 major angiosperm lineages, between the 12 orders and between the 12 families. These different relationships canceled out one another when all lineages at a certain taxonomic level were pooled. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly accounting for the functional or taxonomic scale for studying variation in plant ecological strategy across environmental gradients.

However, the neural substrates underlying the WM processing of BM remain largely unknown. Employing the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, the current study directly investigated this issue. We used point-light BM animations as the tested stimuli, and explored the neural substrates involved in encoding and retaining BM information in WM. Participants were required to remember two or four BM stimuli in a change-detection task. We first defined a set of potential brain regions devoted to the BM processing in WM in one experiment. We then conducted the second fMRI experiment, and performed time course analysis over the pre-defined regions, which allowed us to differentiate the encoding and maintenance phases of WM. The results showed that a set of brain regions were involved in encoding BM into WM, including the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal sulcus, fusiform gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus. However, only the middle frontal gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, and inferior parietal lobule were involved in retaining BM into WM. These results suggest that an overlapped network exists between the WM encoding and maintenance for BM; however, retaining BM in WM predominately relies on the mirror neuron system.

Because of their functional nature, in general, most of their parts or sites are differently constrained selectively, particularly by purifying selection. Most previous studies on protein evolution considered individual proteins in their entirety or compared protein-coding sequences with non-coding sequences. Less attention has been paid to the evolution of different parts within each protein of a given genome. To this end, based on PfamA annotation of all human proteins, each protein sequence can be split into two parts: domains or unassigned regions. Using this rationale, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in protein-coding sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project were mapped according to two classifications: SNPs occurring within protein domains and those within unassigned regions. With these classifications, we found: the density of synonymous SNPs within domains is significantly greater than that of synonymous SNPs within unassigned regions; however, the density of non-synonymous SNPs shows the opposite pattern. We also found there are signatures of purifying selection on both the domain and unassigned regions. Furthermore, the selective strength on domains is significantly greater than that on unassigned regions. In addition, among all of the human protein sequences, there are 117 PfamA domains in which no SNPs are found. Our results highlight an important aspect of protein domains and may contribute to our understanding of protein evolution.

However, whether ethyl pyruvate attenuates early brain injury after subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) remains unknown. This study was conducted to investigate the potential effects of ethyl pyruvate on early brain injury induced by SAH and explore the underlying mechanisms. Eighty-eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. An SAH model was induced by endovascular perforation. Ethyl pyruvate (100 mg/kg) or a vehicle was administered intraperitoneally at 1 h after SAH induction. SAH grade, neurological scores, brain water content, Evans blue extravasation, Western blots, and immunofluorescence were used to study the mechanisms of ethyl pyruvate. Ethyl pyruvate treatment inhibited microglia activation and reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha). Ethyl pyruvate treatment also prevented disruption of tight junction proteins (occluding and claudin-5) and reduced expression of MMP-9. In addition, ethyl pyruvate treatment markedly reduced TUNEL-positive cells and expression of cleaved caspase-3. Our results indicated that ethyl pyruvate treatment attenuated early brain injury and improved neurological function after SAH by inhibiting microglia activation and apoptosis and stabilizing the BBB.

The polymer-particle interaction is treated as Lennard-Jones potential with strength epsilon (PP). The critical adsorption point epsilon (*) (PP) is estimated from the largest fluctuation of the number of monomers contacted with particle. We find that epsilon (*) (PP) is dependent on the comparison between particle size sigma (p) and R (G0), the mean radius of gyration of polymer in dilute solution. epsilon (*) (PP) decreases with an increase in sigma (p) at sigma (p) < R (G0) and is independent of sigma (p) at sigma (p) a parts per thousand yen R (G0). The polymer starts to be adsorbed on particle, and the mean contact time begins to increase at epsilon (*) (PP). In addition, the structural property characterized by trains, loops, and tails is investigated for polymer contacted with particle. Results show that the structure is dependent on the interaction strength epsilon (pp). We find that both the number of monomers contacted with the particle and the length of trains increase with epsilon (pp), whereas lengths of tail and loop decrease with the increase in epsilon (pp).

As most studies on this are from the laboratory, there is a need for replicated studies in wild animals. This study aims to examine the effects of density stress during the maternal period and adulthood on immune traits of root vole (Microtus oeconomus) individuals. Four replicated high- and low-density parental populations were established, from which we obtained offspring and assigned each into four enclosures, two for each of the two density treatments used in establishing parental populations. The F1 offspring fecal corticosterone metabolite response to acute immobilization stress, anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin immunoglobulin G (anti-KLH IgG) level, phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-delayed hypersensitivity and hematology at the end of the first breeding season, and prevalence and intensity of coccidial infection throughout the two breeding seasons, were tested. Density-induced maternally stressed offspring had delayed responses to acute immobilization stress. Density-stressed offspring as adults had reduced anti-KLH IgG levels and PHA responses, and the effects further deteriorated in maternally stressed offspring, leading to higher coccidial infection in the first breeding season than in the second. No correlations were found between immune traits or coccidial infection and survival over winter. These findings indicated that the combined density stresses during the maternal period and adulthood exhibited negative synergistic effects on immune traits. The synergistic effects lead to higher coccidial infection; however, this consequently reduced the risk of subsequent infection. The increased coccidial infection mediated by the synergistic effects may have an adaptive value in the context of the environment.

J	Zhou, QQ; Zhang, CZ; Zhao, SX; Chen, BK				Zhou, Qingqing; Zhang, Chengzhi; Zhao, Star X.; Chen, Bikun			Measuring book impact based on the multi-granularity online review mining	SCIENTOMETRICS			English	Review						Online book reviews; Sentiment analysis; Book citation; Information content; Altmetrics	CITATIONS; ALTMETRICS	As with articles and journals, the customary methods for measuring books' academic impact mainly involve citations, which is easy but limited to interrogating traditional citation databases and scholarly book reviews. Researchers have attempted to use other metrics, such as Google Books, libcitation, and publisher prestige. However, these approaches lack content-level information and cannot determine the citation intentions of users. Meanwhile, the abundant online review resources concerning academic books can be used to mine deeper information and content utilizing altmetric perspectives. In this study, we measure the impacts of academic books by multi-granularity mining online reviews, and we identify factors that affect a book's impact. First, online reviews of a sample of academic books on Amazon.cn are crawled and processed. Then, multi-granularity review mining is conducted to identify review sentiment polarities and aspects' sentiment values. Lastly, the numbers of positive reviews and negative reviews, aspect sentiment values, star values, and information regarding helpfulness are integrated via the entropy method, and lead to the calculation of the final book impact scores. The results of a correlation analysis of book impact scores obtained via our method versus traditional book citations show that, although there are substantial differences between subject areas, online book reviews tend to reflect the academic impact. Thus, we infer that online reviews represent a promising source for mining book impact within the altmetric perspective and at the multi-granularity content level. Moreover, our proposed method might also be a means by which to measure other books besides academic publications.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurements of the center-of-mass energies at BESIII via the di-muon process	CHINESE PHYSICS C			English	Article						center-of-mass energy; di-muon process; charmoniumlike states	RADIATIVE-CORRECTIONS	From 2011 to 2014, the BESIII experiment collected about 5 fb(-1) data at center-of-mass energies around 4 GeV for the studies of the charmonium-like and higher excited charmonium states. By analyzing the di-muon process e(+)e(-)->gamma ISR/FSR mu(+)mu(-), the center-of-mass energies of the data samples are measured with a precision of 0.8 MeV. The center-of-mass energy is found to be stable for most of the time during data taking.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H.

In this study, we evaluated the enantioselective toxicity of rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl to zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos through various malformations including pericardial edema, yolk sac edema, crooked body, and short tails. The results showed that there were significant differences in toxicity to zebrafish embryos caused by rac-metalaxyl and R-metalaxyl, and the LC(50)s at 96 h are 416.41 (353.91, 499.29) mgL(-1) and 320.650 (279.80, 363.46) mgL(-1), respectively. In order to explore the possible mechanism of the development defects, the genes involved in the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (vtg1, vtg2, cyp17, cyp19a, cyp19b) and hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis (dio1, dio2, nis, tg, tpo) were quantified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The results revealed that there were no significant differences in the expression of vtg1, vtg2, cyp17, cyp19a, and cyp19b after exposure to rac-metalaxyl. However, the expression of vtg1, cyp19a, and cyp19b decreased significantly after exposure to R-metalaxyl. And likewise, rac-metalaxyl only caused the upregulation of dio2, while R-metalaxyl suppressed the expression of dio1 and tpo and induced the expression of dio2 and nis. The change of gene expression may cause the enantioselectivity in developmental toxicity in zebrafish embryo.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are the most primitive cell type in the hematopoietic system. They divide asymmetrically and give rise to daughter cells with HSC identity (self-renewal) and progenitor progenies (differentiation), which further proliferate and differentiate into full hematopoietic lineages. Mammalian ageing process is accompanied with abnormalities in the HSC self-renewal and differentiation. Transcriptional changes and epigenetic modulations have been implicated as the key regulators in HSC ageing process. The DNA damage response (DDR) in the cells involves an orchestrated signaling pathway, consisting of cell cycle regulation, cell death and senescence, transcriptional regulation, as well as chromatin remodeling. Recent studies employing DNA repair-deficient mouse models indicate that DDR could intrinsically and extrinsically regulate HSC maintenance and play important roles in tissue homeostasis of the hematopoietic system. In this review, we summarize the current understanding of how the DDR determines the HSC fates and finally contributes to organismal ageing.

JOURNAL OF CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW AND METABOLISM			English	Article						Resting state; glymphatics; magnetic resonance encephalography; cardiorespiratory; blood oxygen level dependent	RESTING-STATE FMRI; SPATIOTEMPORAL DYNAMICS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ARTERIAL PULSATION; POWER SPECTRUM; HEART-RATE; FLUCTUATIONS; EEG; NOISE; CLEARANCE	The theory on the glymphatic convection mechanism of cerebrospinal fluid holds that cardiac pulsations in part pump cerebrospinal fluid from the peri-arterial spaces through the extracellular tissue into the peri-venous spaces facilitated by aquaporin water channels. Since cardiac pulses cannot be the sole mechanism of glymphatic propulsion, we searched for additional cerebrospinal fluid pulsations in the human brain with ultra-fast magnetic resonance encephalography. We detected three types of physiological mechanisms affecting cerebral cerebrospinal fluid pulsations: cardiac, respiratory, and very low frequency pulsations. The cardiac pulsations induce a negative magnetic resonance encephalography signal change in peri-arterial regions that extends centrifugally and covers the brain in approximate to 1 Hz cycles. The respiratory approximate to 0.3 Hz pulsations are centripetal periodical pulses that occur dominantly in peri-venous areas. The third type of pulsation was very low frequency (VLF 0.001-0.023 Hz) and low frequency (LF 0.023-0.73 Hz) waves that both propagate with unique spatiotemporal patterns. Our findings using critically sampled magnetic resonance encephalography open a new view into cerebral fluid dynamics. Since glymphatic system failure may precede protein accumulations in diseases such as Alzheimer's dementia, this methodological advance offers a novel approach to image brain fluid dynamics that potentially can enable early detection and intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.

Using tourist survey data collected in Hangzhou, China, a historical city, we estimate two structural equation models one for Western tourists and one for domestic tourists. The results suggest that although place attachment is a significant antecedent of destination loyalty, its impact is smaller than that of tourist satisfaction. Moreover, activity involvement, satisfaction, perceived attractiveness, and motivation are statistically significant in shaping tourists' place attachment. Differences in the model estimates for the Western and domestic subsamples can be attributed to cultural differentes. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This is usually achieved through interactions between viral proteins and host factors. Geminiviruses are a group of plant-infecting DNA viruses, of which some contain a betasatellite, known as DNA beta. Here, we report that Cotton leaf curl Multan virus (CLCuMuV) uses its sole satellite-encoded protein beta C1 to regulate the plant ubiquitination pathway for effective infection. We found that CLCuMu betasatellite (CLCuMuB) beta C1 interacts with NbSKP1, and interrupts the interaction of NbSKP1s with NbCUL1. Silencing of either NbSKP1s or NbCUL1 enhances the accumulation of CLCuMuV genomic DNA and results in severe disease symptoms in plants. beta C1 impairs the integrity of SCFCOI1 and the stabilization of GAI, a substrate of the SCFSYL1 to hinder responses to jasmonates (JA) and gibberellins (GA). Moreover, JA treatment reduces viral accumulation and symptoms. These results suggest that CLCuMuB beta C1 inhibits the ubiquitination function of SCF E3 ligases through interacting with NbSKP1s to enhance CLCuMuV infection and symptom induction in plants.

Recent studies have revealed the impaired homeostatic functions of reactive astrocytes, which were thought to facilitate the development of seizures. However, how this phenotype of reactive astrocytes is regulated remains unclear. Here, using pentylenete-trazole (PTZ)-kindling model, we investigated the roles of reactive astrocytes and their intracellular Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the ischemia-increased seizure susceptibility. Our data showed that somatosensory cortical ischemia significantly increased the susceptibility to PTZ-induced seizure. Genetic ablation of Nestin-positive reactive astrocytes significantly decreased the incidence and severity of seizures. By using a Wnt signaling reporter mice line Topgal mice, we found that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling was upregulated in reactive astrocytes after ischemia. Depletion of beta-catenin in reactive astrocytes significantly decreased the susceptibility of seizures and the expression of c-Fos induced by PTZ in the ischemic cortex. Overexpression of beta-catenin in reactive astrocytes, in contrast, significantly increased seizure susceptibility and the expression of c-Fos. Furthermore, the expression of aquaporin-4 (AQP-4) and inwardly rectifying K 1 channel 4.1 (Kir4.1), two molecules reportedly associated with seizure development, was oppositely affected in reactive astrocytes with beta-catenin depletion or overexpression. Taken together, these data indicated that astrocytic Wnt/beta-catenin signaling accounts, at least partially, for the ischemia-increased seizure susceptibility. Inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling may be utilized in the future for preventing postischemic seizures.

J	Mao, F; Ji, MH; Liu, T				Mao, Feng; Ji, Minhe; Liu, Ting			Mining spatiotemporal patterns of urban dwellers from taxi trajectory data	FRONTIERS OF EARTH SCIENCE			English	Article						taxi trajectory; spatial clustering; spatiotemporal pattern mining	MODEL	With the widespread adoption of locationaware technology, obtaining long-sequence, massive and high-accuracy spatiotemporal trajectory data of individuals has become increasingly popular in various geographic studies. Trajectory data of taxis, one of the most widely used inner-city travel modes, contain rich information about both road network traffic and travel behavior of passengers. Such data can be used to study the microscopic activity patterns of individuals as well as the macro system of urban spatial structures. This paper focuses on trajectories obtained from GPS-enabled taxis and their applications for mining urban commuting patterns. A novel approach is proposed to discover spatiotemporal patterns of household travel from the taxi trajectory dataset with a large number of point locations. The approach involves three critical steps: spatial clustering of taxi origin-destination (OD) based on urban traffic grids to discover potentially meaningful places, identifying threshold values from statistics of the OD clusters to extract urban jobs-housing structures, and visualization of analytic results to understand the spatial distribution and temporal trends of the revealed urban structures and implied household commuting behavior. A case study with a taxi trajectory dataset in Shanghai, China is presented to demonstrate and evaluate the proposed method.

A popular hypothesis is that procrastination is representative of self-regulatory failure. Although there is extensive behavioral evidence consistent with the predictions of this theory, there is no neural evidence for it. To test directly the extent to which individual differences in trait procrastination can be related to resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) between brain regions implicated in self-regulation, we applied resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) in a group of 77 healthy participants. RSFC 1) between ventral medial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC) and dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), 2) between dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and caudate, and 3) within ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), negatively predicted the severity of procrastination. These results provide direct evidence for the validity of self-regulatory failure account of procrastination, and implicate that trait procrastination is reflected in the intrinsic functional dynamics of neural systems associated with impulse control, performance monitoring, and behavioral inhibition.

Compared with the widely used Pearson coefficient, Spearman coefficient is rank-based, nonparametric, and size-independent. Thus it is more effective to assess linking patterns of diverse networks, especially for large-size networks. We demonstrate this pointby testing a variety of empirical and artificial networks. Moreover, we show that normalized Spearman ranks of stubs are subject to an interesting linear rule where the correlation coefficient is just the Spearman coefficient. This compelling linear relationship allows us to directly produce networks with any prescribed Spearman coefficient. Our method apparently has an edge over the well known uncorrelated configuration model. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Olig1 is a basic helix loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor generally used as a lineage tool for oligodendrocyte research in spinal cord. Recent studies have revealed a property of Olig1-positive cells as the common progenitors of GABAergic neurons and oligodendrocytes in the forebrain during embryogenesis, and a stage-dependent regulatory role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the differentiation of oligodendrocytes in spinal cord. Given the neurogenic role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in neural progenitor cells, it is unclear how P-catenin affects the differentiation of Olig1-positive progenitors in brain. In the present study, we investigated the effects of P-catenin over-expression on the differentiation of Olig1-positive progenitors in the forebrain cortex, by using Olig1-Cre:beta-cateninEX3(loxp/+):ROSA-YFP (beta-cateninEX3 CKO) mice as compared to Olig1-Cre:ROSA-YFP control. The results showed that in the cortex of Olig1-Cre:ROSA-YFP mice, approximately 28.6% of YFP labeled cells are GFAP-positive, 43.7% are NG2-positive, 23.4% are CC1-positive and 3.2% are NeuN-positive, showing that Olig1-positive cells are multi-potential and mainly gliogenic. However, in the cortex of beta-cateninEX3 CKO mice, the percentage of astrocytes generated from Olig1-positive cells decreased dramatically to approximately 2%, NG2-positive cells to 0.4%, and CC1-positive cells to 0.5%. In contrast, the percentage of NeuN-positive cells increased to approximately 96% of YFP-labeled cells. Taken together, our data showed that the gliogenic property of Olig1-positive progenitors in forebrain can be efficiently switched to neurogenic by over-expressing beta-catenin, revealing a neurogenic effect of beta-catenin in the forebrain Olig1-positive progenitors.

Proper embryo development ensure viable seed formation. Here, we showed an Arabidopsis T-DNA insertion mutant slow embryo development1 (sed1) which exhibited retarded embryogenesis, led to aborted seeds. Embryo without SED1 developed slower compared to normal one and could be recognized at early globular stage by its white appearance. In later development stage, storage accumulated poorly with less protein and lipid body production. In vitro culture did not rescue albino embryo. SED1 encoded a protein targeted to mitochondria. Transmission electron microscopic analysis revealed that mitochondria developed abnormally, and more strikingly plastid failed to construct grana in time in sed1/sed1 embryo. These data indicated that SED1 is indispensable for embryogenesis in Arabidopsis, and the mitochondria may be involved in the regulation of many aspects of seed development. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Denoising is critical for HFO studies. Previous work indicated that head motion (HM) has remarkable influences on a variety of rs-fMRI metrics, but its influences on rs-fMRI HFOs are still unknown. In this study, we investigated the impacts of HM regression (HMR) on HFO results using a fast sampling rs-fMRI dataset. We demonstrated that apparent high-frequency (similar to 0.2-0.4 Hz) components existed in the HM trajectories in almost all subjects. In addition, we found that individual-level HMR could robustly reveal more between-condition (eye-open vs. eye-closed) amplitude differences in high-frequency bands. Although regression of mean framewise displacement (FD) at the group level had little impact on the results, mean FD could significantly account for inter-subject variance of HFOs even after individual-level HMR. Our findings suggest that HM artifacts should not be ignored in HFO studies, and HMR is necessary for detecting HFO between-condition differences.

We find that the stacking geometries and interlayer distances significantly affect the electronic structure of G/h-BN systems. By studying four stacking geometries, we conclude that the monolayer G/h-BN systems should possess metallic electronic properties. The monolayer G/h-BN systems can be transited from metallicity to semiconductor by increasing h-BN layers. It reveals that the alteration of interlayer distances 2.50-3.50 angstrom can obtain the metal semiconductor semimetal variation and a tunable band gap for G/h-BN composite systems. The band dispersion along K-H direction is analogous to the band of rhombohedral graphite when the G/h-BN systems are semiconducting.

J	Du, RJ; Dong, GG; Tian, LX; Liu, RR				Du, Ruijin; Dong, Gaogao; Tian, Lixin; Liu, Runran			Targeted attack on networks coupled by connectivity and dependency links	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Targeted attack; Coupled network; Percolation	ROBUSTNESS	Coupled systems used to increase capacity were shown beneficial as long as it does not open pathways to cascades. Previous studies on the robustness of coupled networks except for interdependent networks are almost the cases of random attack. Many challenges remain exist in targeted-attack problem of coupled networks. Since nodes within coupled networks show different functions for each network, this paper both analytically and numerically analyzed the robustness of coupled networks under three types of targeted attacking strategies, including attacking on nodes by considering internal and external degree, internal degree only, and external degree only. For coupled network with both interdependent and interconnected links, all degree distributions of intra- and inter connectivity links are Poissonian, we find the system undergoes from second to first order phase transition as coupling strength q increases. The fraction of nodes in the giant component P-infinity at stable state, the critical phase transition threshold p(c) (first order threshold p(c)(I) and second order threshold p(c)(II)), and the critical point (p(c), q(c)) separating the first and second order phase transitions are analytically obtained for three types of attacking strategies with attacking probability parameter alpha = 0,1. We also find the system becomes more vulnerable as the average degree of intra-links (k) over bar or inter-links (K) over bar decreases. Therefore, the minimum average degrees (k) over bar (min) and (K) over bar (min) to maintain the system stable are obtained for the case of alpha = 0,1. Moreover, we discussed three typical cases of coupled networks, interdependent networks ((K) over bar = 0), interacting networks (q = 0) and bipartite network (k = 0, q = 0), the analytical expressions of P-infinity, p(c) and (p(c), q(c)) (only for interdependent) are given respectively. Besides, we study the equivalence relations between interdependent networks and coupled networks with connectivity and dependency links for the same p(c). The results imply that we can adjust the parameters q, (k) over bar and (K) over bar to make the two systems have the same robustness. Moreover, the results imply that one should not only protect nodes with high degree of intra-links or inter-links, but also defend nodes, the sum of whose degree of intra-links and inter-links is big, can avoid the system becoming vulnerable.

According to analysis of variance and response surface analyses, the experiment data were excellently fitted to the quadratic model. The corresponding optimal parameters of adsorption process are listed as following: temperature at 35 degrees C, initial pH of 6.57, and initial Ni(II) concentration of 0.33mg/mL. Under optimum adsorption conditions, the adsorption capacity of Ni(II) was 188.5mg/g, in well accordance with the predicted value by the model (192.88mg/g). The adsorption kinetics and equilibrium data were well fitted to the pseudo-second-order model and the Langmuir isotherm model, respectively. Thermodynamic parameters (G, S, and H) suggested that the adsorption process was endothermic and spontaneous in nature. Desorption study revealed that Ni(II) can be effectively eluted by 2.0mol/L HCl solution, and the recovery was 100%. The characterization by Fourier Transform infrared and SEM was performed. Meanwhile, the 110-H resin has been successfully applied in the removal of Ni(II) in natural water samples with satisfactory results.

Interleukin-5 (IL-5) is a cytokine regulating interactions between immune cells. It also activates the production of T15/EO6 IgM antibodies in B-1 cells, which can bind oxLDL thereby demonstrating anti-atherogenic properties. We previously reported that inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) by mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases 1/2 (MEK1/2) inhibitors can reduce atherosclerosis. In this study, we determined the effects of MEK1/2 inhibitors on IL-5 production both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, MEK1/2 inhibitors (PD98059 and U0126) substantially inhibited phosphorylation of MEK1/2 and ERK1/2. Associated with inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation both in vitro and in vivo, MEK1/2 inhibitors induced IL-5 protein expression in macrophages (RAW macrophages and peritoneal macrophages) and lymphocytes (EL-4 cells). In vivo, administration of mice with MEK1/2 inhibitors increased serum IL-5 levels, and IL-5 protein expression in mouse spleen and liver. At the mechanistic level, we determined that MEK1/2 inhibitors activated IL-5 mRNA expression and IL-5 promoter activity in the liver X receptor (LXR) dependent manner indicating the induction of IL-5 transcription. In addition, we determined that MEK1/2 inhibitors enhanced IL-5 protein stability. Taken together, our study demonstrates that MEK1/2 inhibitors induce IL-5 production which suggests another anti-atherogenic mechanism of MEK1/2 inhibitors. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Compounds 8 and 9 are separated by column chromatography and characterized by NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography. Detailed investigation of the reaction has revealed that the initial product is 8, which isomerizes to 9 irreversibly under the catalytic influence of 1 as a Lewis acid. The above view is supported by the theoretical DFT calculations. Treatment of 1 with ArN=C=O [Ar = 2,6-iPr(2)C(6)H(3)] affords the corresponding carbamoyl(hydroxyl)stannane 11 via the hydrolysis of the corresponding silaaziridinone formed by the [1 + 2] cycloaddition reaction of 1 with the N=C double bond of the isocyanate. Stannylene 1 reacts with ArN=C=S, giving a mixture of complex products, while 1 does not react with CO2.

Although exposure to triazole fungicides is associated with reproductive toxicity in mammals, limited information is available regarding the effects of triazole fungicides on human placental trophoblast function. Tebuconazole (TEB) is a common triazole fungicide that has been extensively used for fungi control. In this work, we showed that TEB could reduce cell viability, disturb normal cell cycle distribution and induce apoptosis of human placental trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo (HTR-8). Bcl-2 protein expression decreased and the level of Bax protein increased after TEB treatment in HTR-8 cells. The results demonstrated that this fungicide induced apoptosis of trophoblast cells via mitochondrial pathway. Importantly, we found that the invasive and migratory capacities of HTR-8 cells decreased significantly after TEB administration. TEB altered the expression of key regulatory genes involved in the modulation of trophoblast functions. Taken together, TEB suppressed human trophoblast invasion and migration through affecting the expression of protease, hormones, angiogenic factors, growth factors and cytokines. As the invasive and migratory abilities of trophoblast are essential for successful placentation and fetus development, our findings suggest a potential risk of triazole fungicides to human pregnancy.

The microstructure, luminescence, and magnetic properties of the codoped samples were investigated and discussed with the help of various analytic techniques including X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, photo-luminescence spectra, cathodelumincence mapping and vibrating sample magnetometer. The co-doped sample (x = 0.3), emitting at 612 nm dominantly under the 254 nm excitation, exhibited the photoluminescence intensity 2.7 times higher than the undoped one (x = 0), due to the efficient energy transfer between Gd3+ and Eu3+. The Fe3O4@(Y1-xGdx)(2)O-3: Eu3+ core-shell nanoparticles were spherical and uniform, and had a particle size of about 180 nm in diameter. They also showed a saturation magnetization of 1.09 emu/g, a coercivity of 20 Oe and a remanence of 0.01emu/g. The enhanced photoluminescence and good magnetic properties of the title core-shell nanocomposites allow them to be used in biomedical applications. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Plasticity of functional traits allows clonal plants to regulate their resource allocation to meet changing environments. In this study, biomass allocation traits of clonal plants were categorized into absolute biomass for vegetative growth vs. for reproduction, and their relative ratios based on a data set including 115 species and derived from 139 published literatures. We examined general pattern of biomass allocation of clonal plants in response to availabilities of resource (e.g., light, nutrients, and water) using phylogenetic meta-analysis. We also tested whether the pattern differed among clonal organ types (stolon vs. rhizome). Overall, we found that stoloniferous plants were more sensitive to light intensity than rhizomatous plants, preferentially allocating biomass to vegetative growth, aboveground part and clonal reproduction under shaded conditions. Under nutrient- and water-poor condition, rhizomatous plants were constrained more by ontogeny than by resource availability, preferentially allocating biomass to belowground part. Biomass allocation between belowground and aboveground part of clonal plants generally supported the optimal allocation theory. No general pattern of trade-off was found between growth and reproduction, and neither between sexual and clonal reproduction. Using phylogenetic meta-analysis can avoid possible confounding effects of phylogeny on the results. Our results shown the optimal allocation theory explained a general trend, which the clonal plants are able to plastically regulate their biomass allocation, to cope with changing resource availability, at least in stoloniferous and rhizomatous plants.

J	Liu, RR; Li, M; Jia, CX; Wang, BH				Liu, Run-Ran; Li, Ming; Jia, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Bing-Hong			Cascading failures in coupled networks with both inner-dependency and inter-dependency links	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							PERCOLATION	We study the percolation in coupled networks with both inner-dependency and inter-dependency links, where the inner-and inter-dependency links represent the dependencies between nodes in the same or different networks, respectively. We find that when most of dependency links are inner- or inter-ones, the coupled networks system is fragile and makes a discontinuous percolation transition. However, when the numbers of two types of dependency links are close to each other, the system is robust and makes a continuous percolation transition. This indicates that the high density of dependency links could not always lead to a discontinuous percolation transition as the previous studies. More interestingly, although the robustness of the system can be optimized by adjusting the ratio of the two types of dependency links, there exists a critical average degree of the networks for coupled random networks, below which the crossover of the two types of percolation transitions disappears, and the system will always demonstrate a discontinuous percolation transition. We also develop an approach to analyze this model, which is agreement with the simulation results well.

Generally, it is realized by an authenticated key agreement protocol, and many such protocols were proposed in the literature. Recently, Zhang et al. pointed out that Islam et al.'s protocol suffers from the following security weaknesses: (1) Any legal but malicious patient can reveal other user's identity; (2) An attacker can launch off-line password guessing attack and the impersonation attack if the patient's identity is compromised. Zhang et al. also proposed an improved authenticated key agreement scheme with privacy protection for TMIS. However, in this paper, we point out that Zhang et al.'s scheme cannot resist off-line password guessing attack, and it fails to provide the revocation of lost/stolen smartcard. In order to overcome these weaknesses, we propose an improved protocol, the security and authentication of which can be proven using applied pi calculus based formal verification tool ProVerif.

In addition to small bulk Fermi surfaces, the band anticrossing features near the Fermi level can be identified from band structures without spin-orbit coupling, leading to nodal lines in all these compounds. Inclusion of spin-orbit coupling gaps out these nodal lines, leaving only a pair of disentangled electron/hole bands crossing the Fermi level. Therefore, the low-energy physics can be in general captured by the corresponding two-band model with several isolated small Fermi pockets. Detailed analysis of the Fermi surfaces suggests that the arsenides and NbSb2 are nearly compensated semimetals while the phosphorides and TaSb2 are not. Based on the calculated band parities, the electron and hole bands are found to be weakly topological nontrivial, giving rise to surface states. As an example, we presented the surface-direction-dependent band structure of the surfaces states in TaSb2.

This "rest-self" overlap occurs especially in anterior cortical midline structures like the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC). However, the exact neurotemporal and biochemical mechanisms remain to be identified. Therefore, we conducted a combined electroencephalography (EEG)-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) study. EEG focused on pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) power changes to assess the degree to which those changes can predict subjects' perception (and judgment) of subsequent stimuli as high or low self-related. MRS measured resting state concentration of glutamate, focusing on PACC. High pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) alpha power significantly correlated with both perception of stimuli judged to be highly self-related and with resting state glutamate concentrations in the PACC. In sum, our results show (i) pre-stimulus (e.g., prior to stimulus presentation or perception) alpha power and resting state glutamate concentration to mediate rest-self overlap that (ii) dispose or incline subjects to assign high degrees of self-relatedness to perceptual stimuli.

From map-based cloning strategy, a point mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from proline to leucine, was identified in the fourth exon of a glutamyl-tRNA (Gin) amidotransferase B subunit family protein (OsGatB, LOC_Os11g34210). This gene is an ortholog of Arabidopsis GatB and yeast PET112. GatB is a subunit of tRNA-dependent amidotransferase (AdT), an essential enzyme involved in Gln-tRNA(Gln) synthesis in mitochondria. Although previous studies have described that cessation in mitochondrial translation is lethal at very early developmental stages in plants, this point mutation resulted in a non-lethal phenotype of smaller root meristem and shorter root cell length. In the root, OsGatB was predominantly expressed in the root tip and played an important role in cell division and elongation there. OsGatB was localized in the mitochondria, and mitochondrial structure and function were all affected in Osgatb root tip cells.

A three-dimensional finite element model was generated to simulate the experimental setup, which was validated using the experimental data. The fatigue behavior of the bolted joint is influenced by the local stress fields on the faying surface near the holes in single-lap joints. Therefore, with the aim to improve design awareness, the effects of the parameters on the local stress fields were investigated by means of finite element simulation. With an increase in the interference fit size, the occurred position of the maximum stress values on the upper plate faying surface moves away from the hole edge gradually. As the clamping force or friction coefficient increases, the position of larger stress area is changed to the side of bearing load from the transverse direction. The lap geometry of the bolted joint as well as the amplitude of tensile load has apparent impact on the maximum stress value.

This study seeks to bridge the gap by examining how children communicate about their own good deeds, among 7- to 11-year-olds in both China and Canada (total N = 378). Participants cleaned a teacher's messy office in her absence, and their responses were observed when the teacher returned. Only the Chinese children showed an age-related increase in modesty by choosing to falsely deny their own good deeds. This modest behavior was uniquely predicted by Chinese children's evaluations of modesty-related lies. The results suggest that culture-specific socialization processes influence the way children communicate with authority figures about prosocial deeds.

Roots	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article						aluminium; citrate; grain amaranth; oxalate; suppression subtractive hybridization	TOXIC COMPOUND EXTRUSION; OXALATE SECRETION; ACTIVATED CITRATE; RESPONSIVE GENES; ABC TRANSPORTER; OXALIC-ACID; RESISTANCE; TOLERANCE; AL; RICE	Grain amaranth (Amaranthus hypochondriacus L.) is abundant in oxalate and can secrete oxalate under aluminium (Al) stress. However, the features of Al-induced secretion of organic acid anions (OA) and potential genes responsible for OA secretion are poorly understood. Here, Al-induced OA secretion in grain amaranth roots was characterized by ion charomatography and enzymology methods, and suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) together with quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to identify up-regulated genes that are potentially involved in OA secretion. The results showed that grain amaranth roots secrete both oxalate and citrate in response to Al stress. The secretion pattern, however, differs between oxalate and citrate. Neither lanthanum chloride (La) nor cadmium chloride (Cd) induced OA secretion. A total of 84 genes were identified as up-regulated by Al, in which six genes were considered as being potentially involved in OA secretion. The expression pattern of a gene belonging to multidrug and toxic compound extrusion (MATE) family, AhMATE1, was in close agreement with that of citrate secretion. The expression of a gene encoding tonoplast dicarboxylate transporter and four genes encoding ATP-binding cassette transporters was differentially regulated by Al stress, but the expression pattern was not correlated well with that of oxalate secretion. Our results not only reveal the secretion pattern of oxalate and citrate from grain amaranth roots under Al stress, but also provide some genetic information that will be useful for further characterization of genes involved in Al toxicity and tolerance mechanisms.

Included and excluded criteria were formulated. The case group was patients with CAD, and the control group was healthy subjects. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate VDR polymorphisms associations with CAD risk. Heterogeneity was evaluated by Q statistic and I-2 statistic.Seven studies of a total of 2306 CAD patients and 4151 control subjects met the inclusion criteria. The pooled results from Taq1 showed increased risk in allelic model (OR=1.14, 95% CI=1.02-1.28), dominant model (OR=1.21, 95% CI=1.02-1.43), heterozygote model (OR=1.19, 95% CI=1.00-1.1.42), and homozygote model (OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.01-1.61). Besides, Fok1 T>C showed decreased risk in allelic model (OR=0.81, 95% CI=0.65-1.00) and Fok1 A>G also showed decreased risk in allelic model (OR=0.67, 95% CI=0.45-1.00) and recessive model (OR=0.55, 95% CI=0.31-0.97). In Caucasian subgroup, Bsm1showed increased risk in allelic model (OR=1.23, 95% CI=1.02-1.47), heterozygote model (OR=1.20, 95% CI=1.00-1.44), and homozygote model (OR=1.22, 95% CI=1.02-1.45). In CAD patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Apa1showed a decreased risk in heterozygote model (OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.66-0.98); however, increased risk in recessive model (OR=5.00, 95% CI=2.74-9.13) was discovered in CAD patients without T2DM.The Fok1 polymorphism may play a protective role in CAD, and the possible protective role in Apa1 CA genotype in CAD patients with T2DM needs further studies. The Taq1 polymorphism is found to be associated with a significant increase in CAD risk based on our analysis; moreover, increased risk in Apa1 polymorphism in CAD patients without T2DM and Bsm1 polymorphism in Caucasian group is also detected.

Here we investigated the pollination syndrome, pollinator generalization of E. chionantha. Our results showed that the individual flower longevity of E. chionantha was 3-5 days. The flowering phenology of E. chionantha can be divided into five phases. We found significant differences in the pollination efficiency of the different insects visiting E. chionantha with bees and flies being the most efficient pollinators. This, in addition to floral morphology and phenology, suggests that E. chionantha is generalized on bees and flies and possesses an outcrossing, partially self-compatible and pollinator-dependent breeding system.

Here we report a molecule dynamics study on the encapsulation process of different charged CNTs into DNA nanotubes. Our results demonstrated that insertion process of CNTs into DNA nanotubes are charge-tunable. The positive charged CNTs could spontaneously encapsulate and confined in the hollow of DNA nanotubes under the combination of electrostatic and vdW interaction in our ns scale simulation. The conformation of DNA nanotubes is very stable even after the insertion of CNTs. For pristine CNTs, it could not entirely encapsulated by DNA nanotubes in simulation scale in this study. The encapsulation time of pristine CNTs into DNA nanotubes was estimated about 21.9 s based on the potential of mean force along the reaction coordination of encapsulation process of CNTs into DNA nanotubes. In addition, the encapsulation process was also affected by the diameter of CNTs. These findings highlight the charge-tunable self-assembly process of nanomaterials and biomolecules. Our study suggests that the encapsulated CNTs-DNA nanotubes could be used as building blocks for constructing organic-inorganic hybrid materials and has the potential applications in the field of biosensor, drug delivery system and biomaterials etc. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

In all experiments, ICEs were observed when manual localization responses were required to both the cues and targets, but only when the cue-target onset asynchrony (CTOA) was 2,000 ms or longer. In contrast, when saccadic responses were made in response to the cues, ICEs were only observed with CTOAs of 2,000 ms or less-and only when an auditory cue-back signal was used. The present study also showed that the magnitude of ICEs following saccadic responses to arrow cues decreased with time, much like traditional inhibition-of-return effects. The magnitude of ICEs following manual responses to arrow cues, however, appeared later in time and had no sign of decreasing even 3 s after cue onset. These findings suggest that ICEs linked to skeletomotor activation do exist and that the ICEs evoked by oculomotor activation can carry over to the skeletomotor system.

The magnetic structures of Al17Cu2 and Al19Cu clusters are found. Although the high spin ground state of Al12Cu cluster is in accordance with the Hund's rule under spherical Jellium model (SJM), it is difficult to explain why the Al17Cu2 and Al19Cu clusters exhibit larger magnetic moments by the model. A superatom model under equivalent charge distribution is proposed. The magnetic properties of the Cu-doped Al clusters can be explained well by combination of the superatom model with SJM.

However, it remains a huge challenge because of the complex structure and conformation diversity of biomolecules. Herein, a "nanopore-confined recognition" strategy is proposed to manipulate the adsorption of individual valinomycin molecules at room temperature through precise design of functionalized conjugated macrocycle (CPN8) supramolecular nanopores with complementary architectures and binding sites. We revealed that CPN8 prefers to selectively recognizing valinomycin with complementary architecture because of the strong synergistic interactions between the isopropyl groups of valinomycin and the amino groups of CPN8, with valinomycinhighly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) interactions. Our perspectives at the single-molecule level will provide valuable insights to improve the design of supramolecular nanopores for conformation-selective recognition of non-conjugated molecules.

The magnetization measurement reveals a second peak effect and high critical current density J(c) exceeding 2 x 10(6) A cm(-2) at 5 K (self-field). The upper critical field anisotropy was systematically studied by measuring the electrical resistivity under various magnetic fields and angles. The angle-dependent magnetoresistance, by choosing an appropriate anisotropy parameter within the framework of the anisotropic Ginzburg-Landau (AGL) theory, can be scaled onto one single curve. In the normal state, the negative Hall coefficient shows strong but nonmonotonic T-dependence through a minimum at similar to 175 K. Moreover, it is shown that the magnetoresistance apparently violates the semiclassical Kohler's rule below similar to 175 K but can be well scaled by the Hall angle instead. This suggests either a change of carriers with T or exotic anisotropic scattering in the system.

Malware causes lots of harm to users, such as stealing personal information and using too much battery or CPU. Detecting mobile malware is the main task in Android security. In this work, we use a dynamic analysis method to distinguish malware with system call sequences. At first, we track the system calls of applications under different events. Then two different feature models, the frequency vector and the co-occurrence matrix, are employed to extract features from the system call sequence. Finally, we apply Adaptive Regularization Of Weight Vectors and other machine learning algorithms to identify Android malware based on the aforementioned two models, respectively. We evaluate our method with 1189 benign applications and 1227 malicious applications. The experiment results show that the co-occurrence matrix can achieve a much better detection rate than the frequency vector. Our best detection rate is 97.7per cent with false positive rate being 1.34per cent, which is better than those of the existing methods. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In this study, we investigated whether IV pretreatment with emulsified isoflurane (EI) could decrease ischemic brain injury related to the PI3K/Akt pathway. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats received different doses of IV EI (1, 2, 4, or 8 mL/kg/h) or Intralipid r (8 mL/kg/h) for 30 minutes (n = 6-12 per group), followed by middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) for 100 minutes to induce transient focal ischemia. The neurologic score and infarct volume were measured 48 hours after MCAO. Immunostaining, Western blot analysis, and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to assess EI effects on the cell inflammatory response, high-mobility group box-1 release, and phosphorylated Akt (expression. LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, was also infused into the ventricular space before EI to determine the effect of EI. RESULTS: Four milliliters per kilogram per hour of EI reduced the infarct size (21.08 +/- 11.24 vs 37.09 +/- 10.46, P = 0.006), improved neurologic scores after MCAO (1.13 +/- 0.48 vs 1.95 +/- 0.65, P = 0.015), significantly reinforced neuronal survival (982.7 +/- 364.4 vs 439.8 +/- 278.4, P = 0.036), and inhibited CD68+ macrophage/macroglial infiltration in the ischemic core (188.2 +/- 49.1 vs 282 +/- 49.4, P = 0.018) compared with the vehicle group. In the EI pretreatment group, the serum high-mobility group box-1 concentration (3.62 +/- 0.72 vs 5.73 +/- 0.65, P < 0.001) was decreased, and the cerebral phosphorylated Akt level (50.33 +/- 4.73 vs 37.5 +/- 3.11, P = 0.007) was increased at 48 hours, which was inhibited by LY294002 compared with the vehicle group (5.31 +/- 0.72 vs 5.73 +/- 0.65, P = 0.216; 43.00 +/- 4.84 vs 37.5 +/- 3.11, P = 0.091). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that EI pretreatment protects against ischemic brain injury via the inhibition of cerebral inflammation and is associated with the PI3K-Akt pathway in rats with MCAO. This drug may be a novel therapeutic agent for patients after stroke.

This may be related to the different properties of different frequency bands. To investigate the frequency-specific regional homogeneity (ReHo) of spontaneous neural activities in ADHD, the current study used resting-state fMRI to explore the ReHo properties of five frequency bands, slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz), slow-4 (0.027-0.073 Hz), slow-3 (0.073-0.198 Hz), slow-2 (0.198-0.25 Hz) and the extra-low frequency (0-0.01 Hz), in 30 drug-naive boys with ADHD and 30 healthy controls. Compared with controls, the ADHD group showed decreased ReHo in the default mode network (DMN) including the medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus, middle frontal gyrus and angular gyrus. ADHD patients also showed increased ReHo in the posterior cerebellum. Significant interactions between frequency band and group were observed predominantly in the dorsolateral prefrontal and parietal cortices, orbital frontal cortex, supplementary motor area, inferior occipital gyrus, thalamus and anterior cerebellum. In particular, we found that the between-group difference in the extra-low frequency band (0-0.01 Hz) seemed to be greater than that in the other frequency bands for most brain regions. The findings suggest that ADHD children display widespread abnormalities in regional brain activity, particularly in the DMN and attention network, and these abnormalities show frequency specificity.

In this functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study, we examined resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of the insula and its association with Internet gaming characteristics in 74 young adults with Internet gaming disorder (IGD) and 41 age- and gender-matched healthy control subjects (HCs). In comparison with HCs, IGD subjects (IGDs) exhibited enhanced rsFC between the anterior insula and a network of regions including anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), putamen, angular gyrus, and precuneous, which are involved in salience, craving, self-monitoring, and attention. IGDs also demonstrated significantly stronger rsFC between the posterior insula and postcentral gyrus, precentral gyrus, supplemental motor area, and superior temporal gyrus (STG), which are involved in interoception, movement control, and auditory processing. Furthermore, IGD severity was positively associated with connectivity between the anterior insula and angular gyrus, and STG, and with connectivity between the posterior insula and STG. Duration of Internet gaming was positively associated with connectivity between the anterior insula and ACC. These findings highlight a key role of the insula in manifestation of the core symptoms of IGD and the importance to examine functional abnormalities of the anterior and posterior insula separately in IGDs.

Graft spasm remains challenging in coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Calcium antagonists are commonly used in patients with coronary artery disease. This study investigated the inhibitory effect of third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist benidipine on the vasoconstriction induced by various vasoconstrictors in the human internalmammary artery(IMA). Methods. Isolated human IMA rings (N = 65, taken from 37 patients undergoing CABG) were studied in a myograph in 2 ways: the relaxing effect of benidipine on vasoconstrictor-induced precontraction by KCl and U46619 and the depressing effect of benidipine at plasma concentrations on the contraction. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to measure the change of the protein related to the L-type calcium channel. Results. Benidipine caused more relaxation in KCl-contracted (86.7% +/- 3.3%; n = 12) than in U46619-contracted (63.8% +/- 5.3%; n = 8; p < 0.001) IMA rings. Pretreatment of IMA with plasma concentrations of benidipine (-6.92 log M) significantly depressed subsequent contraction by KCl (from 17.3 +/- 2.7 mN to 7.4 +/- 1.2 mN; n = 6; p < 0.05) but did not significantly affect the contraction caused by U46619. Benidipine also caused a decrease of caveolin (CaV) 1.2 protein content (0.55 +/- 0.02 versus 0.63 +/- 0.02 mg/mL; p < 0.05). Conclusions. We conclude that in human IMA, the third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonist benidipine has a potent inhibitory effect on the vasoconstriction mediated by a variety of vasoconstrictors. Use of benidipine in patients undergoing CABG may provide vasorelaxant or antispastic effects in the grafts.

In this study, anammox granules were cultured in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor (R-0), and then the enriched anammox granules were preserved at 35, 20, 4, and -30 A degrees C. The subsequent reactivation characteristics of the granules were evaluated in four UASB reactors (denoted R-1, R-2, R-3, and R-4, respectively) to investigate the effect of preservation temperature on the characteristics of anammox granules and their reactivation performance. The results demonstrated that 4 A degrees C was the optimal preservation temperature for maintaining the biomass, activity, settleability, and integrity of the anammox granules and their cellular structures. During the preservation period, a first-order exponential decay model may be used to simulate the decay of anammox biomass and activity. The protein-to-polysaccharide ratio in the extracellular polymeric substances and the heme c content could not effectively indicate the changes in settleability and activity of the anammox granules, respectively, and a loss of bioactivity was positively associated with the degree of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria cell lysis. After 42 days of storage, the anammox granules preserved at 4 A degrees C (R-3) exhibited a better recovery performance than those preserved at 20 A degrees C (R-2), -30 A degrees C (R-4), and 35 A degrees C (R-1). The comprehensive comparison indicated that 4 A degrees C is the optimal storage temperature for anammox granular sludge because it promotes improved maintenance and recovery performance properties.

Acute exposure to high-level phosphate (>= 50 mM) induced the cytoplasm leakage. During a 195-day continuous-flow operation, the gradually increasing phosphate up to 500 mgPL (1)) slightly affected the specific anammox activity, hardly impacted the heme c content, remarkably decreased the extracellular polymeric substances production and significantly stimulated the dehydrogenase activity of anammox granules. Microbial community analysis showed no shift in the dominant anammox strain and higher population but lower relative abundance of anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria compared to the control granules. Interestingly, novel anammox granules with a hydroxyapatite core were cultivated, which possessed excellent settleability, huge granule diameter and superior mechanical strength. This study supported the application of granule-based anammox process as a pre-processing treatment in phosphate-containing and ammonia-rich wastewaters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The deposition of amyloid beta (A beta) peptide is believed to be the primary cause to neuronal dystrophy and eventually dementia. A beta is the proteolytic product from its precursor amyloid precursor protein (APP) by beta- and gamma- secretase. An optional cleavage by alpha-secretase happens inside the A beta domain. ADAM17 is supposed to be the regulated alpha-secretase of APP. Enhanced activity of ADAM17 leads to the increasing secretion of neuroprotective soluble APP alpha fragment and reduction of A beta generation, which may be benefit to the disease. ADAM17 is then considered the potential therapeutic target for AD. Microglia activation and neuroinflammation is another important event in AD pathogenesis. Interestingly, ADAM17 also participates in the cleavage of many other membrane-bound proteins, especially some inflammatory factors related to microglia activation. The facilitating role of ADAM17 in inflammation and further neuronal damage has also been illustrated. In results, the activation of ADAM17 as the solution to AD may be a tricky task. The comprehensive consideration and evaluation has to be carried out carefully before the final treatment. In the present review, the distinct role of ADAM17 in AD-related APP shedding and neuroinflammatory microglial activation will be carefully discussed.

The Siling reservoir is a major drinking water source for the inhabitants of Yuhang County, Hangzhou City, Zhejiang Province, China. In this study, water quality index (WQI) was verified to calculate scores based on water characteristics data from September 2011 to September 2012. WQI (considering ten parameters) and a minimal water quality index (WQImin) (considering five parameters: dissolved oxygen (DO), electrical conductivity, turbidity, water temperature and pH) were investigated using an online water quality monitoring system. Statistical analysis techniques: correlation analysis and redundancy analysis were employed to analyse the obtained data. The results showed good water quality in the Siling reservoir during autumn and winter. However, a decreased trend in water quality was observed during spring and summer seasons. WQImir, illustrates similar trend to WQI with a better R2 value of 0.99, with a minimum cost and could be useful for the intervallic routine monitoring program. Higher positive correlation between WQI and DO was observed during winter season. Moreover, the results further indicated the risk of algal blooms in the reservoir water; which reflected the effects of climatic condition on reservoir water quality. This study suggested that the resulting WQI provides valuable information on developing, monitoring and understanding surface source water quality for the decision makers and reservoir management.

At 8 T, the magnetoresistance (MR) reached 3.28 x 105% at 2 K, 176% at 300 K. Neither value appeared saturated. We confirmed that TaP is a hole-electron compensated semimetal with a low carrier concentration and high hole mobility of mu h= 3.71 x 105 cm2/ V s, and found that a magnetic-field-induced metal-insulator transition occurs at room temperature. Remarkably, because a magnetic field (H) was applied in parallel to the electric field (E), a negative MR due to a chiral anomaly was observed and reached -3000% at 9 T without any sign of saturation, either, which is in contrast to other Weyl semimetals (WSMs). The analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) oscillations superimposed on the MR revealed that a nontrivial Berry's phase with a strong offset of 0.3958, which is the characteristic feature of charge carriers enclosing a Weyl node. These results indicate that TaP is a promising candidate not only for revealing fundamental physics of the WSM state but also for some novel applications.

Here, the cloning and characterization of one complementary DNA (cDNA) designated as BcHSP70 from young seedlings of Brassica campestris were reported in the present work. Bioinformatic analysis revealed that BcHSP70 belongs to the plant HSP gene family and had the closest relationship with HSP70-4 from Arabidopsis thaliana. Constitutive overexpression of BcHSP70 in tobacco obviously conferred tolerance to heat stress by affecting different plant physiological parameters. In our study, transgenic tobaccos exhibited higher chlorophyll content than wild-type control when exposed to heat stress. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and peroxidase (POD) activities, which were helpful to decrease the damage to the membrane system, were significantly higher in transformants compared to wild-type lines. Meanwhile, lower comparative electrical conductivity and malondialdehyde (MDA) content and higher proline and soluble sugar accumulation were found in transgenic tobaccos than in wild-type lines. All these above results indicated that this isolated BcHSP70 cDNA owned the ability to improve the tolerance to heat stress in transgenic tobacco, which provides helpful information and good basement to culture new robust B. campestris variety resistant to high-temperature stress by molecular breeding in the future.

Such kind of occlusion situation is a challengeable task in multiple vehicles tracking. Various solutions in dealing with the occlusion for vehicles tracking have been proposed in many literatures. However, most of them are specialized on one tracking method and cannot flexibly adapt to the others. In this paper, we propose an adaptive partial occlusion segmentation method (APPOS) for multiple vehicles tracking. In this method, the occlusion detection process is firstly conducted to discover the occlusion. After that, the candidate regions of the respective occluded vehicles are roughly evaluated by the contour's optical flow. Finally, the line scanning which uses color contrast among regions is adopted to accurately locate the vehicles. We evaluate the effectiveness and accuracy of APPOS by the experiments on practical and simulating videos. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The excess molar volume, partial excess volume at infinite dilution, isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion, excess refraction indices, Lorentz-Lorenz molar refraction and the deviation in molar refraction have been calculated using these data. The results have been incorporated into the Redlich-Kister equation and used to estimate the binary interaction parameters and standard deviations. The values of partial excess volume at infinite dilution and excess refraction indices for the four binary systems at different temperatures were calculated using the adjustable parameters of the Redlich-Kister smoothing equation. The factors that affect these excess quantities have been discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

As the amount of social data increases in a great deal and cloud computing techniques become developed, the architecture of mobile social network is evolved into cloud-based that mobile clients send data to the cloud and make data accessible from clients. The data in the cloud should be stored in a secure fashion to protect user privacy and restrict data sharing defined by users. Ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) is currently considered to be a promising security solution for cloud-based mobile social network to encrypt the sensitive data. However, its ciphertext size and decryption time grow linearly with the attribute numbers in the access structure. In order to reduce the computing overhead held by the mobile devices, in this paper we propose a new Outsourcing decryption and Match-then-decrypt CP-ABE algorithm (OM-CP-ABE) which firstly outsources the computation-intensive bilinear pairing operations to a proxy, and secondly performs the decryption test on the attributes set matching access policy in ciphertexts. The experimental performance assessments show the security strength and efficiency of the proposed solution in terms of computation, communication, and storage. Also, our construction is proven to be replayable choosen-ciphertext attacks (RCCA) secure based on the decisional bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption in the standard model.

Interestingly, functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) has emerged as a highly promising neuroimaging technique that enables continuous and noninvasive monitoring of changes in blood oxygenation and blood volume in the human brain. In this study, fNIRS was used in combination with complex network theory to extract the attribute features of the functional brain networks underling deception in subjects exhibiting spontaneous or controlled behaviors. Our findings revealed that the small-world networks of the subjects engaged in spontaneous behaviors exhibited greater clustering coefficients, shorter average path lengths, greater average node degrees, and stronger randomness compared with those of subjects engaged in control behaviors. Consequently, we suggest that small-world network topology is capable of distinguishing well between spontaneous and controlled deceptions.

J	Northoff, G; Stanghellini, G				Northoff, Georg; Stanghellini, Giovanni			How to Link Brain and Experience? Spatiotemporal Psychopathology of the Lived Body	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						abnormal bodily phenomena; brain resting state; phenomenology; schizophrenia; spatio-temporal; psychopathology	ABNORMAL BODILY PHENOMENA; STATE EEG POWER; NEURONAL DYNAMICS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; OSCILLATIONS; NETWORK; CONSCIOUSNESS; COORDINATION; PSYCHOSIS; INSIGHTS	The focus of the present article is on sketching a psychopathology of the body in schizophrenia and linking it to brain activity. This is done providing converging data from psychopathological evidence (phenomenal), phenomenological contructs (transphenomenal) and neuroscientific measures (pre-phenomenal). The phenomenal level is the detailed documentation of the patients' subjective anomalous experiences. These phenomena are explicit contents in the patients' field of consciousness. The trans-phenomenal level targets the implicit yet operative matrix that underlies these anomalous subjective experiences. Abnormal phenomena are viewed as expressions of amodification of trans-phenomenal matrix, that is, interms of an abnormal synthesis or integration through time of intero-, proprio- and extero-ceptive stimuli. Finally, we link the abnormalities of the trans-phenomenal matrix to pre- phenomenal alterations of the brain resting state and of its spatio-temporal organization, as documented by neurobiological methods providing spatial and temporal resolution of intrinsic brain activity (with many features of the resting state remaining yet unclear though). Based on phenomenological research, the body in schizophrenia is typically experienced in an itemized way as an object external to one's self and unrelated to events in the external world. Based on neurobiological data, we tentatively hypothesize that such anomalies of the lived body are related to decreased integration between intero-, extero- and proprioceptive experiences by the brain's spontaneous activity and its temporal structure. Taken all together, this suggests that we view abnormalities of bodilyexperience interms of their underlying abnormal spatiotemporal features which, as we suppose, can be traced back to the spatiotemporal features of the brains spantaneous activity.

In this probe, two picolinamide units complex with one Cu2+ ion and two nitrogen atoms in each picolinamide unit coordinate with Cu2+, which is verified by DFT calculation. Its fluorescence quantum yield is 0.43 and the detection limit is as low as 2.4 x 10(-8) mol/L. The results show that the probe displays good selectivity for Cu2+ over other ions (Mn2+, Pb2+, Cr3+, Zn2+, Ni2+, K+, Ca2+, Ag+, Mg2+, Fe3+, Fe2+, Hg2+, Ap(+), Cd2+, Pd2+, Co2+). Furthermore, the probe induced by Cu2+ and the pi-pi interaction of the aromatic unit can also form rod structure assembly, which can be observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).

Here we show how these two tasks could differentially engage subsequent recollection-based associative recognition and consequently lead to the turn-on or turn-off of the unitised familiarity effect. In the compound task, participants studied unrelated word pairs as newly learned compounds. In the interactive imagery task, participants studied the same word pairs as interactive images. An associative recognition task was used in combination with the Remember/Know procedure to measure recollection-based and familiarity-based associative recognition. The results showed that the unitised familiarity effect was present in the compound task but was absent in the interactive imagery task. A comparison of the compound and the interactive imagery task revealed a dramatic increase in recollection-based associative recognition for the interactive imagery task. These results suggest that unitisation could benefit familiarity-based associative recognition; however, this effect will be eliminated when the memory trace formed is easily accessed by strong recollection without the need for a familiarity assessment.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for the weak decay eta ' -> K-+/-pi(-/+) and precise measurement of the branching fraction B(J/psi -> phi eta ')	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							J/PSI	We present the first search for the rare decay of eta' into K-+/- pi(-/+) in J/psi -> phi eta', using a sample of 1.3 x 10(9) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector. No significant signal is observed, and the upper limit at the 90% confidence level for the ratio B(eta' -> K-+/- pi(-/+))/B(eta' -> gamma pi(+/-) pi(-/+)) is determined to be 1.3 x 10(-4). In addition, we report the measurement of the branching fraction of J/psi -> phi eta' to be [5.10 +/- 0.03(stat) +/- 0.32(syst)] x 10(-4), which agrees with previous results from BESII.

Here, we fractionated crude venoms and analyzed them using a combination of proteomic techniques. Three finger toxins (3-FTx) and phospholipase A(2) (PLA(2)) were most abundant in both species, respectively accounting for 32.6% and 66.4% of total B. multicinctus venom, and 84.3% and 122% of total N. atra venom. Venoms from these two species contained one common protein family and six less abundant species-specific protein families. The proteomic profiles of B. multicinctus and N. atra venoms and analysis of toxicological activity in mice suggested that 3-FTx and PLA2 are the major contributors to clinical symptoms caused by envenomation. The venoms differed in enzymatic activity, likely the result of inter-specific variation in the amount of related venom components. Antivenomics assessment revealed that a small number of venom components (3-FTxs and PLA(2)s in B. multicinctus, and 3-Ffxs in N. atra) could not be immunocaptured completely, suggesting that we should pay attention to enhancing the immune response of these components in designing commercial antivenoms for B. multicinctus and N. atra. Biological significance: The proteomic profiles of venoms from two medically important snake species B. multicinctus and N. atra - have been explored. Quantitative and qualitative differences are evident in both venoms when proteomic profiles and transcriptomic results are compared; this is a reminder that combined approaches are needed to explore the precise composition of snake venom. Two protein families (3-FTx and PLA2) of high abundance in these snake venoms are major players in the biochemical and pharmacological effects of envenomation. Elucidation of the proteomic profiles of these snake venoms is helpful in understanding composition-function relationships and will facilitate the clinical application of antivenoms.

PAK5-mediated E47 phosphorylation promotes epithelial-mesenchymal transition and metastasis of colon cancer	ONCOGENE			English	Article							COLORECTAL-CANCER; E-CADHERIN; TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS; GASTRIC-CANCER; DOWN-REGULATION; CELL-ADHESION; E2A PROTEINS; KINASE; MIGRATION; INVASION	The p21-activated kinase 5 (PAK5) is overexpressed in advanced cancer and the transcription factor E47 is a direct repressor of E-cadherin and inducer of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the relationship between PAK5 and E47 has not been explored. In this study, we found that PAK5-mediated E47 phosphorylation promoted EMT in advanced colon cancer. PAK5 interacted with E47 and phosphorylated E47 on Ser39 under hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) stimulation, which decreased cell-cell cohesion, increased cell migration and invasion in vitro and promoted metastasis in a xenograft model. Furthermore, phosphorylation of E47 facilitated its accumulating in nucleus in an importin a-dependent manner, and enhanced E47 binding to E-cadherin promoter directly, leading to inhibition of E-cadherin transcription. In contrast, PAK5-knockdown resulted in blockage of HGF-induced E47 phosphorylation, attenuated association of E47 with importin a and decreased E47 binding to E-cadherin promoter. In addition, we demonstrated a close correlation between PAK5 and phospho-Ser39 E47 expression in colon cancer specimens. More importantly, high expression of phospho-E47 was associated with an aggressive phenotype of colon cancer and nuclear phospho-E47 staining was found in certain cases of colon cancer with metastasis. Collectively, E47 is a novel substrate of PAK5, and PAK5-mediated phosphorylation of E47 promotes EMT and metastasis of colon cancer, suggesting that phosphorylated E47 on Ser39 may be a potential therapeutic target in progressive colon cancer.

While many inhibitors targeting these pathways have been developed, the anti-leukemic effect was not as robust as expected. As part of the molecular link between PI3K/Akt and mTOR kinase, the role of Rheb1 in AML remains unexplored. Our study aims to explore the role of Rheb1 in AML and estimate whether Rheb1 could be a potential target of AML treatment. Methods: The expressions of Rheb1 and other indicated genes were analyzed using real-time PCR. AML mouse model was established by retrovirus transduction. Leukemia cell properties and related signaling pathways were dissected by in vitro and in vivo studies. The transcriptional changes were analyzed via gene chip analysis. Molecular reagents including mTOR inhibitor and mTOR activator were used to evaluate the function of related signaling pathway in the mouse model. Results: We observed that Rheb1 is overexpressed in AML patients and the change of Rheb1 level in AML patients is associated with their median survival. Using a Rheb1-deficient MLL-AF9 murine AML model, we revealed that Rheb1 deletion prolonged the survival of AML mice by weakening LSC function. In addition, Rheb1 deletion arrested cell cycle progression and enhanced apoptosis of AML cells. Furthermore, while Rheb1 deletion reduced mTORC1 activity in AML cells, additional rapamycin treatment further decreased mTORC1 activity and increased the apoptosis of Rheb1(Delta/Delta) AML cells. The mTOR activator 3BDO partially rescued mTORC1 signaling and inhibited apoptosis in Rheb1(Delta/Delta) AML cells. Conclusions: Our data suggest that Rheb1 promotes AML progression through mTORC1 signaling pathway and combinational drug treatments targeting Rheb1 and mTOR might have a better therapeutic effect on leukemia.

PVDF-g-[ VBIM] [ Cl]) nanodomains on the crystallization behavior in nanostructured PVDF/ [ VBIM][ Cl] composite was investigated by means of differential scanning calorimeter ( DSC), polarized optical microscope( POM) and wide. angle X-ray diffractometer( WAXD) measurements. H-1 nuclear magnetic resonance ( H-1 NMR) results confirm the successful grafting of [ VBIM] [ Cl] onto the PVDF chains. Transmission electron microscopy( TEM) images show PVDF-g-[ VBIM][ Cl] nanodomains in the nanostruc. tured PVDF/ [ VBIM] [ Cl] ( 100/ 8, mass ratio) composite, which is distinct from the miscible PVDF/ [ VBIM][ Cl] blend prepared by physically blending. The DSC results show higher crystallization temperature ( T-c) and shorter crystallization time in the nanostructured PVDF/ [ VBIM][ Cl] composite, compared with those of neat PVDF and PVDF/ [ VBIM] [ Cl] blend( 100/ 8), respectively, indicating that nanodomains enhanced the crystallization rate of the PVDF crystals. Moreover, a larger nucleation density accompanied with smaller spherulites was observed in the nanostructured sample by POM photos. It is considered that strong thermodynamic incompatibility of nanodomains with PVDF matrix caused a large amount of partially ordered molecular chains at their interface, which favorites the nucleus formation and thus improves the entire crystallization rate of the PVDF crystals. Because of the confinement of [ VBIM][ Cl] within nanodomains, dominant non. polar. crystals were found in the nanostructured sample, which was the same with that of neat PVDF.

The epigenetic regulation of Wnt signaling in HSCs remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the histone deacetylase SIRT6 regulates HSC homeostasis through the transcriptional repression of Wnt target genes. Sirt6 deletion promoted HSC proliferation through aberrant activation of Wnt signaling. SIRT6-deficient HSCs exhibited impaired self-renewal ability in serial competitive transplantation assay. Mechanistically, SIRT6 inhibits the transcription of Wnt target genes by interacting with transcription factor LEF1 and deacetylating histone 3 at lysine 56. Pharmacological inhibition of the Wnt pathway rescued the aberrant proliferation and functional defect in SIRT6-deficient HSCs. Taken together, these findings disclose a new link between SIRT6 and Wnt signaling in the regulation of adult stem cell homeostasis and self-renewal capacity.

The focus of this work is to propose a crosstalk-insensitive method for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators, which is important in large-scale quantum information processing and communication in a network consisting of resonators or cavities. In this work, we consider 2N resonators of different frequencies, which are coupled to a three-level quantum system (qutrit). By applying a strong pulse to the coupler qutrit, we show that an effective Hamiltonian can be constructed for simultaneously coupling multiple pairs of resonators. The main advantage of this proposal is that the effect of inter-resonator crosstalks is greatly suppressed by using resonators of different frequencies. In addition, by employing the qutrit-resonator dispersive interaction, the intermediate higher-energy level of the qutrit is virtually excited and thus decoherence from this level is suppressed. This effective Hamiltonian can be applied to implement quantum operations with photonic qubits distributed in different resonators. As one application of this Hamiltonian, we show how to simultaneously generate multiple Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs of photonic qubits distributed in 2N resonators. Numerical simulations show that it is feasible to prepare two high-fidelity EPR photonic pairs using a setup of four one-dimensional transmission line resonators coupled to a superconducting flux qutrit with current circuit QED technology.

Perturbations in autophagy are found in gastric cancer. In host gastric cells, autophagy can be induced by Helicobacter pylori (or H. pylori) infection, which is associated with the oncogenesis of gastric cancer. In gastric cancer cells, autophagy has both pro-survival and pro-death functions in determining cell fate. Besides, autophagy modulates gastric cancer metastasis by affecting a wide range of pathological events, including extracellular matrix (ECM) degradation, epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), tumor angiogenesis, and tumor microenvironment. In addition, some of the autophagy-related proteins, such as Beclin 1, microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (MAP1-LC3), and p62/sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1) have certain prognostic values for gastric cancer. In this article, we review the recent studies regarding the functional role of autophagy in gastric cancer.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of psi decays to the Xi(-)(Xi)over-bar(+) and Sigma(1385)(-/+)(Sigma)over-bar(1385)(+/-) final states	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							J/PSI	We study the decays of the charmonium resonances J/psi and psi(3686) to the final states Xi(-)(Xi) over bar (+), S(1385)(-/+)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(+/-) based on a single baryon tag method using data samples of (223.7 +/- 1.4) x 10(6) J/psi and (106.4 +/- 0.9) x 10(6) psi(3686) events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. The decay psi(3686) -> Sigma(1385)(-/+)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(+/-) is observed for the first time, and the measurements of the other processes, including the branching fractions and angular distributions, are in good agreement with, and much more precise than, the previously published results. Additionally, the ratios B(psi(3686)->Xi(-)(Xi) over bar (+))/B(J/psi ->Xi(-)(Xi) over bar (+)), B(psi(3686)->Sigma(1385)(-)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(+))/B(J/psi ->Sigma(1385)(-)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(+)) and B(psi(3686)->Sigma(1385)(+)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(-))/B(J/psi ->Sigma(1385)(+)(Sigma) over bar (1385)(-)) are detetmind	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X.

MethodsIn the present study, a FLAG tagged Anguilla japonica lectin 1 (AJL1) expression cassette was genetically harbored in a replication-defective adenovirus genome, forming Ad.FLAG-AJL1. The exogenous AJL1-induced cytotoxicity and the underlying mechanisms were analyzed. ResultsThe exogenous AJL1 suppressed the proliferation of a variety of human cancer cells by inducing apoptosis. Caspase 9, Bcl-2, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1/2-extracellular signal-regulated kinase and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase were found to be responsible for the exogenous AJL1-induced cytotoxicity. AJL1 was further suggested to regulate PRMT5-E2F-1 pathway, a pathway shared by previously reported marine lectins Dicentrarchus labrax fucose binding lectin and Strongylocentrotus purpuratus rhamnose binding lectin. A localization study revealed that exogenous AJL1 widely distributed in the cell membrane and cytoplasm. ConclusionsThe results of the present study suggest that the PRMT5-E2F-1 pathway may act as a common target for exogenous lectins including AJL1, and the cellular response to exogenous AJL1 may suggest a novel agent for cancer gene therapy.

Hsa-miRNA-31 regulates epithelial cell barrier function by inhibiting TNFSF15 expression	CELLULAR AND MOLECULAR BIOLOGY			English	Article						TNFSF15; miRNA-31; epithelial proliferation; barrier function	INFLAMMATORY-BOWEL-DISEASE; MICRORNA EXPRESSION; CROHNS-DISEASE; KAPPA-B; PROLIFERATION; DIFFERENTIATION; APOPTOSIS; CYTOKINE; COLON; SUSCEPTIBILITY	Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by epithelial barrier disruption and alterations in immune regulation but with the etiology unknown. MicroRNA-31 is the most consistent differentially expressed miRNA in ulcerative colitis tissue. The aim of this project is to study the important roles of miRNA-31 in regulation of intestinal epithelial barrier function. We found that expression of miRNA-31 is proportional to the proliferation of Caco2-BBE cells and overexpression of miRNA-31 can increase its trans-epithelial resistance (TER) by decreasing the transepithelial permeability. miRNA-31 can directly bind to the 3-UTR of TNFSF15, thereafter negatively regulating its expression in Caco2-BBE cells. BrdU and TUNEL analysis demonstrated that transfection of miRNA-31 stimulates proliferation or apoptosis-resistance. Taken together, these results revealed a novel mecha-nism underlying the regulation of epithelial barrier function by miRNA-31 during its regulation on proliferation of epithelial cells.

Coordination patterns of the local morphological features among regions, however, are not well understood. Here, we constructed individual-level morphological brain networks and systematically examined their topological organization and long-term test-retest reliability under different analytical schemes of spatial smoothing, brain parcellation, and network type. MethodsThis study included 57 healthy participants and all participants completed two MRI scan sessions. Individual morphological brain networks were constructed by estimating interregional similarity in the distribution of regional gray matter volume in terms of the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. Graph-based global and nodal network measures were then calculated, followed by the statistical comparison and intra-class correlation analysis. ResultsThe morphological brain networks were highly reproducible between sessions with significantly larger similarities for interhemispheric connections linking bilaterally homotopic regions. Further graph-based analyses revealed that the morphological brain networks exhibited nonrandom topological organization of small-worldness, high parallel efficiency and modular architecture regardless of the analytical choices of spatial smoothing, brain parcellation and network type. Moreover, several paralimbic and association regions were consistently revealed to be potential hubs. Nonetheless, the three studied factors particularly spatial smoothing significantly affected quantitative characterization of morphological brain networks. Further examination of long-term reliability revealed that all the examined network topological properties showed fair to excellent reliability irrespective of the analytical strategies, but performing spatial smoothing significantly improved reliability. Interestingly, nodal centralities were positively correlated with their reliabilities, and nodal degree and efficiency outperformed nodal betweenness with respect to reliability. ConclusionsOur findings support single-subject morphological network analysis as a meaningful and reliable method to characterize structural organization of the human brain; this method thus opens a new avenue toward understanding the substrate of intersubject variability in behavior and function and establishing morphological network biomarkers in brain disorders.

In this study, the full-length cDNA of Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) BAFF (tBAFF) was amplified from the spleen by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). The open reading frame of this cDNA encodes a protein of 261 amino acids containing a predicted transmembrane domain and a furin protease cleavage site, similar to mammalian, avian, and reptile BAFF. Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that tBAFF is present in various tissues and is predominantly expressed in the spleen. The predicted three-dimensional (3D) structure of the Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) soluble BAFF (tsBAFF) monomer was determined by (3D) structure modeling monomeranalyzed by (3D) structure mouse counterpart. Both tsBAFF and EGFP/tsBAFF were efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. After purification, the EGFP/tsBAFF fusion protein showed a fluorescence spectrum similar to that of EGFP. Laser scanning confocal microscopy showed that EGFP/tsBAFF bound to its receptor. In vitro, tsBAFF promoted the proliferation of Nile tilapia and mouse splenic B cells together with/without a priming agent (Staphylococcus aureus Cowan 1, SAC) or anti-mouse 1gM. Furthermore, tsBAFF showed a similar proliferation-stimulating effect on mouse B cells compared to msBAFF. These findings indicate that tsBAFF plays an important role in the proliferation of Nile tilapia B cells and has functional cross reactivity among Nile tilapia and mammals. Therefore, BAFF may represent a useful factor for enhancing immunological efficacy in animals. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this study, a geometry-related profile of SysML is first proposed to specify the geometric information of mechanical structure to support the generation of initial CAD models from SysML models. Second, a model comparison-based method is introduced to obtain the model changes to facilitate the incremental update between distributed heterogeneous models. Third, a multidisciplinary design optimization based method is introduced to deal with the design conflicts that hinder model integration during multidisciplinary design. Finally, a five-bar robot is used as a case study to demonstrate the whole proposed method. Note to Practitioners-Online collaborative design between multidomain designers is a complex task. Traditionally, the collaborative design introduces various documents to transfer the design information between various domains. However, active associations between multidomain models should be established for online collaborative design to obtain high design efficiency. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE), relating the system design models to the detailed design models, are also necessary. Currently, the CAD models are usually generated manually from the SysML models due to the lack of geometric information modeling method for mechanical structure using SysML. In the present work, a geometry-related modeling method is provided to automate the generation of CAD models. SysML is introduced for system modeling, because it is the standard language of system engineering. Moreover, finding out the model changes is also critical to implement the incremental model update to propagate the model changes (or design changes) to the relevant models of other domains. A general method for finding out model change is proposed. Since design conflicts are inevitable in collaborative multidisciplinary design, an optimization-based method is introduced to evaluate the effects of design changes that may cause design conflicts. If design conflicts arise, the method will determine the optimal alternatives for mitigating such conflicts.

The excess molar volume, partial excess volume at infinite dilution, isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion, excess refraction indices, Lorentz-Lorenz molar refraction, and the deviation in molar refraction have been calculated using these data. The results have been incorporated into the Redlich-Kister equation and used to estimate the binary interaction parameters and standard deviation. The values of partial excess volume at infinite dilution and excess refraction indices for the four binary systems at different temperatures were calculated using the adjustable parameters of the Redlich-Kister smoothing equation. The factors that affect these excess quantities have been discussed.

J	Liu, DL; Zhong, SM				Liu, Dilin; Zhong, Shouman			L2 vs. L1 Use of Synonymy: An Empirical Study of Synonym Use/Acquisition	APPLIED LINGUISTICS			English	Article							BEHAVIORAL PROFILE	Synonymy is important but difficult for language learners to grasp. Using a forced-choice question instrument, along with corpus data as reference, this study examines the use of four sets of synonyms by intermediate/advanced Chinese EFL/ESL learners and native English speakers. The data analyses reveal several key findings, including a general synonym acquisition trajectory. First, synonyms are often differentiated by their typical collocates; hence, the acquisition of synonyms is largely the learning of their salient collocates. Secondly, construal of the communicative purpose/context at hand also plays an important role in synonym selection. Thirdly, EFL/ESL learners begin to show some grasp of the salient usages/meanings of synonyms, and their grasp of synonyms advances significantly as their English proficiency increases to advanced level, but advanced learners still exhibit difficulties in synonym use, including an inadequate ability in forming context-called-for unique construals. Fourthly, frequency plays a crucial role in synonym acquisition, as low-frequency synonyms and salient synonym collocation usages with a low raw frequency are especially difficult for L2 learners. Implications for pedagogy and future research are also discussed.

However, its association with other cellular events, and in particular, cell death, remain unknown. To examine the function of such fusion genes, an expression plasmid containing the TMPRSS2: ERG (T1/E5) sequence (Delta ERG) from a patient sample was constructed and transiently transfected into DU145 cells, which do not express the fusion gene. It was found that the overexpression of Delta ERG significantly inhibited the ability of cisplatin to induce apoptosis in DU145 cells. By contrast, VCaP cells, which do contain TMPRSS2: ERG, were sensitized to cisplatin-induced apoptosis through siRNA inhibition of the fusion gene. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, a stable cell line expressing the Delta ERG gene was constructed. Expression of Delta ERG did not affect cell migration, but did protect cells from DNA damage and apoptosis induced by cisplatin. Furthermore, knockdown of Delta ERG by short interfering RNA resulted in cells regaining their sensitivity to cisplatin. Finally, the gene coding for activating transcription factor 5, which is important for cell survival, may be upregulated by Delta ERG. Taken together, these data point to a new function of the TMPRSS2: ERG fusion gene in regulating the apoptotic pathway.

J	Yang, JF; Huang, RH; Kinshuk				Yang, Junfeng; Huang, Ronghuai; Kinshuk			The Learning Preferences of Digital Learners in K-12 Schools in China	EURASIA JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION			English	Article						digital native; digital immigrants; K-12 class; digital learner; learning preference	NATIVES DEBATE; NET GENERATION; INTERNET USE; TECHNOLOGY	Students grown up with digital technology and Internet are called digital natives or net generation. All others, who grew up without so much immersion with digital technologies are called digital immigrants. Researchers held different ideas on whether a new generation of learners existed. One of the foci of the debate is on the appropriateness of using age as the criteria to divide "digital native" and "digital immigrants". In order to reconcile the debate, the term "digital learner" was used in this paper, with the hypothesis that the time length for using technology could be used as the criteria for dividing digital learners. It is also noticed that there were few studies focused on the learning preferences of today's learners in Chinese context. In order to understand learners' learning preference and test our hypothesis, a large-scale survey with 44470 participants and 7 focus group interviews were conducted with 28 participants. Results showed NetizenYears that indicated the number of years passed since he/she first time got online could be used as the criteria of digital learners. Digital learners could be labeled as 1-NetizenYear digital learners, 2-NetzizenYears digital learners, and so on, and non-digital learners are those with 0 NetizenYear. Results revealed that non-digital learners and digital learners had significantly different Internet use patterns. More positive attitudes to Internet, more active participation online and more tendency to Internet addiction were found for digital learners with increasing NetizenYears. The gap between digital learner's preferred learning approach and teaching methods in classroom was discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion on using the time length of using technology as the criteria for digital learners.

Dscam1 encodes 38,016 distinct isoforms via mutually exclusive splicing in D. melanogaster, while the vertebrate clustered Pcdhs utilize alternative promoters to generate isoform diversity. Here we reveal a shortened Dscam gene family with tandemly arrayed 50 cassettes in Chelicerata. These cassette repeats generally comprise two or four exons, corresponding to variable Immunoglobulin 7 (Ig7) or Ig7-8 domains of Drosophila Dscam1. Furthermore, extraordinary isoform diversity has been generated through a combination of alternating promoter and alternative splicing. These sDscams have a high sequence similarity with Drosophila Dscam1, and share striking organizational resemblance to the 50 variable regions of vertebrate clustered Pcdhs. Hence, our findings have important implications for understanding the functional similarities between Drosophila Dscam1 and vertebrate Pcdhs, and may provide further mechanistic insights into the regulation of isoform diversity.

The best way to investigate these problems is to begin from the initiation of corresponding signaling cascades activated by IL-24 with screening and identifying those proteins that interacted with IL-24. With the aim of identifying these initial interactions, a yeast two-hybrid screening was performed by transforming AH109 cells containing PGBKT7-IL-24 with a liver cDNA plasmid library. These cells were then plated on synthetic nutrient medium (SD/-Trp/-Leu/-His) for the first screening and on quadruple dropout medium containing X-alpha-gal for the second screening. Positive colonies were further verified by repeating the MATE experiments, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) analysis, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assays in vitro. Following the yeast two-hybrid screening, 15 genes were selected for sequencing, with two genes, HLA-C and NDUFA13, further verified using Co-IP assays and FRET assays. Both HLA-C and NDUFA13 were found to interact with IL-24. We found that HLA-C and NDUFA13 could interact with IL-24 and it may be involved in the signal induced by IL-24. Overall, this study contributes further insight into the cancer-specific apoptosis-inducing abilities of IL-24 to potentially enhance its therapeutic potential, and it also provides outlets for other biological functions of IL-24.

In this paper, a practical method is proposed for on-orbit estimation of polarization response. First, the linear polarization components of the Stokes vector entering the sensor are estimated by a vector radiative transfer model of the coupled ocean-atmosphere system. Second, the real radiance entering the sensor is estimated by another high-accuracy ocean color sensor using the cross-calibration method. Finally, based on the estimated linear polarization components and real radiance, the polarization response coefficients are derived by the least squares method. The proposed method is tested by applying it to the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectro-radiometer on board the Aqua satellite, and the derived polarization factors are consistent with the prelaunch values, indicating the reliability of the proposed method. In addition, our results reveal that the contribution of aerosol scattering should be included in the estimation of the linear polarization components of the Stokes vector at the top of atmosphere, particularly for long wavelengths.

In spite of the advancement and progress in medical research and technology, the underlying causative factors and mechanisms of CHD still remain unclear. Bone morphogenetic protein receptor IA (ALK3) mediates the development of ventricular septal defect (VSD). We have recently found that paired box gene 8 (Pax8) may be the downstream molecule of ALK3. Paired box gene 8 plays an essential role in VSD, and apoptosis and proliferation imbalance leads to septal dysplasia. Recent studies have also disclosed that cellular senescence also participates in embryonic development. Whether programmed senescence exists in cardiac organogenesis has not ever been reported. We hypothesized that together with various biological processes, such as apoptosis, enhanced cellular senescence may occur actively in the development of Pax8 null mice murine hearts. In H9C2 myogenic cells, Pax8 overexpression can rescue caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by ALK3 silencing. Senescent cells and senescence-associated mediators in Pax8 knockout hearts increased compared with the wild-type ones in an age-dependent manner. These results suggest that Pax8 maybe the downstream molecule of ALK3, it mediates the murine heart development perhaps via cellular senescence, which may serve as a mechanism that compensates for the cell loss via apoptosis in heart development.

This study is to determine the association of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in dopa decarboxylase (DDC) and dopamine receptor-1 (DRD1) genes with childhood autism, in a Chinese Han population. A total of 211 autistic children and 250 age- and gender-matched healthy controls were recruited. The severity of disease was determined by Children Autism Rating Scale scores. TaqMan Probe by real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to determine genotypes and allele frequencies of single-nucleotide polymorphism rs6592961 in DDC and rs251937 in DRD1. Case-control and case-only studies were respectively performed, to determine the contribution of both single-nucleotide polymorphisms to the predisposition of disease and its severity. Our results showed that there was no significant association of the genotypes and allele frequencies of both single-nucleotide polymorphisms concerning childhood autism and its severity.

The BCR-ABL protein is an important client protein of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). BIIB021, an orally available Hsp90 inhibitor, has activity against various cancer cells. However, little is known about the inhibitory effect of BIIB021 on CML cells. We evaluated the inhibitory effects of BIIB021 on K562, K562/G (an imatinib-resistant cell lines), as well as 32D mouse leukemic cells expressing wild-type BCR-ABL (b3a2, 32Dp210) and T315I mutant BCR-ABL (32Dp210-T315I) cells. Our data showed that BIIB021 induced significant growth inhibition and apoptosis that was predominantly mediated by the mitochondrial pathway. BIIB021 also resulted in proteasomal degradation of BCR-ABL proteins. In addition to induction of apoptosis, we report for the first time that BIIB021 induced autophagic response as evidenced by the formation of autophagosome, increased conversion of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3)-I to LC3-II, decreased p62 (SQSTM1) protein levels. Further study suggested that Akt-mTOR-Ulk1 signaling pathway was involved in BIIB021-triggered autophagy. Moreover, blocking autophagy using pharmacological inhibitor 3-methyladenine and bafilomycin A1 significantly enhanced cell death and apoptosis induced by BIIB021, indicating the cytoprotective role of autophagy in BIIB021-treated CML cells. Collectively, these data provide possible molecular mechanisms for the antileukemic effect of BIIB021 on imatinib-sensitive and -resistant CML cells and provide new insights into the future application of BIIB021 in the clinical treatment of CML.

We found that the stoichiometric CsNi2Se2 compound undergoes a superconducting transition at T-c = 2.7 K. A large Sommerfeld coefficient gamma(n) (similar to 77.90 mJ/mol K-2) was obtained from the normal state electronic specific heat. However, the Kadowaki-Woods ratio of CsNi2Se2 was estimated to be about 0.041. x. 10(-5) mu Omega cm(mol K-2/mJ)(2), indicating the absence of strong electron-electron correlations. In the superconducting state, we found that the zero-field electronic specific heat data, C-es(T) (0.5 K <= T < 2.7 K), can be fitted well with a two-gap BCS model, indicating the multi-gap feature of CsNi2Se2. The comparison with the density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggested that the large gamma(n) in these nickel selenide superconductors may be related to the large density of states (DOS) at the Fermi surface.

A strong diamagnetic signal below Tc in susceptibility chi(T) is observed indicating the bulk nature of superconductivity. Different to most BiS2-based compounds where superconductivity develops from a semiconducting-like normal state, the present compound exhibits a metallic behavior down to Tc. Under weak magnetic field or pressure, however, a remarkable crossover from metallic to insulating behaviors takes place around T-min where the resistivity picks up a local minimum. With increasing pressure, T-c. decreases monotonously and T-min shifts to high temperatures, while the absolute value of the normal state resistivity at low temperatures first decreases and then increases with pressure up to 2.5 GPa. These results imply that the electronic structure of Sr0.5La0.5FBiSe2 may be different to those in the other BiS2-based systems.

Molybdenum disulfide/polyaniline (MoS2/PANI) is prepared by in situ polymerization. Graphene oxide is well-dispersed by loading MoS2/PANI nanoparticles (50-80 nm in size) and reduced using urea via a hydrothermal treatment, achieving the ternary nanocomposite. As for the composites prepared at different mass ratios of MoS2/PANI to rGO, the ternary MoS2/PANI/rGO with a mass ratio of 1:1 has a high specific capacitance of 618 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) and 476 F g(-1) at 20 A g(-1) with a retainment of 96% in a three-electrode system, in comparison to the specific capacitance of 418 F g(-1) at 1.0 A g(-1) and 78% retained capacitance after 2000 cycles of MoS2/PANI electrode. The combined effects between the three components in the ternary composite aerogels taking advantage of both charging and faradaic processes can readily explain the excellent electrochemical performance.

The study of structure-property correlation of AIE luminogens is of high importance for the design and application of new AIE luminogens. In this contribution, we synthesized two pairs of tetraphenylethene-phenanthro[9,10-d] imidazole conjugates, and investigated the structure-property correlation of the luminogens. The optical properties, fluorescence lifetimes, electronic structures, electrochemical properties, and electroluminescence properties of the luminogens were comparatively studied. It was found that embedding benzo-2,1,3-thiadiazole moieties into the molecular backbones not only tuned the fluorescence feature of aggregation-enhanced emission to moderate aggregation-caused quenching, but also strongly red-shifted the fluorescence of luminogens from sky-blue to red. The underlying mechanism of this phenomenon was studied and discussed combined with theoretical calculation results. Undoped organic light-emitting diodes with varied electroluminescence colors and good performances are fabricated using these luminogens as light-emitting layers.

Few studies have taken a whole-brain perspective in the functional connectivity (FC) analysis of these two disorders in resting state. It limits the ability to identify regionally and psychopathologically specific network abnormalities with their subsequent use as diagnostic marker and novel treatment strategy. The whole brain FC using a novel FC metric was compared, that is, scaled correlation, which they demonstrated to be a reliable FC statistics, but have higher statistical power in two-sample t-test of whole brain FC analysis. About 21 GAD and 18 PD patients were compared with 22 matched control subjects during resting-state, respectively. It was found that GAD patients demonstrated increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus among the most significantly changed FC, while PD was mainly associated with greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus. Besides such regional specificity, it was observed that psychopathological specificity in that the disrupted FC pattern in PD and GAD correlated with their respective symptom severity. The findings suggested that the increased FC between hippocampus/parahippocampus and fusiform gyrus in GAD were mainly associated with a fear generalization related neural circuit, while the greater FC between somatosensory cortex and thalamus in PD were more likely linked to interoceptive processing. Due to the observed regional and psychopathological specificity, their findings bear important clinical implications for the potential treatment strategy. Hum Brain Mapp 37:1459-1473, 2016.

The coercivity (H-c) exhibits unusual temperature dependence. As temperature increases, it decreases at first, then goes up to the maximum and keeps it in medium temperature range, finally drops rapidly and disappears at T-N. The exchange bias field (H-E) is negative initially and its magnitude decreases monotonically with increasing temperature, then it turns to be positive, finally disappears at high temperatures. The anomalous H-c(T) behavior may be ascribed to the non-collinear coupling interaction at the FeMn/Gd interface. The positive HE can be attributed to the antiferromagnetic coupling between the interfacial Gd and FeMn moments. Moreover, the anti ferromagnetic ordering adjacent to the FeMn layer may be responsible for inducing the exchange coupling at T-C< T < T-N. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, we isolated an EMS-mutagenized rice mutant displaying abaxial rolling and vein-albino leaves, and thus designated it as Osarvl4. Compared to the wild type 'Nipponbare', Osarvl4 mutant had abnormal development of clear cells, parenchyma cells, sclerenchymatous cells, mesophyll cells, bulliform cells and vascular bundles. As a result of the defective leaf development, the chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency were significantly affected in the mutant. Genetic analysis using map-based cloning indicated that the mutation was controlled by a single recessive karyogene localized within a 44 kb region on the long arm of chromosome 4. Sequence analysis and alignment indicated that the three candidate genes in this region showed no difference at the DNA level. However, quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that the expression of the LOC_Os04g33580 gene in the mutant was significantly lower than that of wild type, while expression of the other two candidate genes (LOC_Os04g33560 and LOC_Os04g33570) exhibited no significant difference. Therefore, we speculate that LOC_Os04g33580 might be the target gene which regulates leaf vein development and leaf morphogenesis in rice and this locus might be subject to epigenetic regulation, such as DNA methylation, Thus, our finding suggests that the OsARVL4 gene is involved in the regulation of chlorophyll content and photosynthetic efficiency in plants, and provides a genetic basis for the future study of genes related to leaf development in rice.

It has also been proposed that such spontaneous activity, particularly in the default-mode network (DMN), is involved in self-related processing. We therefore hypothesised that pre-stimulus activity levels in the DMN predict whether a stimulus is judged as self-related or not. Participants were presented in the MRI scanner with a white noise stimulus that they were instructed contained their name or another. They then had to respond with which name they thought they heard. Regions where there was an activity level difference between self and other response trials 2 s prior to the stimulus being presented were identified. Pre-stimulus activity levels were higher in the right temporoparietal junction, the right temporal pole and the left superior temporal gyrus in trials where the participant responded that they heard their own name than trials where they responded that they heard another. Pre-stimulus spontaneous activity levels in particular brain regions, largely overlapping with the DMN, predict the subsequent judgement of stimuli as self-related. This extends our current knowledge of self-related processing and its apparent relationship with intrinsic brain activity in what can be termed a rest-self overlap.

The influence of NaOH concentration, hydrothermal and calcination temperature on the structural and textural properties of the final products was investigated. Increasing the NaOH concentration gave rise to the transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic and then to tetragonal phase, whereas the increase of hydrothermal temperature led to the tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation. As the NaOH concentration and hydrothermal temperature were increased, a narrow pore size distribution was turned into a multi-modal pore size distribution resulting from regular mesopores and interparticle voids. Accordingly, the incorporated sulfonate anions were oxidized into sulphate anions. After the calcination of 550 A degrees C, the sulfonated products possessed tetragonal crystalline phase with average pore diameter of 4.2 nm and surface area of 108 m(2)g(-1).

J	Hu, GS; Sheng, A; Zhang, YZ; Pan, ZG; Zhang, MM				Hu, Guosheng; Sheng, Ai; Zhang, Yizhong; Pan, Zhigeng; Zhang, Mingmin			An analytic measure of perceptual factors for color composition	COLOR RESEARCH AND APPLICATION			English	Article						color gestalt; composition factor; perceptual modeling; composition evaluation	SPATIAL BALANCE; HARMONY	Color images are usually observed as integrated objects, or called color gestalt. That is why color effect of image is not only affected by the color components themselves, but also determined remarkably by the image constructive frame, which holds the colors. Although, previous researchers have already explored this issue, the conclusions are usually descriptive principles that one should keep in mind for color designing. Precise quantification for image composition of color gestalt is still an ignored field in color research domain. As the use of computer-aided design (CAD) increases in the color design field, more quantifiable measures for constructive feature factors that affect color gestalt are needed. In this article, we introduce a three-dimensional model of image composition that can both quantify the effect of color gestalt and rebuild image composition to acquire certain color effect for color combination. This method pioneers a new perspective of appreciating the influence of image construction on color combination effect, and a new way of researching color by affective computing or Kansei engineering technology. To test the feasibility of the scale model by a usage study, an interactive toolkit was also built. Practice has confirmed that this method is a technical meaning in application technically meaningful approach, and will spur further research on color composition. (c) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Chrysanthemum morifolium plants are important commercial herbs in China, widely used in ornamental horticulture and traditional medicine. In this study, start codon targeted (SCoT) polymorphic markers were applied to assess genetic relationships among 32 populations of C. morifolium. Thirty-two SCoT primers produced 872 loci, 90% (785) of which showed polymorphism. Average polymorphism information content of the SCoT primers was 0.987 (0.950-0.993), showing that plenty of genetic diversity exists among Chinese C morifolium cultivars. Cluster analysis of SCoT markers (based on UPGMA and PCoA method) grouped all the cultivars of C morifolium into two clusters. The partition of clusters in the dendrogram and PCoA plot was similar and large degree of grouping according to their origin and ecological distribution. Our results will provide much more useful information for C morifolium germplasm resource protection and will also useful to improve the current plant breeding programs. Our results also indicated that SCoT markers are informative and could be used to evaluate genetic diversity of Chinese medicinal C morifolium cultivars. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Here, SmGGPPS (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase) and SmDXSII (1-deoxy-ri-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase) were introduced into hairy roots of S. miltiorrhiza. Overexpression of SmGGPPS and SmDXSII in hairy roots produces higher levels of tanshinone than control and single-gene transformed lines; tanshinone production in the double-gene transformed line GDII10 reached 12.93 mg/g dry weight, which is the highest tanshinone content that has been achieved through genetic engineering. Furthermore, transgenic hairy root lines showed higher antioxidant and antitumor activities than control lines. In addition, contents of chlorophylls, carotenoids, indoleacetic acid, and gibberellins were significantly elevated in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants. These results demonstrate a promising method to improve the production of diterpenoids including tanshinone as well as other natural plastid-derived isoprenoids in plants by genetic manipulation of the 2-Ctrnethyl,p-erythritoI-4-phosphate (MEP) pathway.

These analytes were extracted from honey and milk using chitosan-modified graphitized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (G-MWNTs) as the solid sorbent and acetonitrile/acetic acid (8:2, v/v) as the eluent in miniaturized SPE. Under the optimum experimental conditions, a satisfactory linearity (r(2) > 0.992) was obtained, and the limits of detection were in the range of 0.61-10.34 mu g/kg for the analytes. The mean recoveries of the five tetracycline antibiotic residues in the real samples were between 81.5 and 101.4%. The results demonstrated that chitosan-modified G-MWNTs comprise a promising material for the enrichment of tetracycline antibiotics from complex food matrices.

For ectothermic animals - especially frogs - it remains undetermined whether HIF-1 alpha and its target genes (VEGF and TF) play an important role in high altitude adaptation, too. In this study, we compared the gene sequences and expression of HIF-1a and its target genes (VEGF and TF) between three Nanorana parkeri populations from different altitudes (3008 m a.s.l., 3440 m a.s.l. and 4312 m a.s.l.). We observed that the cDNA sequences of HIF-1A exhibited high sequence similarity (99.38%) among the three altitudinally separated populations; but with increasing altitude, the expression of HIF-1A and its target genes (VEGF and TF) increased significantly. These results indicate that HIF-1 alpha plays an important role in N. parkeri adaptation to the high altitude, similar to its role in endothennic animals.

Nanorana parkeri is an anuran endemic to the southern Tibetan Plateau where it has an extensive altitudinal range (2850 to 5100 m asp. Low oxygen concentration is one of the main environmental characteristics of the Tibetan Plateau. Hypoxia-inducible factor alpha subunits (HIF-1 alpha and HIF-2 alpha, encoded by Endothelial PAS domain protein 1 (EPAS1)) and associated genes (e.g., vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and Erythropoietin (EPO)) play crucial roles in maintaining oxygen homeostasis. In this study, we compared the expression of HIF-1A, VEGF, EPAS1 and EPO mRNA between two populations of N. parkeri: one population inhabiting the native high altitudes, and the second living in, and being acclimated to, the lower plains (70 m asl). The expression of HIF-1A, VEGF and EPAS1 mRNA in the high altitude population were significantly higher than in the acclimated population, whereas there was no significant difference for EPO between two groups. Our results indicated that gene expression plasticity may make significant contributions to local adaptation of species that have broad altitudinal distributions. In addition, we deepen our understanding of the adaptive potential of this species by evaluating the experiments in the scope of its evolutionary history.

However, whether Sox11 is primarily involved in the regulation of palatogenesis still remains elusive. In this study, we explored the role of Sox11 in palatogenesis by analyzing the developmental mechanism in cleft palate formation in mutants deficient in Sox11. Sox11 is expressed both in the developing palatal shelf and in the surrounding structures, including the mandible. We found that cleft palate occurs only in the mutant in which Sox11 is directly deleted. As in the wild type, the palatal shelves in the Sox11 mutant undergo outgrowth in a downward direction and exhibit potential for fusion and elevation. However, mutant palatal shelves encounter clefting, which is associated with a malpositioned tongue that results in physical obstruction of palatal shelf elevation at embryonic day 14.5 (E14.5). We found that loss of Sox11 led to reduced cell proliferation in the developing mandibular mesenchyme via Cyclin D1, leading to mandibular hypoplasia, which blocks tongue descent. Extensive analyses of gene expression in Sox11 deficiency identified FGF9 as a potential candidate target of Sox11 in the modulation of cell proliferation both in the mandible and the palatal shelf between E12.5 and E13.5. Finally we show, using in vitro assays, that Sox11 directly regulates the expression of Fgf9 and that application of FGF9 protein to Sox11-deficient palatal shelves restores the rate of BrdU incorporation. Taken together, the palate defects presented in the Sox11 loss mutant mimic the clefting in the Pierre Robin sequence in humans.

While the microRNA miR-221 is involved in embryonic lung branching morphogenesis and epithelial cell development, its importance in lung inflammation has not been previously explored. In our current study, expression of miR-221 was selectively decreased by exposure to lipopolysaccharides (LPS) both in vitro and in vivo. Enforced expression of miR-221 significantly increased the production of proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IL-6, and enhanced the activation of NF-kappa B and MAPKs upon LPS stimulation. Accordingly, intratracheal stimulation of miR-221 was shown to aggravate endotoxin-induced acute lung injuries and inflammation in mice. Mechanistic studies showed that miR-221 directly targets A20, a master regulator of NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling, and thus represses inflammatory signaling. Restoration of A20 in macrophages abolished the stimulatory effect of miR-221 on production of proinflammatory cytokines. Together, these results indicate the presence of a novel miRNA-mediated feed-back mechanism that controls inflammation, and suggest involvement of aberrant miR-221 expression in the development of inflammatory lung disorders.

The aim of our study was to test the hypothesis that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD may be related to atrophy of special gray matter regions. Methods: High-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of the brains and comprehensive cognitive function tests were acquired in 37 PD patients and 21 healthy controls (HC) from September 2013 to October 2014. Patients were divided into two groups: PD with MCI (PD-MCI, n =18) and PD with normal cognition (PDNC, n = 19). Gray matter density differences were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). VBM and cognitive results, UPDRS scores and Hoehn-Yahr stages were compared between PD-MCI, PDCN and HC group, and correlation analyses were performed between those brain areas and cognition scores, UPDRS scores and disease duration, which showed significant group differences. Results: The demographic data and motor severity among three groups were similar. However, comprehensive cognitive function results were more severe in PD-MCI than the other two groups. Compared to the HC group, the PDNC group showed reductions in gray matter density in frontal, temporal, parietal, bilateral insula lobes and many other regions of brain. Besides above changes, the PD-MCI group also revealed gray matter concentration decrease in left hippocampus and thalamus, and these changes still remained when compared with the PDNC group. The HC group did not show any more areas of atrophy in gray matter than others. Gray matter loss in PD represented significant correlations with global cognitive scores, motor severity or disease duration in some of these atrophic regions. Conclusion: The initial stages of cognitive function decline in patients with PD is closely associated with gray matter atrophy in left hippocampus and thalamus. These two regions may serve as potential imaging biomarkers for PD-MCI. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The channel structure with large amount of uncovered TPU was confirmed by wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). High performance poly(oxymethylene) (POM) alloys were fabricated by simply melt mixing neat POM with the synthesized TPU inclusion complex (IC-TPU). The effects of the incorporation of IC-TPU on the structure and properties of POM have been investigated. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) results showed that IC-TPU was dispersed uniformly in POM matrix and there was robust interface between IC-TPU and POM matrix. Tensile test results indicated significant improvement in both strength and ductility of the IC-TPU modified POM as compared with neat POM. Moreover, the incorporation of IC-TPU resulted in the drastically enhanced thermal stability of POM. The initial degradation temperature increased as high as 40 degrees C with the addition of a small amount of IC-TPU. The investigation indicated that the IC-TPU exhibited a novel structure with a soft shell (uncovered TPU) and a hard core (beta-CD covered TPU segments). Such "soft shell-hard core" structure improves not only the elongation at break but also the tensile strength of POM. The superior thermal stability was originated from the synergetic effects of the hydroxyl groups in beta-CDs and the amino groups in TPU. The multifunctional effect of the IC-TPU opens a new avenue for the industrial application of POM.

However, detailed investigations of the 14-3-3 gene family in Medicago truncatula are largely unknown. In this study, the identification and study of M. truncatula 14-3-3-family genes were performed based on the latest M. truncatula genome. In the M. truncatula genome, 10 14-3-3 family genes were identified, and they can be grouped into epsilon and non-E groups. An exon-intron analysis showed that the gene structures are conserved in the same group. The protein structure analysis showed that 14-3-3 proteins in M. truncatula are composed of nine typical antiparallel alpha-helices. The expression patterns of Mt14-3-3 genes indicated that they are expressed in all tissues. Furthermore, the gene expression levels of Mt14-3-3 under hormone treatment and Sinorhizobium meliloti infection showed that the Mt14-3-3 genes were involve in nodule formation. Our findings lay a solid foundation for further functional studies of 14-3-3 in M. truncatula.

Resting-state functional MRI data was acquired from mTLE patients before (n = 37) and after (n = 24) anterior temporal lobectomy. According to surgical outcome, patients were classified as seizure-free (SF, n = 14) or non-seizure-free (NSF, n = 10). First, we found higher network resilience to targeted attack on topologically central nodes in the SF group compared to the NSF group, preoperatively. Next, a two-way mixed analysis of variance with between-subject factor 'outcome' (SF vs. NSF) and within-subject factor 'treatment' (pre-operation vs. post-operation) revealed divergent dynamic reorganization in nodal topological characteristics between groups, in the temporoparietal junction and its connection with the ventral prefrontal cortex. We also correlated the network damage score (caused by surgical resection) with postsurgical brain function, and found that the damage score negatively correlated with postoperative global and local parallel information processing. Taken together, dynamic connectomic architecture provides vital information for selecting surgical candidates and for understanding brain recovery mechanisms following epilepsy surgery.

The promoting effect of the reaction stabilizers for the polymerization of D3F was investigated by GPC and NMR analyses. Results showed that the selected reaction stabilizers exhibited a significant promoting effect. This new process of polymerization produced well-defined alpha,omega-dihydroxylated polysiloxane in very high yields. The addition of reaction stabilizers could almost completely suppress back-biting reactions during the polymerization. It was found that there lies an exponential decay relationship between the molecular weight of PTFPMS-OH and amount of end-capping agent. Thus, by adjusting the reaction conditions strictly, the molecular weight of the fluorosilicone could be controlled accurately, and meanwhile a broad "terminate window" could be implemented. Thermogravimetic (TG) analysis indicated that PTFPMS-OH could be used in a wide range of operational temperatures. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Appl. Polym. Sci. 2016, 133, 43220.

Herein, we report a novel approach to activating remote C-H bonds at the C5 position of 8-aminoquinoline through copper-catalyzed sulfonylation under mild conditions. Our strategy shows high conversion efficiency, a broad substrate scope, and good toleration with different functional groups. Furthermore, our mechanistic investigations suggest that a single-electron-transfer process plays a vital role in generating sulfonyl radicals and subsequently initiating C-S cross-coupling. Importantly, our copper-catalyzed remote functionalization protocol can be expanded for the construction of a variety of chemical bonds, including C-O, C-Br, C-N, C-C, and C-I. These findings provide a fundamental insight into the activation of remote C-H bonds, while offering new possibilities for rational design of drug molecules and optoelectronic materials requiring specific modification of functional groups.

We obtain the quantum Cramer-Rao bounds for both the linear and nonlinear parametrization protocols. Through analysis utilizing simultaneous estimation. we find that this generalized form of ECS gives better precision than the generalized NOON states (2013 Phys. Rev. Lett. 111 070403). Moreover, when compared with the independent estimation both the linear and nonlinear protocols have the same advantage in the relation to the number of parameters.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of J/Psi -> p(p)over-bar phi at BESIII	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							THRESHOLD ENHANCEMENT; DECAYS; STATE	Using a data sample of 1.31 x 10(9) J/Psi events accumulated with the BESIII detector, the decay J/Psi -> p (p) over bar phi is studied via two decay modes, phi -> (KSKL0)-K-0 and phi -> K+K-. The branching fraction of J/Psi -> p (p) over bar phi is measured to be B(J/Psi -> p (p) over bar phi) = [5.23 +/- 0.06(stat) +/- 0.33(syst)] x 10(- 5), which agrees well with a previously published measurement, but with a significantly improved precision. No evident enhancement near the p (p) over bar mass threshold, denoted as X(p (p) over bar), is observed, and the upper limit on the branching fraction of J/Psi -> X(p (p) over bar)phi -> p (p) over bar phi is determined to be B(J/Psi -> X(p (p) over bar)phi -> p (p) over bar phi) < 2.1 x 10(- 7) at the 90% confidence level.

A novel modelling method with convenient and parametric performances is introduced to generate the dexterous-finger reachable workspace. This method constructs the geometric topology of the dexterous-finger reachable workspace, and uses a joint feature recognition algorithm to extract the kinematical parameters of the dexterous finger. Compared with graphic, analytical and numerical methods, this parametric modelling method can automatically and conveniently construct a more vivid workspace's forms and contours of the dexterous finger. The main contribution of this paper is that a workspace-modelling tool with high interactive efficiency is developed for designers to precisely visualize the dexterous-finger reachable workspace, which is valuable for analysing the flexibility of the dexterous finger.

However, WM alterations in the different phases of BD remain to be explored. The aims of this study is to investigate the WM alterations in the various phases of illness and their correlations with clinical and neurocognitive features. Methods: We investigated the DTI -derived fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), radial diffusivity (RD) and axial diffusivity (AD) in patients with type I BD (n=61) subdivided in manic (n=21), depressive (n=20) and euthymic phases (n=20) vs. healthy controls (n=42), using a tract -based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach. Then, we investigated whether the subgroups of patients in the various phases of illness present different patterns of WM abnormalities. Finally we studied the correlations between WM alterations and clinical -cognitive parameters. Results: We found a widespread alteration in WM microstructure (decrease in FA and increase in MD and RD) in BD when compared to controls. The various subgroups of BD showed different spatial patterns of WM alterations. A gradient of increasing WM abnormalities from the euthymic (low degree and localized WM alterations mainly in the midline structures) to the manic (more diffuse WM alterations affecting both midline and lateral structures) and, finally, to the depressive phase (high degree and widespread WM alterations), was found. Furthermore, the WM diffuse alterations correlated with cognitive deficits in BD, such as decreased fluency prompted by letter and decreased hits and increased omission errors at the continuous performance test. Limitations: Patients under treatment. Conclusions: The WM alterations in type I BD showed different spatial patterns in the various phases of illness, mainly affecting the active phases, and correlated with some cognitive deficits. This suggests a complex trait- and state -dependent pathogenesis of WM abnormalities in BD. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It enables us to investigate continuous measurement of a qubit on the level of single quantum trajectories, where essential correlations between the inherent dynamics of the qubit and detector current fluctuations are revealed. Based on this unraveling scheme, feedback control of the charge qubit is implemented to achieve a desired pure state in the presence of the detailed-balance condition. With sufficient feedback strength, coherent oscillations of the measured qubit can be maintained for arbitrary qubit-detector coupling. Competition between the loss and restoration of coherence entailed, respectively, by measurement back action and feedback control is reflected in the noise power spectrum of the detector's output. It is demonstrated unambiguously that the signal-to-noise ratio is significantly enhanced with increasing feedback strength and could even exceed the well-known Korotkov-Averin bound in quantum measurement. The proposed unraveling and feedback scheme offers a transparent and straightforward approach to effectively sustaining ideal coherent oscillations of a charge qubit in the field of quantum computation.

J	Shi, XM; Shan, ZY; Zhao, N				Shi, Xingmin; Shan, Zhenyu; Zhao, Na			Learning for an aesthetic model for estimating the traffic state in the traffic video	NEUROCOMPUTING			English	Article						Aesthetic model; Traffic state; Random forest; Perceptual feature	SCENE; SYSTEM; GAZE	With the increasing number of vehicles running on the urban roads, the traffic jam becomes much more serious. Properly estimating the traffic jam level from traffic videos is essential for the department of transportation management and drivers. Currently, for estimating the traffic state on videos, most solutions are built on evaluating traffic flow by counting the running vehicles per time unit or detecting their moving speed. However, the main challenge of these solutions is on the vehicle tracking method, in which the vehicles are necessary to be effectively and integrally segmented from the scenes. The solutions should tradeoff the accuracy of the estimation results and the efficiency of the method. In this paper, we propose a learning-based aesthetic model to estimate the traffic state on videos. The model uses multiple video-based perceptual features about traffic state to train the random forest classifier with the labeled data, and estimates traffic state by data classification. The evaluation experiments are conducted on a testing image set, and the results show that the traffic state estimation accuracy of the proposed model is higher than 98% and the efficiency performance is achieved in real-time.

In this paper, we put forward an access control with authentication scheme for disseminated messages in VANETs. In the scheme, we integrate pseudonym with identity based signature (IBS) which could not only authenticate the messages in vehicular communication, but also protect the privacy of message generators. When vehicles receive numerous messages that need to be authenticated in a short time, we also apply batch verification to improve the efficiency of message disseminating. Then we adopt ciphertext policy attribute based encryption (CP-ABE), which provides access control service to set expressive and flexible access structure for the specified vehicles in VANETs communication. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme is efficient in message authentication and access control for vehicular communication in VANETs. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is a networked system which includes the front-end image acquisition system and the back-end data processing platform. In the front-end acquisition system, after recording the image data the front-end processing system analyzes the image data and automatically extracts some information of the passing vehicles, such as time, location, direction, the number and color of license plate, etc. After that, the information is sent to the back-end data processing platform for deeper analysis, such as vehicle trajectory tracking and traffic state estimation. However, as the data scales to a great amount, it becomes difficult for traditional analysis framework and tools to meet the requirement of big data analysis. HBase is the column-oriented database based on Hadoop, along with Map-Reduce programming paradigm. It can deal with the problems in processing big data that intelligent monitoring and recording system faces nowadays. In this paper, a big traffic data processing framework using HBase to analyze the data of IMRS is proposed. The performance of the proposed framework is compared with the Oracle strategy on three different kinds of applications, and the experimental results show that the proposed strategy is with promising performance in computation latency.

A linear combination of the Davydov D-1 (D-2) ansatz, referred to as the "multi-D-1, ansatz" ("multi-D-2 ansatz"), is used as the trial state with enhanced accuracy but without sacrificing efficiency. The time evolution of the exciton probability is found to be in perfect agreement with that of the hierarchy equations of motion, demonstrating the promise the multiple Davydov trial states hold as an efficient, robust description of dynamics of complex quantum systems. In addition to the linear absorption spectra computed for both diagonal and off-diagonal cases, for the first time, 2D spectra have been calculated for systems with off-diagonal exciton-phonon coupling by employing the multiple D-2 ansatz to compute the nonlinear response function, testifying to the great potential of the multiple D-2 ansatz for fast, accurate implementation of multidimensional spectroscopy. It is found that the signal exhibits a single peak for weak off-diagonal coupling, while a vibronic multipeak structure appears for strong off-diagonal coupling.

Thus far, it lacks a general method to transform network organizing mechanisms to link prediction algorithms. Here we use an algorithmic framework where a network's probability is calculated according to a predefined structural Hamiltonian that takes into account the network organizing principles, and a non-observed link is scored by the conditional probability of adding the link to the observed network. Extensive numerical simulations show that the proposed algorithm has remarkably higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art methods in uncovering missing links and identifying spurious links in many complex biological and social networks. Such method also finds applications in exploring the underlying network evolutionary mechanisms.

The crux of this matter is to find the critical nodes whose removal will lead to network collapse. This paper studies the disintegration of networks with incomplete link information. An effective method is proposed to find the critical nodes by the assistance of link prediction techniques. Extensive experiments in both synthetic and real networks suggest that, by using link prediction method to recover partial missing links in advance, the method can largely improve the network disintegration performance. Besides, to our surprise, we find that when the size of missing information is relatively small, our method even outperforms than the results based on complete information. We refer to this phenomenon as the "comic effect" of link prediction, which means that the network is reshaped through the addition of some links that identified by link prediction algorithms, and the reshaped network is like an exaggerated but characteristic comic of the original one, where the important parts are emphasized.

It is explicitly shown that the systematic error in the Rabi frequency of the control fields affects these two kinds of gates in different ways. In the presence of this systematic error, the transformation produced by the nonadiabatic non-Abelian geometric gate is not unitary in the computational space, and the resulting gate infidelity is larger than that with the dynamical method. Our results provide a theoretical basis for choosing a suitable method for implementing elementary quantum gates in physical systems, where the systematic noises are the dominant noise source.

Currently most studies revealing OBE probed an 'irrelevant-change distracting effect', where changes of irrelevant-features dramatically affected the performance of the target feature. However, the existence of irrelevant-feature change may affect participants' processing manner, leading to a false-positive result. The current study conducted a strict examination of OBE in VWM, by probing whether irrelevant-features guided the deployment of attention in visual search. The participants memorized an object's colour yet ignored shape and concurrently performed a visual-search task. They searched for a target line among distractor lines, each embedded within a different object. One object in the search display could match the shape, colour, or both dimensions of the memory item, but this object never contained the target line. Relative to a neutral baseline, where there was no match between the memory and search displays, search time was significantly prolonged in all match conditions, regardless of whether the memory item was displayed for 100 or 1000 ms. These results suggest that task-irrelevant shape was extracted into VWM, supporting OBE in VWM.

Still, the functions of OsGLRs in rice, especially the ion channel activities, are largely unknown. Results: Using the aequorin-based luminescence imaging system, we screened the specificity of amino acids involved in the induction of Ca2+ flux in rice roots. Of all the amino acids tested, glutamate (Glu) was the only one to trigger Ca2+ flux significantly in rice roots. Detailed analysis showed a dose response of Ca2+ increase to different concentrations of Glu. In addition, the Ca2+ spike response to Glu was rapid, within 20 s after the application. A desensitization assay and pharmacological tests showed that the Glu-triggered Ca2+ flux is mediated by OsGLRs. Whole genome analysis identified 13 OsGLR genes in rice, and these genes have various expression patterns in different tissues. Subcellular localization studies showed that all the OsGLRs examined are likely localized to the plasma membrane. Bacteria growth assays showed that at least OsGLR2.1 and OsGLR3.2 have the potential to mediate ion uptake in bacteria. Further analysis using Fura-2-based Ca2+ imaging revealed a Glu-triggered Ca2+ increase in OsGLR2.1-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. Conclusions: Our work provides a molecular basis for investigating mechanisms of Glu-triggered Ca2+ flux in rice.

The bridge N-N bond length of 1 (1.70 angstrom) is the longest among those of known N-N singly-bonded compounds, including side-on bridged transition-metal dinitrogen complexes. The compound 1 is intact in air but moisture sensitive. No reaction occurs with hydrogen, even under pressure at 0.5MPa. Irradiation of 1 with light gives an isomer quantitatively by N-N and adamantyl C-C bond cleavage. The origin of the remarkable N-N bond elongation is ascribed to significant interaction between a Si-C sigma* and - and sigma orbitals as determined by DFT calculations of model compounds.

Although a considerable amount of work has been dedicated to the design of DCS schemes, the confusions of the security notions in the existing DCS models have not been formally discussed and clarified to achieve a proper level of confirmer's security. In order to achieve provable security, we propose a reduced security model and prove that a DCS cryptosystem only requires transcript-simulatability or alternatively invisibility plus non transferability from a modelling perspective. Accompanied by the reduced DCS model, a generic DCS scheme is also constructed that still retains the feature of full verification, i.e., either the signer or the confirmer can interactively verify arbitrary signatures by providing a convincing proof. Our proposed scheme employs a computationally binding commitment scheme, together with an IND-CCA2 secure public encryption scheme, to achieve a provable security in the standard model. Meanwhile, we present an efficient concrete instantiation by using BLS signatures, CS-Paillier encryption scheme with labels, and Perdesen commitment scheme. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

In this work, we firstly reported that HNTS were solely employed as a solid acid catalyst for alkenylation of diverse aromatics with phenylacetylene to their alpha-arylstyrenes. It was found that the HNT with a facile ion exchange and calcination pretreatment demonstrated outstanding catalytic performance in alkenylation of p-xylene with phenylacetylene, and 95.6% of phenylacetylene conversion with 95.8% of selectivity toward alpha-(2,5-dimenthylphenyl) styrene was achieved. The HNT were characterized by N-2 physisorption, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), NH3 temperature programmed desorption (NH3-TPD), pyridine infrared spectroscopy (Py-IR), and Inductively coupled plasma (ICP), and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) techniques. Correlated the nature of HNTs to reaction results, it was revealed that the catalytic performance of HNT was significantly dependent on their acidic properties and textural feature notably affected by ion exchange times (N-IE) and calcination temperature (T-c). Especially, besides acidic properties, the nature of the formed mesopores on the walls of HNTs strongly affects the catalytic activity, selectivity and coke-deposition behavior. The appropriate acidic sites and their accessibility are essential for obtaining satisfactory catalytic performance. The modified HNT catalyzed alkenylation can be extended to diverse substrates with good catalytic properties for diverse alpha-arylstyrenes production. The combination of excellent catalytic properties and the facile regeneration of deactivated HNT by calcination process allows it to be a promising candidate for, but limited to alkenylation of aromatics with phenylacetylene to their alpha-arylstyrenes.

The short-term effects of various concentrations,of Cu2+ on the denitrifying bacteria were evaluated using batch assays. The specific denitrifying activity (SDA) decreased from 14.3 +/- 2.2 (without Cu2+) to 6.1 +/- 0.1 mg N h(-1) g(-1) VSS (100 mgCu(2+) L-1) when Cu2+ increased from 0 to 100 mg L-1 with an increment of 10 mgCu(2+) L-1. A non-competitive inhibition model was used to calculate the 50% inhibition concentration (IC50) of Cu2+ on denitrifying sludge (30.6 +/- 2.5 mg L-1). Monod and Luong models were applied to investigate the influence of the initial substrate concentration, and the results suggested that the maximum substrate removal rate would be reduced with Cu2+ supplementation. Pre-exposure to Cu2+ could lead to an 18.2-46.2% decrease in the SDA and decreasing percentage of the SDA increased with both exposure time and concentration. In the continuous-flow test, Cu2+ concentration varied from 1 to 75 mg L-1; however, no clear deterioration was observed in the reactor, and the reactor was kept stable, with the total nitrogen removal efficiency and total organic carbon efficiency greater than 89.0 and 85.0%, respectively. The results demonstrated the short-term inhibition of Cu2+ upon denitrification, and no notable adversity was observed during the continuous-flow test after long-term acclimation.

The structures of the analytes were characterized and determined via quadrupole time of-flight tandem mass spectrometry and nuclear magnetic resonance. Under optimum conditions, 25 mg of sample was dispersed with 75 mg of beta-CD, and 0.5 mL of methanol was used as the elution solvent. The proposed method produced a good linearity (r(2) > 0.99) for the isomers, with limits of detection ranging from 1.62 to 3.33 ng/mL. The average recovery values that were obtained from analyzing the spiked samples were calculated to be in the range of 87.04-105.20%. Moreover, the trace MSPD method required less reagents and a shorter extraction time in comparison with the traditional pharmacopoeia method and other reported approaches. The developed method was successfully applied for the determination of three real honeysuckle samples that were collected from different cultivated areas. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The detection of cancer cells is extremely important for early diagnosis and clinical treatments. At present, the pretreatment for the detection of cancer cells is costly, complicated and time-consuming. As different species of the analytes may give rise to specific voltammetric signals at distinctly different potentials, simple potential sensing has the specificity to detect different cellular species. By taking advantage of the different electrochemical characteristics of normal cells, cancer cells and biointeractions between anticancer drugs and cancer cells, we develop a specific, sensitive, direct, cost-effective and rapid method for the detection of cancer cells by electrochemical potential sensing based on Au/TiO2 nanobelt heterostructure electrodes that will be of significance in early cancer diagnosis, in vitro screening of anticancer drugs and molecular biology research.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for a light CP-odd Higgs boson in radiative decays of J/psi	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							LEPTONIC DECAYS; STANDARD MODEL; QUARKONIUM; EXTENSION; FACTORIES; EVENTS; GAMMA	We search for a light Higgs boson A(0) in the fully reconstructed decay chain of J/psi -> gamma A(0), A(0)-> mu(+)mu(-) using (225.0 +/- 2.8) x 10(6) J/psi events collected by the BESIII experiment. The A(0) is a hypothetical CP-odd light Higgs boson predicted by many extensions of the Standard Model including two spin-0 doublets plus an extra singlet. We find no evidence for A(0) production and set 90% confidence-level upper limits on the product branching fraction B(J/psi -> gamma A(0)) x B(A(0)-> mu(+)mu(-)) in the range of (2.8-495.3) x 10(-8) for 0.212 <= mA(0) <= 3.0 GeV/c(2). The new limits are five times below our previous results, and the nature of the A(0) is constrained to be mostly singlet.	[Deng, Z. Y.; Li, F.; Li, G.; Li, H. B.; Li, J. C.; Li, W. D.; Li, W.

J	Herbert, C; Blume, C; Northoff, G				Herbert, Cornelia; Blume, Christine; Northoff, Georg			Can we distinguish an "I" and "ME" during listening?-an event-related EEG study on the processing of first and second person personal and possessive pronouns	SELF AND IDENTITY			English	Article						insula; first and second person perspective; Me; pronouns; I; Self; language; medial prefrontal cortex; event-related brain potentials; cortical midline structures (CMS)	PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SELF-AWARENESS; POTENTIALS; BRAIN; SIMULATION; INSULA	Theoretically, stimuli can be related to the self as subject ("I") or object ("ME") of experience. This event-related brain potential (ERP) study investigated whether listening to personal and possessive pronouns elicits different modes of self-processing regarding time-course and neural sources. Going beyond previous research, first (1PP) and second person (2PP) pronouns were included to determine the specificity of self-processing. Participants listened passively to German pronouns while the electroencephalogram was recorded. Modulation of ERPs revealed a processing advantage for the 2PP personal pronoun "du" ("you") already in early time windows. Regarding possessive pronouns, N1 amplitudes indicated increased attention orientation to the 1PP pronoun "mein" ("my"), whereas during later time windows, processing of 1PP and 2PP possessive pronouns did not differ but differed from the third person pronoun "sein" ("his"). ERP source imaging suggests that primary sensory brain regions (auditory cortex), the insula and cortical midline structures are differentially involved into these two processing modes. The results support the idea of distinct self-processing modes ("I" and "ME") and confirm their dynamic nature. Moreover, they demonstrate that on a neural level neither "I" or "ME" are invariantly tied to the first person, in line with the hypothesis that self-processing is relational and context-dependent.

J	Robinson, JD; Wagner, NF; Northoff, G				Robinson, Jeffrey D.; Wagner, Nils-Frederic; Northoff, Georg			Is the Sense of Agency in Schizophrenia Influenced by Resting-State Variation in Self-Referential Regions of the Brain?	SCHIZOPHRENIA BULLETIN			English	Article						self; agency; schizophrenia; resting-state activity; default mode network; source monitoring hypothesis	DEFAULT-MODE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; NETWORK; PHENOMENOLOGY; METAANALYSIS; EXPERIENCE; AWARENESS; SYMPTOMS; ABNORMALITIES; AUTHORSHIP	Schizophrenia is a disturbance of the self, of which the attribution of agency is a major component. In this article, we review current theories of the Sense of Agency, their relevance to schizophrenia, and propose a novel framework for future research. We explore some of the models of agency, in which both bottom-up and top-down processes are implicated in the genesis of agency. We further this line of inquiry by suggesting that ongoing neurological activity (the brain's resting state) in self-referential regions of the brain can provide a deeper level of influence beyond what the current models capture. Based on neuroimaging studies, we suggest that aberrant activity in regions such as the default mode network of individuals with schizophrenia can lead to a misattribution of internally/externally generated stimuli. This can result in symptoms such as thought insertion and delusions of control. Consequently, neuroimaging can contribute to a more comprehensive conceptualization and measurement of agency and potential treatment implications.

The phytochemicals in M. polymorpha L. are terpenoids and flavonoids, among which especially the flavonoids show significant human health benefits. Many researches on the gametophyte of M. polymorpha L. have been reported. However, as the reproductive organ of M. polymorpha L., the bioactivity and flavonoids profile of the archegoniophore have not been reported, so in this work the flavonoid profiles, antioxidant and acetylcholinesterase inhibition activities of the extracts from the archegoniophore and gametophyte of M. polymorpha L. were compared by radical scavenging assay methods (DPPH, ABTS, O2-), reducing power assay, acetylcholinesterase inhibition assay and LC-MS analysis. The results showed that the total flavonoids content in the archegoniophore was about 10-time higher than that of the gametophyte. Differences between the archegoniophore and gametophyte of M. polymorpha L. were observed by LC-MS analysis. The archegoniophore extracts showed stronger bio-activities than those of the gametophyte. The archegoniophore extract showed a significant acetylcholinesterase inhibition, while the gametophyte extract hardly inhibited it.

Consequently, diagnosis of PKD remains largely based on the clinical phenotype. Understanding the pathophysiology of PKD may facilitate discrimination between PKD-D and PKD-C, potentially contributing to more accurate diagnosis. We conducted resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging on patients with PKD-D (n=22), PKD-C (n=10), and healthy controls (n=32). Local synchronization was measured in all 3 groups via regional homogeneity (ReHo) and evaluated using receiver operator characteristic analysis to distinguish between PKD-C and PKD-D. Cortical-basal ganglia circuitry differed significantly between the 2 groups at a specific frequency. Furthermore, the PKD-D and PKD-C patients were observed to show different spontaneous brain activity in the right precuneus, right putamen, and right angular gyrus at the slow-5 frequency band (0.01-0.027Hz). The frequency-specific abnormal local synchronization between the 2 types of PKD offers new insights into the pathophysiology of this disorder to some extent.

The molecular mechanisms underlying MMS-induced apoptosis have been studied extensively; however, little is known about the mechanism for MMS-induced necroptosis. Therefore, we first established MMS-induced necroptosis model using human lung carcinoma A549 cells. It was found that, within a 24-h period, although MMS at concentrations of 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mu M can induce DNA damage, only at higher concentrations (400 and 800 mu M) MMS treatment lead to necroptosis in A549 cells, as it could be inhibited by the specific necroptotic inhibitor necrostatin-1, but not the specific apoptotic inhibitor carbobenzoxy-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-[O-methyl]-fluoromethylketone (Z-VAD-fmk). MMS-induced necroptosis was further confirmed by the induction of the necroptosis biomarkers including the depletion of cellular NADH and ATP and leakage of LDH. This necroptotic cell death was also concurrent with the increased expression of p53, p53-induced gene 3 (PIG-3), high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1), and receptor interaction protein kinase (RIP) but not the apoptosis-associated caspase-3 and caspase-9 proteins. Elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) level was also involved in this process as the specific ROS inhibitor (4-amino-2,4-pyrrolidine-dicarboxylic acid (APDC)) can inhibit the necroptotic cell death. Interestingly, knockdown of PIG-3 expression by small interfering RNA (siRNA) treatment can inhibit the generation of ROS. Taken together, these results suggest that MMS can induce necroptosis in A549 cells, probably through the PIG-3-ROS pathway.

ALUMINUM TOXICITY; XYLEM SAP; SPECIATION; PLANTS; IDENTIFICATION; RESISTANCE; TOLERANCE; BUCKWHEAT; LEAVES	Hydroponic experiments were performed to investigate the effects of exogenous organic acids on Al accumulation and Al forms in two rape genotypes, Heza No. 7 (Al-tolerant) and Zhongnongyou No. 6 (Al-sensitive) under Al stress. Results showed there exhibited diverse effects on different varieties of rape. Citrate can significantly improve the absorption of Al in Heza No. 7. Al content in Al ? citrate increased by 50 % compared with single-Al treatment. In Zhongnongyou No. 6, the highest Al content was observed under mixed treatment with citrate and malate. Organic acids significantly promoted the absorption of Mg, Ca, K, and Fe in roots of Zhongnongyou No. 6, but there were fewer effects on elemental absorption by Heza No. 7. Al-NMR results showed that Al in rape root mainly existed in the form [AlO4Al12(OH)(24)(H2O)(12)](7+), with a chemical shift of about 63 ppm. Upon addition of exogenous organic acids, Al mainly existed as non-phytotoxic forms of Al-citrate and Al-malate complexes and showed fewer Al-F complex, Al(OH)(2)(4+), and Al(OH)(2)(4+) species. This finding can explain why rape root accumulates large amounts of Al upon treatment with exogenous organic acids but shows no serious toxicity symptoms. We thus conclude that Al-citrate and Al-malate play important roles during Al detoxification in rape.

However, it is possible that different kinds of working memory representations may distort visual perception in different ways. In the present study, we associated working memory representations with different attentional tags and then examined their effects on perceived duration. The results showed that working memory representations prolonged apparent duration when they were tagged as a target and shortened perceived duration when they were tagged as a distractor. This is the first demonstration that attentional tags can modulate working memory effects on perceptual experience. We conclude that the influences of working memory on visual perception are determined not only by what information to be held in memory, but also by how the information is represented in memory.

UGPase gene from Aureobasidium pullulans NRRL Y-12974 was cloned, overexpressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant UGPase possess molecular mass of 55 KDa and specific activity of 7.33 U/mg protein. The K (m) values of rUGPase were 5.045 mu M against UTP and 3.333 mu M against Glc-1-P. The V (max) values of rUGPase were 3.467 mu M min(-1)against UTP and 2.817 mu M min(-1) against Glc-1-P. And, it does not catalyze Glc-1-P and ATP, nor galactose-1-P and UTP. Homolgous expression of UGPase in native organism can improve the intracellular UDPG concentration by 4.7-fold time. The yield of pullulan in engineering strain A4 was improved to 18.2 g g(-1) cell dry weight which is 1.3-fold time of parent strain.

How does acute exercise affect the redox effector factor-1 (Ref1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling and its association with mitochondrial H2O2 production and antioxidant capacity? What is the main finding and its importance? Ref1/Nrf2 signalling in skeletal muscles was activated by acute exercise, and this activation was correlated with increased mitochondrial H2O2 content and antioxidant capacity (reduced glutathione and manganese superoxide dismutase). The finding indicates that the oxidative stress induced by acute exercise in skeletal muscle mitochondria is associated with the upregulation of Ref1/Nrf2 signalling and enhancement of antioxidant defense pathways. This mechanism may play a role in preventing cellular oxidative stress resistance during acute exercise. The molecular mechanism of exercise-induced oxidative stress and adaptive activation of antioxidant responses in skeletal muscle has not been fully elucidated. This study aimed to investigate the effect of acute exercise on redox effector factor-1 (Ref1) and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signalling and associations with mitochondrial H2O2 production and antioxidant mechanisms in skeletal muscles. Groups of male ICR/CD-1 mice were subjected to an acute exercise bout of different durations (45, 90, 120 or 150min). Muscle tissues (gastrocnemius and quadriceps femoris) were harvested after exercise to measure mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (CuZnSOD) activities, reduced glutathione (GSH) content and expression of Ref1/Nrf2 genes and Ref1/Nrf2 proteins. The acute exercise increased oxidative stress and activated Ref1/Nrf2 signalling in a time-dependent manner, with a linear correlation between the mitochondrial H2O2 content and Ref1/Nrf2 expressions. The GSH content and MnSOD activity were also significantly increased, but CuZnSOD activity was not significantly affected. The findings indicate that the H2O2 production induced by acute exercise in skeletal muscle mitochondria in the mouse is closely associated with upregulation of the Ref1/Nrf2 signalling pathway and enhancement of antioxidant defense components, including GSH and MnSOD. Activation of Ref1/Nrf2/antioxidant defense pathways may play a role in preventing cellular oxidative stress resistance during acute exercise.

To take full advantage of the information about targets and their surrounding background, we propose a novel single object tracking-by-detection tracker in this paper, combining semi-supervised learning, multiple instance learning and the Bayesian theorem. The tracker uses a block-based inconsistency function of the labeled and unlabeled training samples in the selection of optimal weak classifiers during the parameter updating phase of each frame. Experimental results showed that the proposed tracker has excellent performance over other eight state-of-the-art trackers for thirteen open-access video sequences.

The results showed that OCP contamination remains widespread in the area. The OCP concentrations were 2.52-27.99 ng/L in the SPM samples and 1.35-26.36 ng/L in the water column samples. Pattern analysis suggested that both fresh and weathered hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) were present. Low alpha-HCH/gamma-HCH ratios and high beta-HCH and gamma-HCH levels contributed to the total HCH concentrations in both the water column and SPM samples. High p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)/o,p'-DDT ratios and low (dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene + dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane)/DDT ratios were found, reflecting a "dicofol-type" DDT input pattern, This suggested that new DDT inputs are occurring because of dicofol still being used in the area.

In the tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), these proteins are encoded by three genes (SlEZ1, SlEZ2 and SlEZ3) that display specific expression profiles. Using a gene specific RNAi strategy, we demonstrate that repression of SlEZ2 correlates with a general reduction of H3K27me3 levels, indicating that SlEZ2 is part of an active PRC2 complex. Reduction of SlEZ2 gene expression impacts the vegetative development of tomato plants, consistent with SlEZ2 having retained at least some of the functions of the Arabidopsis CURLY LEAF (CLF) protein. Notwithstanding, we observed significant differences between transgenic SlEZ2 RNAi tomato plants and Arabidopsis clf mutants. First, we found that reduced SlEZ2 expression has dramatic effects on tomato fruit development and ripening, functions not described in Arabidopsis for the CLF protein. In addition, repression of SlEZ2 has no significant effect on the flowering time or the control of flower organ identity, in contrast to the Arabidopsis clf mutation. Taken together, our results are consistent with a diversification of the function of CLF orthologues in plants, and indicate that although partly conserved amongst plants, the function of EZ proteins need to be newly investigated for non-model plants because they might have been recruited to specific developmental processes.

Spasm in Arterial Grafts in Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Surgery	ANNALS OF THORACIC SURGERY			English	Review							INTERNAL MAMMARY ARTERY; INFERIOR EPIGASTRIC ARTERY; HUMAN RADIAL ARTERY; FACTOR-MEDIATED HYPERPOLARIZATION; ENDOTHELIUM-DEPENDENT RELAXATION; NITRIC-OXIDE RELEASE; THORACIC ARTERY; FUNCTIONAL CLASSIFICATION; NITROGLYCERIN SOLUTION; CLINICAL-IMPLICATIONS	Spasm of arterial grafts in coronary artery bypass grafting surgery is still a clinical problem, and refractory spasm can occasionally be lethal. Perioperative spasm in bypass grafts and coronary arteries has been reported in 0.43% of all coronary artery bypass grafting surgery, but this may be an underestimate. Spasm can develop not only in the internal mammary artery but more frequently in the right gastroepiploic and radial artery. The mechanism of spasm can involve many pathways, particularly those involving regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration. Endothelial dysfunction also plays a role in spasm. Depending on the clinical scenario, the possibility of spasm during and after coronary artery bypass grafting should be confirmed by angiography. If present, immediate intraluminal injection of vasodilators is often effective, although other procedures such as an intraaortic balloon pump or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also become necessary to salvage the patient. Prevention of spasm involves many considerations, and the principles are discussed in this review article.

However, the source of Wnt ligands and their signaling effects on the orofacial morphogenetic process remain elusive. Results: Using Foxg1-Cre to impair Wnt secretion through the inactivation of Gpr177/mWls, we investigate the relevant regulation of Wnt production and signaling in nasal-facial development. Ectodermal ablation of Gpr177 leads to severe facial deformities resulting from dramatically reduced cell proliferation and increased cell death due to a combined loss of WNT, FGF and BMP signaling in the developing facial prominence. In the invaginating nasal pit, the Gpr177 disruption also causes a detrimental effect on migration of the olfactory epithelial cells into the mesenchymal region. The blockage of Wnt secretion apparently impairs the olfactory epithelial cells through modulation of JNK signaling. Conclusions:Our study thus suggests the head ectoderm, including the facial ectoderm and the neuroectoderm, as the source of canonical as well as noncanonical Wnt ligands during early development of the nasal-facial prominence. Both -catenin-dependent and -independent signaling pathways are required for proper development of these morphogenetic processes. Developmental Dynamics 245:414-426, 2016.

As a result, the expression of nitric oxide decreases and endothelial dysfunction occurs. Studies have evaluated the association between the serum ADMA level and risk of coronary artery disease. However, conflicting results have been obtained. Methods Pubmed, Web of Science, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane databases were searched to identify eligible studies published in English until December 2014. Association was assessed on the basis of weighted mean differences (WMD) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Publication bias was analysed using Begg's and Egger's tests. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate result stability. Results A total of 16 case-control studies with 2939 patients and 1774 controls were included in the meta-analysis. Pooled result indicated that patients with coronary artery disease yielded a higher ADMA level than healthy controls (WMD: 0.248, 95% CI: 0.156-0.340; p=1.16 e-7). Sensitivity analysis suggested that our meta-analysis result was stable. Subgroup analysis found a similar pattern in patients with myocardial infarction (WMD: 0.397, 95% CI: 0.112-0.683; p=0.0106), stable angina pectoris (WMD: 0.197, 95% CI: 0.031-0.364; p=0.02) and unstable angina pectoris (WMD: 0.857, 95% CI: 0.293-1.420; p=0.003). Conclusions Meta-analysis results indicated that an increased ADMA level is associated with an increased risk of coronary artery disease.

Cheating was assessed through a temptation resistance paradigm in which participants were instructed not to cheat in a guessing game. Across three studies (total N = 361), preschool-aged participants were randomly assigned to either a reputation condition, in which an experimenter told them that she had learned of their positive reputation from classmates, or to a control condition in which they received no such information. By age 5, children in the reputation condition cheated less often than those in the control condition even though nobody was watching and choosing not to cheat conflicted with their personal interest. These findings are the first to show that informing children that they have a positive reputation to maintain can influence their moral behavior.

A transcriptome-wide study on the microRNA- and the Argonaute 1-enriched small RNA-mediated regulatory networks involved in plant leaf senescence	PLANT BIOLOGY			English	Article						Argonaute 1; leaf senescence; microRNA; protein interaction; senescence associated gene; small RNA	SENESCING ARABIDOPSIS LEAVES; ABSCISIC-ACID; RESOURCE; GENES; RICE; IDENTIFICATION; DATABASE; SERVER; ATNAP; ROOT	Leaf senescence is an important physiological process during the plant life cycle. However, systemic studies on the impact of microRNAs (miRNAs) on the expression of senescence-associated genes (SAGs) are lacking. Besides, whether other Argonaute 1 (AGO1)-enriched small RNAs (sRNAs) play regulatory roles in leaf senescence remains unclear. In this study, a total of 5,123 and 1,399 AGO1-enriched sRNAs, excluding miRNAs, were identified in Arabidopsis thaliana and rice (Oryza sativa), respectively. After retrieving SAGs from the Leaf Senescence Database, all of the AGO1-enriched sRNAs and the miRBase-registered miRNAs of these two plants were included for target identification. Supported by degradome signatures, 200 regulatory pairs involving 120 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and 40 SAGs, and 266 regulatory pairs involving 64 miRNAs and 42 SAGs were discovered in Arabidopsis. Moreover, 13 genes predicted to interact with some of the above-identified target genes at protein level were validated as regulated by 17 AGO1-enriched sRNAs and ten miRNAs in Arabidopsis. In rice, only one SAG was targeted by three AGO1-enriched sRNAs, and one SAG was targeted by miR395. However, five AGO1-enriched sRNAs were conserved between Arabidopsis and rice. Target genes conserved between the two plants were identified for three of the above five sRNAs, pointing to the conserved roles of these regulatory pairs in leaf senescence or other developmental procedures. Novel targets were discovered for three of the five AGO1-enriched sRNAs in rice, indicating species-specific functions of these sRNA-target pairs. These results could advance our understanding of the sRNA-involved molecular processes modulating leaf senescence.

Nitrogen removal performance and granule characteristics were tracked by continuous-flow monitoring to evaluate the long-term joint effects of Cu and Zn and of Cu and oxytetracycline (OTC). Cu and Zn with a joint loading rate (JLR) of 0.04 kg m(-3) day(-1) did not affect the performance, while a JLR of 0.12 kgm(-3) day(-1) caused a rapid collapse in performance. Cu and OTC addition with a JLR of 0.04 kg m(-3) day(-1) for approximately 2 weeks induced significant nitrite accumulation. Granule characteristic analysis elucidated the disparate inhibition mechanisms of heavy metals and antibiotics: the internalization of heavy metals caused metabolic disorders, whereas OTC functioned as a growth retarder. However, anammox reactors could adapt to a JLR of 0.04 kg m(-3) day(-1) via self-regulation during the acclimatization to subinhibitory concentrations, which had a stable nitrogen removal rate (>8.5 kg m(-3) day(-1)) and removal rate efficiency (>75 %) for reactors with Cu-OTC addition. Therefore, this study supports the great potential of using anammox granules to treat swine wastewater.

The feasibility of using the anammox process for treating wastewater that contains fluoride was examined in this study. The short-term inhibitory effect was tested at various fluoride concentrations and exposure times, and diverse pre-exposure strategies were performed in special serum bottles. Subsequently, the long-term effect of fluoride stress was continuously monitored and evaluated in an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. RESULTS: The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of fluoride for anammox biomass was calculated to be 767 mg L-1 in batch tests with an initial total nitrogen (TN) level of 200 mg L-1. A remarkable inhibitory effect of fluoride emerged when the substrate was supplied at >420 mg L-1 TN. The diameter and settling velocity of the granules significantly increased with the addition of 250 mg L-1 fluoride. CONCLUSION: The performance of the anammox system and the granule properties were abnormal at a fluoride concentration of 400 mg L-1. The anammox UASB reactor was able to treat wastewater containing up to 350 mg L-1 fluoride after 183 days.

Reciprocal Inhibitory Interactions Between the Reward-Related Effects of Leptin and Cocaine	NEUROPSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY			English	Article							VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING-FACTOR; CONDITIONED PLACE PREFERENCE; DOPAMINE NEURONS; DRUG-ADDICTION; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; INTRAVENTRICULAR INSULIN; SECONDARY REINFORCEMENT; MAINTENANCE TREATMENT; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS	Cocaine is habit-forming because of its ability to enhance dopaminergic neurotransmission in the forebrain. In addition to neuronal inputs, forebrain dopamine circuits are modulated by hormonal influences; one of these is leptin, an adipose-derived hormone that attenuates the rewarding effects of food-and hunger-associated brain stimulation reward. Here we report reciprocal inhibition between the rewardrelated effects of leptin and the reward-related effects of cocaine in rats. First, we report that cocaine and the expectancy of cocaine each depresses plasma leptin levels. Second, we report that exogenous leptin, given systemically or directly into the ventral tegmental area, attenuates the ability of cocaine to elevate dopamine levels in the nucleus accumbens, the ability of cocaine to establish a conditioned place preference, and the ability of cocaine-predictive stimuli to prolong responding in extinction of cocaine-seeking. Thus, whereas leptin represents an endogenous antagonist of the habit-forming and habit-sustaining effects of cocaine, this antagonism is attenuated by cocaine and comes to be attenuated by the expectancy of cocaine.

Since the flavonoids also act as important signals mediating the establishment of symbiosis between rhizobium and leguminous plants, the Sinorhizobium meliloti 1021 was tested to find out whether it had any impact on soybean's tolerance to salt stress. The roots of soybean seedling (Glycine max cultivar Union85140) were inoculated by soak in diluted S. meliloti 1021 suspension and then the seedlings were transferred in sphagnum peat and pearlite soil. Five days after inoculation, the seedlings were treated with salt solutions every four days until harvest. Soybean seedlings inoculated with S. meliloti 1021 demonstrated significantly stronger lodging-resistance and the fresh weight of the whole plants increased by 10.95-30.95 % compared with that of the non-inoculated plants. These changes in soybean seedlings might be resulted from: 1. S. meliloti 1021 playing a role in helping soybean plant to exclude Na+ while absorb K+, reducing ionic stress caused by salts; 2. S. meliloti 1021 enhancing the antioxidant enzymes' activities on reducing oxidative stress caused by salts; 3. S. meliloti 1021 increasing the content of osmotic compounds, thus reducing osmotic stress caused by salts. In addition, S. meliloti 1021 played significant roles in regulating the transcription of several key enzymes related to flavonoids metabolism (cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, chalcone synthase and chalcone isomerase), ROS scavenging (catalases, ascorbate peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase and superoxide dismutase), and other salt-responsive genes (Stress-induced protein SAM22, PR10-like protein and Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C) in soybean seedlings. These results showed that S. meliloti 1021 significantly enhanced soybean's ability to adapt to saline soil, mostly due to its effect on flavonoids metabolism in plants.

To investigate the influence of starvation on the sludge characteristics and reactivation performance of the anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process, the starvation process of high-activity anammox granules over 50 days and the subsequent reactivation characterization of the granules were evaluated in two upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactors at 20 degrees C and 4 degrees C, respectively. The results showed that the starvation temperature had a significant impact on the morphological and physical properties. Anammox granules stored at 4 degrees C achieved a relatively low decay rate, excellent nitrogen removal capacity, and a low protein-to polysaccharide (PN/PS) ratio after reactivation. Those results demonstrated that 4 degrees C was more suitable for the maintenance of structural integrity and granule stability during long-term starvation. The nitrogen removal performance of anammox granules after starvation could be recovered after 4 days of operation, and the anammox activity could be fully restored within 8 days. Furthermore, anammox granules preserved at 4 degrees C obtained a better recovery performance than those at 20 degrees C. In summary, anammox granules could be stored up to 50 days without running the risk of losing the integrity of the granules and metabolic potentials. And anammox performance after prolonged starvation could be fully revived. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

With wide deployment of cameras in urban transportation systems, the surveillance video becomes an important data source to conduct vehicle counting. However, the efficiency and accuracy of vehicle counting are seriously affected by the complexity of traffic scenarios. In this paper, we employ the virtual loop method to improve the quality of video-based vehicle counting method. As details, the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is fused with the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) for improving the segmentation quality of moving vehicles. In addition, a restoration method is designed to remove noise and fill holes for obtaining a better object region. Finally, a morphological feature and the color-histogram are utilized to solve occlusion issues. The effectiveness and efficiency experiments show that the proposed approach can improve the vehicle segmentation result and the vehicle occlusion detection. The accuracy of vehicle counting can also be improved significantly and reach 98%. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By extending ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption (CP-ABE) with a hierarchical structure of multiple authorities, the scheme not only achieves scalability due to its hierarchical structure, but also inherits fine-grained access control on the transmitted messages. Also by exploiting attribute-based signature (ABS), the scheme can authorize the vehicles that can most appropriately deal with the message efficiently. The results of efficiency analysis and comparison with the related works show that the proposed scheme is efficient and scalable in dealing with access control and message authentication for data dissemination in VANET.

The first SC dome is centered around x-0.3 and then disappears as P content increases to x-0.5. For x > 0.5, a second SC dome appears, and T-c reaches another maximum at x=0.7. Although the maximum of T-c in the two domes is close to each other, the estimated upper critical field (H-c2) is much larger in the first SC dome, implying a difference in the nature between the two SC domes. Further band calculations and thermopower measurements suggest that there could be a Lifshitz transition in the electronic structure between the two SC domes. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

The insertion of a thin layer MoO3 has a significant impact on the interfacial energy level alignment of pentacene-C-60 heterostructure. For the deposition of C-60 on pentacene, the energy difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital of donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of acceptor (HOMOD-LUMOA) offset of C-60/pentacene heterostructure increased from 0.86 eV to 1.54 eV after the insertion of a thin layer MoO3 on ITO. In the inverted heterostructrure where pentacene was deposited on C-60, the HOMOD-LUMOA offset of pentacene/C-60 heterostructure increased from 1.32 to 2.20 eV after MoO3 modification on ITO. The significant difference of HOMOD-LUMOA offset shows the feasibility to optimize organic electronic device performance through interfacial engineering approaches, such as the insertion of a thin layer high work function MoO3 films.

Genome-wide association study using family-based cohorts identifies the WLS and CCDC170/ESR1 loci as associated with bone mineral density	BMC GENOMICS			English	Article						Osteoporosis; BMD; GWAS; Polygenic; SNP; Pleiotropic	CALCIUM INTAKE; GENETIC DETERMINATION; PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY; METAANALYSIS; OSTEOPOROSIS; MASS; DETERMINANTS; FRACTURE; REVEALS; WOMEN	Background: Osteoporosis is a common and debilitating bone disease that is characterised by a low bone mineral density (BMD), a highly heritable trait. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have proven to be very successful in identifying common genetic variants associated with BMD adjusted for age, gender and weight, however a large portion of the genetic variance for this trait remains unexplained. There is evidence to suggest significant genetic correlation between body size traits and BMD. It has also recently been suggested that unintended bias can be introduced as a result of adjusting a phenotype for a correlated trait. We performed a GWAS meta-analysis in two populations (total n = 6,696) using BMD data adjusted for only age and gender, in an attempt to identify genetic variants associated with BMD including those that may have potential pleiotropic effects on BMD and body size traits. Results: We observed a single variant, rs2566752, associated with spine BMD at the genome-wide significance level in the meta-analysis (P = 3.36 x 10(-09)). Logistic regression analysis also revealed an association between rs2566752 and fracture rate in one of our study cohorts (P = 0.017, n = 5,654). This is an intronic variant located in the wntless Wnt ligand secretion mediator (WLS) gene (1p31.3), a known BMD locus which encodes an integral component of the Wnt ligand secretion pathway. Bioinformatics analyses of variants in moderate LD with rs2566752 produced strong evidence for a regulatory role for the variants rs72670452, rs17130567 and rs1430738. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis suggested that the variants rs12568456 and rs17130567 are associated with expression of the WLS gene in whole blood, cerebellum and temporal cortex brain tissue (P = 0.034-1.19 x 10(-23)). Gene-wide association testing using the VErsatile Gene-based Association Study 2 (VEGAS2) software revealed associations between the coiled-coil domain containing 170 (CCDC170) gene, located adjacent to the oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene, and BMD at the spine, femoral neck and total hip sites (P = 1.0 x 10(-06), 2.0 x 10(-06) and 2.0 x 10(-06) respectively). Conclusions: Genetic variation at the WLS and CCDC170/ESR1 loci were found to be significantly associated with BMD adjusted for only age and gender at the genome-wide level in this meta-analysis.

Here we showed that the transient increase of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) after prolonged FS promoted adult seizure susceptibility, which was blocked by interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) within a critical time window. Postnatal administered IL-1 beta alone mimicked the effect of FS on adult seizure susceptibility. IL-1R1 knockout mice were not susceptible to adult seizure after prolonged FS or IL-1 beta treatment. Prolonged FS or early-life IL-1 beta treatment increased the expression of cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1R) for over 50 days, which was blocked by IL-1Ra or was absent in IL-1R1 knockout mice. CB1R antagonist, knockdown and endocannabinoid synthesis inhibitor abolished FS or IL-1 beta-enhanced seizure susceptibility. Thus, this work identifies a pathogenic role of postnatal IL-1 beta/IL-1R1 pathway and subsequent prolonged prominent increase of endocannabinoid signaling in adult seizure susceptibility following prolonged FS, and highlights IL-1R1 as a potential therapeutic target for preventing the development of epilepsy after infantile FS.

However, little is known about its functions and cellular distribution in Taxus x media, which is a hybrid Taxus species containing a high content of taxol. In this study, LC-MS/MS was used to identify peptides enriched by immune-purification with high-efficiency succinyl-lysine antibody. A total of 193 succinylated proteins and 325 succinylation sites were identified. The bioinformatics analysis indicated that these succinylated proteins were involved in a wide range of cellular functions from metabolism to protein binding and showed diverse subcellular localizations. Furthermore, our findings suggested that lysine succinylation in Taxus x media involved a diverse array of metabolic processes and protein-protein interactions. Many enzymes involved in multiple metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism, the tricarboxylic acid cycle and carbon fixation, were identified as substrates for lysine succinylation, suggesting the presence of a common mechanism underlying the participation of succinylation in metabolic regulation. These results provide the first comprehensive view of the succinylome of Taxus x media and may catalyze future biological investigation of succinylation.

Agents compete to publish and become cited by occupying the nodes of a citation network calibrated by real-world citation datasets. Our Monte-Carlo simulations reveal that differences in individual performance are strongly related to PE, whereas HFTC alone cannot provide sustainable academic careers under intensely competitive conditions. Remarkably, the negative effect of high competition levels on productivity can be buffered by elevated research efficiency if simultaneously HFTC is sufficiently low. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Geometric-phase-based quantum computing has drawn much attention recently, which offers advantages against inaccuracies and local fluctuations. In addition, multiqubit gates are particularly appealing and play important roles in QIP. We here present a simple and efficient scheme for realizing a multi-target-qubit unconventional geometric phase gate in a multi-cavity system. This multiqubit phase gate has a common control qubit but different target qubits distributed in different cavities, which can be achieved using a single-step operation. The gate operation time is independent of the number of qubits and only two levels for each qubit are needed. This multiqubit gate is generic, e.g., by performing single-qubit operations, it can be converted into two types of significant multi-target-qubit phase gates useful in QIP. The proposal is quite general, which can be used to accomplish the same task for a general type of qubits such as atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, and superconducting qubits.

J	Li, BW; Dierckx, H				Li, Bing-Wei; Dierckx, Hans			Spiral wave chimeras in locally coupled oscillator systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							CHEMICAL OSCILLATORS; STATES; SYNCHRONIZATION; POPULATIONS; NETWORKS; QUORUM	The recently discovered chimera state involves the coexistence of synchronized and desynchronized states for a group of identical oscillators. In this work, we show the existence of (inwardly) rotating spiral wave chimeras in the three-component reaction-diffusion systems where each element is locally coupled by diffusion. A transition from spiral waves with the smooth core to spiral wave chimeras is found as we change the local dynamics of the system or as we gradually increase the diffusion coefficient of the activator. Our findings on the spiral wave chimera in the reaction-diffusion systems suggest that spiral chimera states may be found in chemical and biological systems that can be modeled by a large population of oscillators indirectly coupled via a diffusive environment.

The electronic heat capacity data show an obvious anomaly at the transition temperature, which indicates bulk superconductivity. The specific-heat jump is Delta C/(gamma T-n(c))approximate to 1.35, suggesting a weak coupling scenario. By measuring the low-temperature thermal conductivity, we conclude that Ta3Pd3Te14 is very likely a dirty s-wave superconductor. The emergence of superconductivity in Ta3Pd3Te14 with a lower T-c, compared to that of Ta4Pd3Te16, may be attributed to the lower density of states.

The precursor with pH >= 7 is suitable for in situ formation of the diphase structure consisting of BST and MB. Accordingly, MB particles homogeneously disperse in BST particles, accompanied by the formation of boron-rich grain boundary resulting from liquid phases sintering of B2O3. Related with the existence of boron-rich grain boundary and the incorporation of Mg2+ into BST lattice, permittivity decreases rapidly with increasing volume fraction of MB from 0.0 to 0.2 and then decreases slowly with further increasing, which coincides with theoretical prediction of the layered model.

In this study, two new JAZ genes named SmJAZ3 and SmJAZ9 were cloned from S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots and characterized. Expression profiles under methyl jasmonate (MJ) treatment revealed that SmJAZ3 and SmJAZ9 were both MJ-responsive. Subcellular localization assay showed that SmJAZ3 was located in nucleus while SmJAZ9 was preferentially in nucleus. Expression of SmJAZ3 and SmJAZ9 in S. miltiorrhiza hairy roots differently affected the production of tanshinone. Over-expression of SmJAZ3 or SmJAZ9 in hairy roots produced lower level of tanshinone compared with the control, tanshinone production was as low as 0.077 mg/g DW in line SmJAZ3-3 and 0.266 mg/g DW in line SmJAZ9-22. Whereas, down-regulation of SmJAZs enhanced tanshione production, the content of tanshinone increased to 2.48 fold in anti-SmJAZ3-3 line, and 1.35-fold in anti-SmJAZ9-23 line. Our work indicated that SmJAZ3 and SmJAZ9 are involved in regulation of tanshinone biosynthesis and act as repressive transcriptional regulators in the JA signaling pathway, which paves the way to further dissect molecular mechanism in details in the future.

Then the topological properties of the network and its minimal spanning tree are calculated to weigh the influence and importance of a country in all exporters, and the time evolution of the properties. It turns out that the properties fluctuate with the time. Consequently, the correlations of the arms exporters are discussed with the recipients during and after the wars. Besides, a time delayed network is constructed. The correlations of the exporters with time lag are discussed by filtering the time delayed network in different ways. The interactions between the exporters are visualized after filtering. This study may shed new light on how arms exports reflect foreign policies. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

K substitution for Ba introduces hole-type carriers, while Mn substitution for Cu provides local spins. Different from previous reported DMSs, this material crystallizes into orthorhombic BaCu2S2-type crystal structure.

J	Kuang, L; Tang, X; Yu, MQ; Huang, YJ; Guo, KH				Kuang, Li; Tang, Xiang; Yu, MeiQi; Huang, Yujian; Guo, Kehua			A comprehensive ranking model for tweets big data in online social network	EURASIP JOURNAL ON WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS AND NETWORKING			English	Article						Online social network; Micro-blogging; Collaborative ranking; Data analysis; Cyber physical system		Online social network (OSN) is an important part of cyber physical system (CPS). In OSN, micro-blogging has grown rapidly to a popular online social network recently and provides a large number of real-time tweets for users. With the popularity of micro-blogging and the increase of active users, many users are faced with an information overload problem, especially for those with many followees and thousands of tweets arriving every day. In this paper, we aim to investigate the problem of recommending valuable tweets that users are really interested in personally, so as to reduce their efforts to find useful information. We consider three major aspects in our proposed ranking model, including the popularity of a tweet itself, the intimacy between the user and the tweet publisher, and the interest fields of the user. The detailed indicators for each aspect are introduced by analyzing users' behaviors and their meanings on micro-blogs. The experimental results show that the proposed model can help improve the ranking performance in precision and greatly outperform several baseline methods.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of the branching fraction for psi(3770) -> gamma chi c0	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article							CROSS-SECTIONS; MONTE-CARLO; MASS	By analyzing a data set of 2.92 fb(-1) of e(+) e(-) collision data taken at root s = 3.773 GeVand 106.41 x 10(6) psi(3686) decays taken at root s = 3.686 GeVwith the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we measure the branching fraction and the partial decay width for psi(3770)->gamma chi c0 to be B(psi(3770)->gamma chi c0) = (6.88 +/- 0.28 +/- 0.67) x 10(-3) and Gamma[psi(3770)->gamma chi c0] = (187 +/- 8 +/- 19) keV, respectively. These are the most precise measurements to date. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier B.V.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of the e(+)e(-) -> pi(+) pi(-) cross section between 600 and 900 MeV using initial state radiation	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						Hadronic cross section; Muon anomaly; Initial state radiation; Pion form factor; BESIII	HADRONIC CONTRIBUTIONS; SIGMA(E(+)E(-); PI(+)PI(-)); G-2	We extract the e(+) e(-) -> pi(+) pi(-) cross section in the energy range between 600 and 900 MeV, exploiting the method of initial state radiation. A data set with an integrated luminosity of 2.93 fb(-1) taken at a center-of-mass energy of 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider is used. The cross section is measured with a systematic uncertainty of 0.9%. We extract the pion form factor vertical bar F pi vertical bar(2) as well as the contribution of the measured cross section to the leading-order hadronic vacuum polarization contribution to (g - 2)(mu). We find this value to be a(mu)(pi pi,LO) (600-900 MeV) = (368.2 +/- 2.5(stat)+/- 3.3(sys)).10(-10), which is between the corresponding values using the BaBar or KLOE data. (C) 2015 The Authors.

In this work, a red fluorescent silole, 2,5-bis[5-(dimesitylboranyl)thiophen-2-yl]-1-methyl-1,3,4-triphenylsilole ((MesB)(2)DTTPS), is synthesized and characterized. (MesB)(2)DTTPS exhibits enhanced fluorescence efficiency in nanoaggregates, indicative of aggregation-enhanced emission (AEE). The organic dots fabricated by encapsulating (MesB)(2)DTTPS within lipid-PEG show red fluorescence peaking at 598 nm and a high fluorescence quantum yield of 32%. Upon excitation at 820 nm, the dots show a large two-photon absorption cross section of 3.43 x 10(5) GM, which yields a two-photon action cross section of 1.09 x 10(5) GM. These (MesB)(2)DTTPS dots show good biocompatibility and are successfully applied to one-photon and two-photon fluorescence imaging of MCF-7 cells and two-photon in vivo visualization of the blood vascular of mouse muscle in a high-contrast and noninvasive manner. Moreover, the 3D blood vasculature located at the mouse ear skin with a depth of over 100 m can also be visualized clearly, providing the spatiotemporal information about the whole blood vascular network.

These siRNAs are highly enriched within the annealed regions of the NAT (natural antisense transcript) pairs. To date, great research efforts have been taken for systematical identification of the NATs in various organisms. However, developing a freely available and easy-to-use program for NAT prediction is strongly demanded by researchers. Here, we proposed an integrative pipeline named NATpipe for systematical discovery of NATs from de novo assembled transcriptomes. By utilizing sRNA sequencing data, the pipeline also allowed users to search for phase-distributed nat-siRNAs within the perfectly annealed regions of the NAT pairs. Additionally, more reliable nat-siRNA loci could be identified based on degradome sequencing data. A case study on the non-model plant Dendrobium officinale was performed to illustrate the utility of NATpipe. Finally, we hope that NATpipe would be a useful tool for NAT prediction, nat-siRNA discovery, and related functional studies. NATpipe is available at www.bioinfolab.cn/NATpipe/NATpipe.zip.

Our strategy forms simultaneous double nanophases in the PVDF matrix, that is, homogeneously dispersed CB nanoparticles and organic PVDF-g-IL nanodomains. The organic nanodomains were produced by microphase separation of the PVDF-g-M chains from the PVDF matrix at melt state in the electron beam (EB) irradiated PVDF/IL-CB nanocomposites. Furthermore, the CB nanoparticles were fully adhered with these nanodomains, and novel structures with nanodomains@CB nanoparticle were achieved. Such nanodomains@CB nanoparticle structures showed a synergetic nucleating effect on the PVDF crystallization and led to the formation of dominant nonpolar alpha phases in the nano-PVDF/IL-CB composites. Because of the nanodomains adhesion of the CB nanoparticles, the nano-PVDF/IL-CB composites displayed a drastic reduction in dc conductivity compared with that of PVDF/ CB and PVDF/IL-CB composites, respectively. Importantly, the resultant nano-PVDF/IL-CB composites exhibited significantly decreased losses relative to that of PVDF/CB, PVDF/IL, and PVDF/IL-CB composites. The structures of nanodomains@CB-nanoparticle can be well responsible for this improvement of dielectric performance due to the fact that nanodomains confined the ion movements of IL in electric field and that their adhesion to the CB nanoparticle surfaces largely hindered the direct CB CB nanoparticle contacts, thus decreasing their leakage currents. Our strategy not only fabricates PVDF/CB dielectric materials with good CB dispersion, higher dielectric permittivity, lower conductivity, and lOwer loss but also paves a new strategy for fabricating nanocomposites with double nanophases in polymer matrix.

MOORE; PURIFICATION; ROOT; MANDARINORUM; DELIVERY; GROWTH; BUNGEI; ASSAY	High-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was successfully used for the separation of abietane-type diterpenoids from the medicinal plant C. kaichianum, which were not separated in our previous study using preparative HPLC. The HSCCC separation employed the lower phases of n-hexane-ethyl acetate-methanol-water (HEMW) 4:5:4:5 and HEMW 4:5:5:4 as the mobile phase for stepwise elution while the upper phase of HEMW 4:5:4:5 was used as the stationary phase. HSCCC separation yielded 90.5mg of compound 1(kaichianone A), 137.7mg of compound 2 (kaichianone B), 125.0mg of compound 3 (teuvincenone E), and 227.6mg of compound 4 (taxusabietane A) with purities of 95.3%, 97.2%, 97.8%, and 98.6%, respectively, as determined by HPLC. Compounds 1-2 are two new abietane-type diterpenoids while Compounds 3-4 are known abietane-type diterpenoids, analyzed by ESIMS and NMR data. The results demonstrated that HSCCC can be an excellent alternative for other separation methods. The two new compounds showed significant cytotoxicity against ileocecal carcinoma HCT-8 and breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells.

We hypothesized that the resources from one (donor) microsite could be translocated within a clonal network, released into different (recipient) microsites and subsequently used by neighbor plants in the recipient microsite. To test these hypotheses, we conducted two experiments in which connected and disconnected ramet pairs of Potentilla anserina were grown under both homogeneous and heterogeneous water regimes, with seedlings of Artemisia ordosica as neighbors. The isotopes [N-15] and deuterium were used to trace the translocation of nitrogen and water, respectively, within the clonal network. The water and nitrogen taken up by P anserina ramets in the donor microsite were translocated into the connected ramets in the recipient microsites. Most notably, portions of the translocated water and nitrogen were released into the recipient microsite and were used by the neighboring A. ordosica, which increased growth of the neighboring A. ordosica significantly. Therefore, our hypotheses were supported, and plant clonal integration mediated the horizontal hydraulic redistribution of resources, thus benefiting neighboring plants. Such a plant clonal integration-mediated resource redistribution in horizontal space may have substantial effects on the interspecific relations and composition of the community and consequently on ecosystem processes.

Measurements of Absolute Hadronic Branching Fractions of the Lambda(+)(c) Baryon	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							DECAY	We report the first measurement of absolute hadronic branching fractions of Lambda(+)(c) baryon at the Lambda(+)(c)(Lambda) over bar (-)(c) production threshold, in the 30 years since the Lambda(+)(c) discovery. In total, 12 Cabibbo-favored Lambda(+)(c) hadronic decay modes are analyzed with a double-tag technique, based on a sample of 567 pb(-1) of e(+)e(-) collisions at root s = 4.599 GeV recorded with the BESIII detector. A global least-squares fitter is utilized to improve the measured precision. Among the measurements for twelve Lambda(+)(c) decay modes, the branching fraction for Lambda(+)(c) -> pK(-)pi(+) is determined to be (5.84 +/- 0.27 +/- 0.23)%, where the first uncertainty is statistical and the second is systematic. In addition, the measurements of the branching fractions of the other 11 Cabibbo-favored hadronic decay modes are significantly improved.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J.

Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) are the main focus in new vaccine development against NTHi, as the H. influenzae type b (Hib) vaccine does not cover noncapsulated NTHi. The OMPs P6 and protein D are the most promising candidate antigens for an NTHi vaccine, and low antibody levels against them in serum may be correlated with infection caused by NTHi. In the current study, we measured the antibody titers against P6, protein D, and their T-and B-cell combined peptide epitopes in healthy individuals of different ages. We found that children <1 month old had the lowest antibody levels against NTHi P6, protein D, and their T-and B-cell combined antigenic epitopes. Antibody titers increased at ages 1 to 6 months, peaked at 7 months to 3 years, and remained high at 4 to 6 years. The antibody titers started to decrease after 6 years and were the lowest in the 21- to 30-year group. The geometric mean titers (GMTs) of T-and B-cell combined antigenic epitopes in P6 and protein D were positively correlated with those of the protein antigens. Among 12 peptides tested, P6-61, P6-123, and protein D-167 epitopes were better recognized than others in human serum. These findings might contribute to the development of an effective serotype-independent vaccine for H. influenzae.

A close investigation into the recurrent descriptions of her countenance helps the reader discover Gissing's intention. The novel aims to reveal the cultivation of Thyrza's mind and the change of her life through a structural line formed by the recurrence of her countenance. Interwoven with another structural line of Egremont's activity, this structural line examines the modern mechanical way of life dominated by instrumental rationality. Furthermore, it demonstrates, from a cultural perspective, that the cultivation of the mind shall be a primary concern in one's life and provides an ideal vision of life.

In rodents, SIRT6 deficiency leads to aging-associated degeneration of mesodermal tissues. It remains unknown whether human SIRT6 has a direct role in maintaining the homeostasis of mesodermal tissues. To this end, we generated SIRT6 knockout human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) by targeted gene editing. SIRT6-deficient hMSCs exhibited accelerated functional decay, a feature distinct from typical premature cellular senescence. Rather than compromised chromosomal stability, SIRT6-null hMSCs were predominately characterized by dysregulated redox metabolism and increased sensitivity to the oxidative stress. In addition, we found SIRT6 in a protein complex with both nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) and RNA polymerase II, which was required for the transactivation of NRF2-regulated antioxidant genes, including heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1). Overexpression of HO-1 in SIRT6-null hMSCs rescued premature cellular attrition. Our study uncovers a novel function of SIRT6 in maintaining hMSC homeostasis by serving as a NRF2 coactivator, which represents a new layer of regulation of oxidative stress-associated stem cell decay.

Under external mechanical force stimuli, CDMPA showed a red-shift of 20 nm in its fluorescence emission and the mechanically induced luminescence color could return to the original state via heating or solvent vapor treatment. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence lifetime experiments indicated that the piezochromic luminescence could be attributed to the transformation from the crystalline to the amorphous phase. Additionally, the fluorescence color changed from blue to yellow with a red-shift of 33 nm using the stimulus of protonation. The emission color was recovered upon fuming with dimethyl formamide (DMF) vapor. Infrared (IR) spectra of CDMPA powder and theoretical calculation of the frontier molecular orbitals showed that protonation of the amino moieties in CDMPA had a significant effect on the frontier molecular orbitals and, thus, caused the acidchromism phenomenon. This study provides comprehensive insight into the stimuli-responsive luminescent mechanisms within this type of compound and the reversible switching of emission color may enable discovery of novel applications of CDMPA for detection and sensing devices.

GSH is synthesized by sulfur (S) assimilation pathway. Many studies have tried to investigate the role of GSH homeostasis on Cd tolerance using mutants; however, most of them have focused on the last few steps of S assimilation. Until now, mutant evidence that explored the relationship between GSH homeostasis on Cd tolerance and S absorption is rare. To further reveal the role of GSH homeostasis on Cd stress, the wild-type and a sultr1;1-sultr1;2 double mutant which had a defect in two distinct high-affinity sulfate transporters were used in this study. Growth parameters, biochemical or zymological indexes and S assimilation-related genes' expression were compared between the mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis plants. It was found that the mutations of SULTR1;1 and SULTR1;2 did not affect Cd accumulation. Compared to the wild-type, the double mutant was more sensitive to Cd under limited sulfate supply and suffered from stronger oxidative damage. More importantly, under the same condition, lower capacity of S assimilation resulted in decreased GSH content in mutant. Faced to the limited GSH accumulation, mutant seedlings consumed a large majority of GSH in pool for the synthesis of phytochelatins rather than participating in the antioxidative defense. Therefore, homeostasis of GSH, imbalance between antioxidative defense and severe oxidative damage led to hypersensitivity of double mutant to Cd under limited sulfate supply.

Here we demonstrate that mice deficient for REG gamma, a proteasome activator, show significantly attenuated intestinal inflammation and colitis-associated cancer in dextran sodium sulfate model. Bone marrow transplantation experiments suggest that REG gamma's function in non-haematopoietic cells primarily contributes to the phenotype. Elevated expression of REG gamma exacerbates local inflammation and promotes a reciprocal regulatory loop with NF kappa B involving ubiquitin-independent degradation of I kappa B epsilon. Additional deletion of I kappa B epsilon restored colitis phenotypes and inflammatory gene expression in REG gamma-deficient mice. In sum, this study identifies REG gamma-mediated control of I kappa B epsilon as a molecular mechanism that contributes to NF kappa B activation and promotes bowel inflammation and associated tumour formation in response to chronic injury.

In this paper, we systematically explore the efficiency-enhancing mechanism of ABX(3) (A = CH3NH3; B = Sn, Pb; X = Cl, Br, I) and provide the best absorber among ABX(3) when the organic framework A is CH3NH3 by first-principles calculations. The results reveal that the valence band maximum (VBM) of the ABX(3) is mainly composed of anion X p states and that conduction band minimum (CBM) of the ABX(3) is primarily composed of cation B p states. The bandgap of the ABX(3) decreases and the absorptive capacities of different wavelengths of light expand when reducing the size of the organic framework A, changing the B atom from Pb to Sn, and changing the X atom from Cl to Br to I. Finally, based on our calculations, it is discovered that CH3NH3SnI3 has the best optical properties and its light-adsorption range is the widest among all the ABX(3) compounds when A is CH3NH3. All these results indicate that the electronegativity difference between X and B plays a fundamental role in changing the energy gap and optical properties among ABX(3) compounds when A remains the same and that CH3NH3SnI3 is a promising perovskite absorber in the high efficiency solar batteries among all the CH3NH3BX3 compounds.

Since one TAS transcript is cleaved into multiple ta-siRNAs in a phased manner, TAS genes may be engineered to express multiple artificial ta-siRNAs (ata-siRNAs) that target multiple viruses at several distinct genomic positions. To test this hypothesis, the Arabidopsis TAS3a gene was engineered to express ata-siRNAs targeting the genome of Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants expressing these ata-siRNAs showed high level of resistance to both viruses. These results suggest that plant TAS genes can be modified to express artificial ta-siRNAs to confer multiple virus resistance and could have broad applications for future development in virus resistance strategies.

By providing participants with feedbacks regarding their memory concealment performance during the CIT, we investigated the feedback-related neural activity underlying memory concealment. Participants acquired crime-relevant memories via enacting a lab crime, and were tested with the feedback-CIT while EEGs were recorded. We found that probes (e.g., crime-relevant memories) elicited larger recognition-P300s than irrelevants among guilty participants. Moreover, feedback-related negativity (FRN) and feedback-P300 could also discriminate probes from irrelevants among guilty participants. Both recognition- and feedback-ERPs were highly effective in distinguishing between guilty and innocent participants (recognition-P300: AUC = .73; FRN: AUC=.95; feedback-P300: AUC = .97). This study sheds new light on brain-based memory detection, such that feedback-related neural signals can be employed to detect concealed memories. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In 2012, Chen et al. showed that the scheme of Sood et al. does not achieve mutual authentication and is vulnerable to off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They also found that another scheme proposed by Song is vulnerable to similar off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks. They further proposed an improved scheme. In this paper, we first show that the improved scheme of Chen et al. still suffers from off-line password guessing and smart card stolen attacks, does not support perfect forward secrecy, and lacks the fairness of session key establishment. We then propose a new security-enhanced scheme and show its security and authentication using the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus.

The main objective of the present study was to determine the KSHV seroprevalence and its risk factors among male STI patients. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in three prefectures of Anhui province, China, between June and September 2013. A total of 1,600 male patients who visited an STI clinic were invited, and 1,372 participated in the study. Data were abstracted from the medical records for all the patients. Blood samples were collected and tested for antibodies to KSHV, HIV, HCV, and syphilis. Factors associated with KSHV seropositivity were examined using multivariable logistic regression analysis. The overall prevalence of KSHV, HIV, HCV, and syphilis was 13.3%, 0.7%, 0.6%, and 12.5%, respectively. After adjusting for potential confounders, KSHV infection was significantly associated with ever having anal sex with men (19 out of 30 males, OR: 8.64, 95%Cl: 1.92-38.79) and HIV infection (six out of nine HIV-positive individuals, OR: 8.39, 95%Cl: 1.80-39.04). There were no significant associations of KSHV infection with drug use, heterosexual sex behaviors, syphilis, and HCV. Our finding has shown that a relatively moderate prevalence of KSHV was found among male STI patients. While an increased risk for KSHV infection was observed among participants with homosexual contacts. Routine KSHV testing is recommended for male individuals attending STI clinics.

For both areas, research yielding solid information on taxonomy, phylogeny, and breeding of this genus are essential. Traditional morphological and cytological characterization are used in combination with molecular results in classification and identification. Markers may be useful when used alone but are not always reliable in identification. The number of species studied and identified by molecular markers is small at present. Conventional breeding methods are time-consuming and laborious. In the past two decades, promising advances have been made in taxonomy, phylogeny and breeding of Dendrobium species due to the intensive use of molecular markers.

J	Chen, GF; Sheu, JS				Chen, Gen-Fang; Sheu, Jia-Shing			Synchronous transmission of a Gong-Che notation musical score and its MIDI information	COMPUTERS & ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						Gong-Che notation; Digitizing; Watermarking algorithm; Synchronous transmission; Image processing; Optical music recognition	COMPONENT; RECOGNITION	We present a watermarking algorithm to synchronously transmit Gong-Che notation musical scores and their musical instrument digital interface (MIDI) information. Our algorithm transforms the MIDI information into a binary sequence, which is used to form watermarking data. This watermark is embedded into the Gong-Che notation musical score image, using an inward clockwise rotation. The algorithm then uses optical music recognition to judge whether the musical information in the image is loss. Experiments have validated the effectiveness of our watermarking and expansion algorithms. The expansion process increases transmission accuracy, and the added processing time is minimal. Furthermore, our methodology can be applied to other musical notations such as conventional musical notation or numbered musical notation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Direct and indirect trophic effects of predator depletion on basal trophic levels	ECOLOGY			English	Article						direct trophic effects; human impacts; indirect trophic effects; fiddler crabs meiofauna; predator depletion	NITROGEN-CYCLE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SALT MARSHES; ECOSYSTEM; COASTAL; COLLAPSE; IMPACTS; RESILIENCE; LANDSCAPES; HERBIVORY	Human population growth and development have heavily degraded coastal ecosystems with cascading impacts across multiple trophic levels. Understanding both the direct and indirect trophic effects of human activities is important for coastal conservation. In New England, recreational overfishing has triggered a regional trophic cascade. Predator depletion releases the herbivorous purple marsh crab from consumer control and leads to overgrazing of marsh cordgrass and salt marsh die-off. The direct and indirect trophic effects of predator depletion on basal trophic levels, however, are not understood. Using observational and experimental data, we examined the hypotheses that (1) direct trophic effects of predator depletion decrease meiofaunal abundance by releasing deposit feeding fiddler crabs from consumer control, and/or (2) indirect trophic effects of predator depletion increase meiofaunal abundance by releasing blue carbon via the erosion of centuries of accreted marsh peat. Experimental deposit feeder removal led to 23% higher meiofaunal density at die-off than at healthy sites, while reciprocally transplanting sediment from die-off and healthy sites revealed that carbon-rich die-off sediment increased meiofauna density by over 164%: six times stronger than direct trophic effects. Recovering sites had both carbon-rich sediment and reduced deposit feeding leading to higher meiofauna densities than both die-off and healthy sites. This suggests that consequences of the trophic downgrading of coastal habitats can be driven by both direct and indirect trophic mechanisms that may vary in direction and magnitude, making their elucidation dependent on experimental manipulations.

Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) belongs to the genus Alphacoronavirus, resulting in a lethal systemic granulomatous disease called feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), which is one of the most important fatal infectious diseases of cats worldwide. No specific vaccines or drugs have been approved to treat FIP. CoV main proteases (M(pro)s) play a pivotal role in viral transcription and replication, making them an ideal target for drug development. Here, we report the crystal structure of FIPVMpro in complex with dual inhibitors, a zinc ion and a Michael acceptor. The complex structure elaborates a unique mechanism of two distinct inhibitors synergizing to inactivate the protease, providing a structural basis to design novel antivirals and suggesting the potential to take advantage of zinc as an adjunct therapy against CoV-associated diseases.

J	Huang, ZR; Ohara, N; Davis, H; Pokorny, J; Northoff, G				Huang, Zirui; Ohara, Natsuho; Davis, Henry (Hap); Pokorny, Johanna; Northoff, Georg			The temporal structure of resting-state brain activity in the medial prefrontal cortex predicts self-consciousness	NEUROPSYCHOLOGIA			English	Article						Resting-state fMRI; Self-consciousness; Cortical midline structures; Scale-free brain dynamics	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; FMRI; SCALE; OSCILLATIONS; DYNAMICS; FLUCTUATIONS; TIME; METAANALYSIS; REFLECTION	Recent studies have demonstrated an overlap between the neural substrate of resting-state activity and self-related processing in the cortical midline structures (CMS). However, the neural and psychological mechanisms mediating this so-called "rest-self overlap" remain unclear. To investigate the neural mechanisms, we estimated the temporal structure of spontaneous/resting-state activity, e.g. its long-range temporal correlations or self-affinity across time as indexed by the power-law exponent (PLE). The PLE was obtained in resting-state activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) in 47 healthy subjects by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We performed correlation analyses of the PLE and Revised Self-Consciousness Scale (SCSR) scores, which enabled us to access different dimensions of self-consciousness and specified rest-self overlap in a psychological regard. The PLE in the MPFC's resting-state activity correlated with private self-consciousness scores from the SCSR. Conversely, we found no correlation between the PLE and the other subscales of the SCSR (public, social) or between other resting-state measures, including functional connectivity, and the SCSR subscales. This is the first evidence for the association between the scale-free dynamics of resting-state activity in the CMS and the private dimension of self-consciousness. This finding implies the relationship of especially the private dimension of self with the temporal structure of resting-state activity. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The convergence rate and error estimate of the algorithm are established. Its proven that the asymptotically optimal approximation can be achieved by solving two small systems on the coarse mesh and two similar linear problems (same stiffness matrix only with different right-hand side) on the fine mesh. Compared with the fine space, the coarse space can be extremely coarse both in theory and in numerical applications. Crown Copyright (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The chemical and physical stabilities as well as antibrowning effects in apple juice were also evaluated. The formulation of artocarpanone microemulsion consisted of 4% w/w of ethyl butyrate, 10.67% w/w of Tween 80, 5.33% w/w of polyethylene glycol 400, and 80% w/w of water, with a maximum solubility of artocarpanone up to 10.54 0.01 mg/mL, at least 3000-folds increase in solubility compared that in water. Encapsulating artocarpanone and ascorbic acid (V-C) into microemulsion simultaneously decreased modest artocarpanone solubility whereas improving its stability in long-term storage. Blank, artocarpanone and artocarpanone-Vc-loaded microemulsions demonstrated steadily during accelerated and long-term storage. Artocarpanone-Vc-loaded microemulsion showed strong antibrowning effects in apple juice at room temperature in 24 h, suggesting that artocarpanone-Vc-loaded microemulsion is a good antibrowning agent for apple juices.

The optimized molar ratio of Pb: Ce was 200 mol: 4 mol for the X-GRL and TOC removals. The results showed a high current efficiency for effective X-GRL treatment. Under the optimal condition of current density 50 mA/cm(2), Na2SO4 0.2 mol/L, initial quality concentration of X-GRL 100 mg/L, after 2h degradation, the X-GRL and TOC removals reached 93.45% and 48.23%, respectively. Based on the degradation intermediates identification, a simplified degradation pathway of cationic red X-GRL was proposed. Based on the analysis of scanning environmental microscopy ( SEM), the surface of electrode had a dense structure and the preferred crystalline orientation, which was helpful to improve the catalytic activity of electrode and finally enhance the mineralization of X-GRL.

BESIII Collaboration	Measurement of Azimuthal Asymmetries in Inclusive Charged Dipion Production in e(+) e(-) Annihilations at root s=3.65 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							ODD PARTON DISTRIBUTIONS; FRAGMENTATION	We present a measurement of the azimuthal asymmetries of two charged pions in the inclusive process e(+) e(-) -> pi pi X based on a data set of 62 pb(-1) at the center-of-mass energy of 3.65 GeV collected with the SESIII detector. These asymmetries can be attributed to the Collins fragmentation function. We observe a nonzero asymmetry, which increases with increasing pion momentum. As our energy scale is close to that of the existing semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering experimental data, the measured asymmetries are important inputs for the global analysis of extracting the quark transversity distribution inside the nucleon and are valuable to explore the energy evolution of the spin-dependent fragmentation function.

The sequence of miRNVL5 precursor is 104 nt long, with a well developed secondary structure. GhCHR contains two DC1 and three PHD Cys/Hisrich domains, suggesting that GhCHR encodes a zinc-finger domain-containing transcription factor. miRNVL5 and GhCHR express at various developmental stages of cotton. Under salt stress (50-400 mM NaCl), miRNVL5 expression was repressed, with concomitant high expression of GhCHR in cotton seedlings. Ectopic expression of GhCHR in Arabidopsis conferred salt stress tolerance by reducing Na+ accumulation in plants and improving primary root growth and biomass. Interestingly, Arabidopsis constitutively expressing miRNVL5 showed hypersensitivity to salt stress. A GhCHR orthorlous gene At2g44380 from Arabidopsis that can be cleaved by miRNVL5 was identified by degradome sequencing, but no confidential miRNVL5 homologs in Arabidopsis have been identified. Microarray analysis of miRNVL5 transgenic Arabidopsis showed six downstream genes (CBF1, CBF2, CBF3, ERF4, AT3G22920, and AT3G49200), which were induced by salt stress in wild-type but repressed in miRNVL5-expressing Arabidopsis. These results indicate that miRNVL5 is involved in regulation of plant response to salt stress.

The presence of molybdenum significantly increased the rate of reduction of tungsten trioxide to tungsten dioxide using hydrogen gas as the reducing agent, and it also prevented the dioxide product from being further reduced to zerovalent metal tungsten. This molybdenum doping strategy provides a new solution for the synthesis of WO2-based materials with well-defined nanostructures. The obtained mesoporous Mo(0.14)W(0.86)O2 material possessed a metallic conductivity (0.8 Omega cm, 300 K) and a high tap density of 3.6 g cm(-3). This material exhibits a high and reversible lithium storage capacity of 635 mAh g(-1) and is stable up to at least 70 cycles without noticeable fading.

By applying the hierarchy equation method to the Landau-Zener problem, we computationally study the survival fidelity of adiabatic states without Born, Markov, rotating-wave, or other perturbative approximations. With this treatment it also becomes possible to investigate cases with very strong system-bath coupling. Different from a previous study of infinite-time Landau-Zener processes, the fidelity of the time-evolving state as compared with instantaneous adiabatic states shows nonmonotonic dependence on the system-bath coupling and on the sweep rate of the bias. We then consider the effect of applying a counterdiabatic driving field, which is found to be useful in improving the fidelity only for sufficiently short Landau-Zener processes. Numerically exact results show that different counterdiabatic driving fields can have very different robustness against environment effects. Lastly, using a case study, we discuss the possibility of introducing a dynamical decoupling field in order to eliminate the decoherence effect of the environment and, at the same time, to retain the positive role of a counterdiabatic field. Our work indicates that finite-time Landau-Zener processes with counterdiabatic driving offer a fruitful testbed to understand controlled adiabatic processes in open systems.

Such negative tension-induced instability of scrollwaves has been observed in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction systems. Here we propose a method to restabilize scroll wave turbulence caused by negative tension in three-dimensional chemical excitable media using a circularly polarized (rotating) external field. The stabilization mechanism is analyzed in terms of phase-locking caused by the external field, which makes the effective filament tension positive. The phase-locked scrollwaves that have positive tension and higher frequency defy the turbulence and finally restore order. A linear theory for the change of filament tension caused by a generic rotating external field is presented and its predictions closely agree with numerical simulations.

HAuCl4 was incorporated into porous SiO2 nano-supports through a sol-gel process of a silica precursor in inverse miniemulsions. Raspberry-like Au/SiO2 NCPs were subsequently obtained through in situ reduction of the incorporated HAuCl4 by hydrazine at the surface of SiO2 nano-supports. Most of Au nanoparticles (NPs) were half-embedded in the SiO2 nanosupports and were covered by a thin layer of porous SiO2, offering a good morphological stability to the Au/SiO2 NCPs. The content of Au NPs of the Au/SiO2 NCPs could be adjusted by the loading of HAuCl4. The influences of the HAuCl4 loading on the particle size and particle morphology of the Au/SiO2 NCPs, the pore properties of the SiO2 nano-supports, as well as the properties of the Au NPs were systematically investigated. The formation mechanism of the raspberry-like Au/SiO2 NCPs was discussed. All the synthesized Au/SiO2 NCPs displayed a high catalytic activity towards the reduction of p-nitrophenol.

In the current study, we further examined the role of PSPC1 in another DNA-damaging agent, methyl methanesulfonate (MMS)-induced DDR, in particular, focusing on MMS-induced apoptosis in HeLa cells. First, it was found that MMS treatment induced the expression of PSPC1. While MMS treatment alone can induce apoptosis, depletion of PSPC1 expression using siRNA significantly increased the level of apoptosis following MMS exposure. In contrast, overexpressing PSPC1 decreased the number of apoptotic cells. Interestingly, morphological observation revealed that many of the MMS-treated PSPC1-knockdown cells contained two or more nuclei, indicating the occurrence of mitotic catastrophe. Cell cycle analysis further showed that depletion of PSPC1 caused more cells entering the G2/M phase, a prerequisite of mitosis catastrophe. On the other hand, over-expressing PSPC1 led to more cells accumulating in the G1/S phase. Taken together, these observations suggest an important role for PSPC1 in MMS-induced DDR, and in particular, depletion of PSPC1 can enhance MMS-induced apoptosis through mitotic catastrophe.

J	Northoff, G				Northoff, Georg			Spatiotemporal psychopathology I: No rest for the brain's resting state activity in depression? Spatiotemporal psychopathology of depressive symptoms	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Article						Major depressive disorder; Resting state; fMRI	STREAM-OF-CONSCIOUSNESS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MAJOR DEPRESSION; DEFAULT-MODE; PHASE SYNCHRONIZATION; NETWORK CONNECTIVITY; TREATMENT RESPONSE; NEURAL ACTIVITY; DISORDER; SELF	Despite intense neurobiological investigation in psychiatric disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), the basic disturbance that underlies the psychopathological symptoms of MDD remains, nevertheless, unclear. Neuroimaging has focused mainly on the brain's extrinsic activity, specifically task-evoked or stimulus-induced activity, as related to the various sensorimotor, affective, cognitive, and social functions. Recently, the focus has shifted to the brain's intrinsic activity, otherwise known as its resting state activity. While various abnormalities have been observed during this activity, their meaning and significance for depression, along with its various psychopathological symptoms, are yet to be defined. Based on findings in healthy brain resting state activity and its particular spatial and temporal structure - defined in a functional and physiological sense rather than anatomical and structural - I claim that the various depressive symptoms are spatiotemporal disturbances of the resting state activity and its spatiotemporal structure. This is supported by recent findings that link ruminations and increased self-focus in depression to abnormal spatial organization of resting state activity. Analogously, affective and cognitive symptoms like anhedonia, suicidal ideation, and thought disorder can be traced to an increased focus on the past, increased past-focus as basic temporal disturbance of the resting state. Based on these findings, I conclude that the various depressive symptoms must be conceived as spatiotemporal disturbances of the brain's resting state's activity and its spatiotemporal structure. Importantly, this entails a new form of psychopathology, "Spatiotemporal Psychopathology" that directly links the brain and psyche, therefore having major diagnostic and therapeutic implications for clinical practice.

J	Northoff, G				Northoff, Georg			Spatiotemporal Psychopathology II: How does a psychopathology of the brain's resting state look like? Spatiotemporal approach and the history of psychopathology	JOURNAL OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS			English	Review						Spatiotemporal Psychopathology; Descriptive psychopathology; Structural psychopathology; Phenomenological psychopathology; Research Domain Classification (RDoC)	CORTICAL GABA NEURONS; SELF; DEPRESSION; CONSCIOUSNESS; PHENOMENOLOGY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PHILOSOPHY; COGNITION; FOCUS	Psychopathology as the investigation and classification of experience, behavior and symptoms in psychiatric patients is an old discipline that ranges back to the end of the 19th century. Since then different approaches to psychopathology have been suggested. Recent investigations showing abnormalities in the brain on different levels raise the question how the gap between brain and psyche, between neural abnormalities and alteration in experience and behavior can be bridged. Historical approaches like descriptive (Jaspers) and structural (Minkoswki) psychopathology as well as the more current phenomenological psychopathology (Paarnas, Fuchs, Sass, Stanghellini) remain on the side of the psyche giving detailed description of the phenomenal level of experience while leaving open the link to the brain. In contrast, the recently introduced Research Domain Classification (RDoC) aims at explicitly linking brain and psyche by starting from so-called 'neuro-behavioral constructs'. How does Spatiotemporal Psychopathology, as demonstrated in the first paper on depression, stand in relation to these approaches? In a nutshell, Spatiotemporal Psychopathology aims to bridge the gap between brain and psyche. Specifically, as demonstrated in depression in the first paper, the focus is on the spatiotemporal features of the brain's intrinsic activity and how they are transformed into corresponding spatiotemporal features in experience on the phenomenal level and behavioral changes, which can well account for the symptoms in these patients. This second paper focuses on some of the theoretical background assumptions in Spatiotemporal Psychopathology by directly comparing it to descriptive, structural, and phenomenological psychopathology as well as to RDoC.

Kinetic experiments and batch activity assays were employed to determine the optimal concentration of EDTA and washing time; and the performance and physiological dynamics were tracked by continuous-flow monitoring to evaluate the long-term effects. The two-step desorption process revealed that the Cu in anammox granules was primarily introduced via adsorption (approximately, 80.5%), and the portion of Cu in the dispersible layer was predominant (accounting for 71.1%). Afterwards, the Cu internalized in the cells (approximately, 14.7%) could diffuse out of the cells and be gradually washed out of the reactor over the next 20 days. The Ca2+ addition that followed led to an accelerated nitrogen removal rate recovery slope (0.1491 kgN m(-3) d(-2)) and a normal biomass growth rate (0.054 d(-1)). The nitrogen removal rate returned to normal levels within 90 days and gradual improvements in granular characteristics were also achieved. Therefore, this study provides a new insight that externally removing the adsorbed heavy metals followed by internally repairing the metabolic system may represent an optimal restoration strategy for anammox consortium damaged by heavy metals.

Here, we report that microRNAs play an essential role in the differentiation and maturation of white matter astrocytes in mouse spinal cord tissues. In glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)/Dicer conditional mutants, the initial generation of astrocyte progenitor cells was normal in the spinal cord. However, there was a much reduced number of GFAP+ astrocytes with shorter processes in the white matter of mutant tissues. In contrast, the expression of gray matter protoplasmic astrocyte marker was not affected. Together, our studies indicated that miRNAs are required for the differentiation and morphological maturation of white matter fibrous astrocytes in the developing spinal cord.

MethodsThe proposed reaction channels have been supported by theoretical calculations and D-labeling experiments. ResultsThe gas-phase cyclization reaction originating from the N- to C-sulfonyl cation transfer has been first reported to the best of our knowledge. ConclusionsFor the substituted sulfonamides, the presence of electron-donating groups (R-2-) at the C-ring effectively facilitates the reaction channel of cyclization reaction, whereas that of electron-withdrawing groups inhibits this pathway.

Accuracy in dynamics simulations is improved significantly over the single D-1 Ansatz, especially in the weak system-bath coupling regime. The reliability of the multi-D-1 Ansatz for various coupling strengths and initial conditions is also systematically examined, with results compared closely with those of the hierarchy equations of motion and the path integral Monte Carlo approaches. In addition, a coherent-incoherent phase crossover in the nonequilibrium dynamics is studied through the multi-D-1 Ansatz. The phase diagram is obtained with a critical point s(c) = 0.4. For s(c) < s < 1, the coherent-to-incoherent crossover occurs at a certain coupling strength, while the coherent state recurs at a much larger coupling strength. For s < sc, only the coherent phase exists. (C) 2016 AIP Publishing LLC.

Observation of e(+)e(-) -> omega chi(c1,2) near root s=4.42 and 4.6 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Based on data samples collected with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring at center-of-mass energies root s > 4.4 GeV, the processes e(+)e(-) -> omega chi(c1,2) are observed for the first time. With an integrated luminosity of 1074 pb(-1) near root s = 4.42 GeV, a significant omega chi(c2) signal is found, and the cross section is measured to be (20.9 +/- 3.2 +/- 2.5) pb. With 567 pb(-1) near root s = 4.6 GeV, a clear omega chi(c2) signal is seen, and the cross section is measured to be (9.5 +/- 2.1 +/- 1.3) pb, while evidence is found for an omega chi(c2) signal. The first errors are statistical, and the second are systematic. Due to low luminosity or low cross section at other energies, no significant signals are observed. In the omega chi(c2) cross section, an enhancement is seen around root s = 4.42 GeV. Fitting the cross section with a coherent sum of the psi(4415) Breit-Wigner function and a phase-space term, the branching fraction B(psi(4415) -> omega chi(c2)) is obtained to be of the order of 10(-3).

Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were employed to characterize the structure of the fibers. In these nanofibers, the TiO2 acts as the frames, and WO3 fills the gaps. The UV-vis spectroscopy suggests that the spectral response range has been successfully extended into the visible regime. Furthermore, the resulting fabrics show enhanced performance in the photocatalytic degradation of acetaldehyde relative to neat TiO2 and neat WO3. Our results indicate that electrospinning the blend solution of block copolymer and two kinds of precursor of inorganic material is an effective strategy to fabricate composite nanofibers that can improve the photocatalytic activity of TiO2, especially for visible light.

Here, we show that HDAC1 and HDAC2 are located in both the mitochondria and the nucleus in the Xenopus laevis stage 34 tectum and are mainly restricted to the nucleus following further brain development. HDAC3 is widely present in the mitochondria, nucleus, and cytoplasm during early tectal development and is mainly distributed in the nucleus in stage 45 tectum. In contrast, HDAC8 is broadly located in the mitochondria, nucleus, and cytoplasm during tectal development. These data demonstrate that HDAC1, HDAC2, and HDAC3 are transiently localized in the mitochondria and that the subcellular distribution of class I HDACs in the Xeno pus tectum is heterogeneous. Furthermore, we observed that spherical mitochondria accumulate in the cytoplasm at earlier stages, whereas elongated mitochondria are evenly distributed in the tectum at later stages. The activity of histone acetylation (H4K12) remains low in mitochondria during tectal development. Pharmacological blockades of HDACs using a broad spectrum HDAC inhibitor of Trichostatin A (TSA) or specific class I HDAC inhibitors of MS-275 and MGCD0103 decrease the number of mitochondria in the tectum at stage 34. These findings highlight a link between the subcellular distribution of class I HDACs and mitochondrial dynamics in the developing optic tectum of Xenopus laevis.

An interesting question in this context is how to prepare entanglement among particles located in different cavities, which are important for large-scale quantum information processing. We here consider a multi-cavity system where cavities are coupled to a superconducting (SC) qubit and each cavity hosts many SC qubits. We show that all intra-cavity SC qubits plus the coupler SC qubit can be prepared in an entangled Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, by using a single operation and without the need of measurements. The GHZ state is created without exciting the cavity modes; thus greatly suppressing the decoherence caused by the cavity-photon decay and the effect of unwanted inter-cavity crosstalk on the operation. We also introduce two simple methods for entangling the intra-cavity SC qubits in a GHZ state. As an example, our numerical simulations show that it is feasible, with current circuit-QED technology, to prepare high-fidelity GHZ states, for up to nine SC qubits by using SC qubits distributed in two cavities. This proposal can in principle be used to implement a GHZ state for an arbitrary number of SC qubits distributed in multiple cavities. The proposal is quite general and can be applied to a wide range of physical systems, with the intra-cavity qubits being either atoms, NV centers, quantum dots, or various SC qubits.

J	Hu, CH; Han, LD; Yiu, SM				Hu, Changhui; Han, Lidong; Yiu, Siu Ming			Efficient and secure multi-functional searchable symmetric encryption schemes	SECURITY AND COMMUNICATION NETWORKS			English	Article						cloud computing; searchable symmetric encryption; bloom filter; multi-functional searchable symmetric encryption		There is an increasing trend for data owners to outsource their data to an untrusted cloud provider. Besides providing the storage for the data, the service provider could allow the data owner or authorized clients to search over the data. To guarantee the data secure, the owner must encrypt his or her data before sending to the cloud. However, traditional encryption does not allow searching without decrypting the data. Searchable symmetric encryption is one approach that allows users to search over the encrypted data. For data applications, various different functional search have been proposed, such as wildcard search, similarity keyword search and fuzzy keyword search. Moreover, dynamic addition and removal of files should be supported in practice. However, to our knowledge, there does not exist a searchable symmetric encryption scheme that can support many properties such as more than three functions in all the aforementioned operations. In this paper, we propose an efficient multi-functional searchable symmetric encryption scheme that can support wildcard search, similarity search (including hamming distance and edit distance), fuzzy keyword search and disjunctive keyword search simultaneously. In the new scheme, the trapdoor changes with various search requests and it enumerates all possibilities of the keyword of the trapdoor. Moreover, we use an array instead of a matrix to reduce the storage, and the scheme can be constructed efficiently in terms of both computational and space complexity. Our scheme is based on the Bloom filter, and it is secure against non-adaptive chosen keyword attack. With the dynamic technique for the inverted index, our scheme can support dynamic operation such as addition and removal of data files, which can also be secure against adaptive chosen keyword attack.

However, the evolution and function of sHSP in Aspergillus species are largely unknown. In the present work, sHSPs were identified in 31 filamentous fungi, including species from Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Magnaporthe, as well as Botrytis cinerea and Neurospora crassa. Phylogenetic analysis revealed high level of divergence of sHSPs among filamentous fungi that orthologs could be only found between very closely related species. Strikingly, duplication of shsp genes occurred in genera Penicillium and also Aspergillus nidulans was observed, which might be an important pathway of sHSPs evolution. Expression analysis of shsp genes revealed that sHSPs were involved in response of A nidulans to various conditions, including cold/heat as well as oxidative and osmotic stresses, and that the recent duplicated sHSPs in A. nidulans had highly similar function.

The profile of the effective potential exhibits a stable soliton solution below a critical temperature T <= T-x(c) for both the crossover and the first-order phase transitions, and these solutions are calculated here with appropriate boundary conditions. However, it is found that only if T <= T-d(c) is the energy of the soliton M-N less than the energy of the three free constituent quarks 3M(q). As T > T-d(c), there is an instant delocalization phase transition from hadron matter to quark matter. The phase diagram together with the location of a critical end point has been obtained in the T and mu plane. We notice that two critical temperatures always satisfy T-d(c) <= T-x(c). Finally, we present and compare the result of thermodynamic pressure at zero chemical potential with lattice data.

The recent advances in high-throughput sequencing (HTS) technique have greatly facilitated large-scale detection of the miRNAs. However, thoroughly discovery of novel miRNAs from the available HTS data sets remains a major challenge. In this study, we observed that Dicer-mediated cleavage sites for the processing of the miRNA precursors could be mapped by using degradome sequencing data in both animals and plants. In this regard, a novel tool, miRNA Digger, was developed for systematical discovery of miRNA candidates through genome-wide screening of cleavage signals based on degradome sequencing data. To test its sensitivity and reliability, miRNA Digger was applied to discover miRNAs from four organs of Arabidopsis. The results revealed that a majority of already known mature miRNAs along with their miRNA*s expressed in these four organs were successfully recovered. Notably, a total of 30 novel miRNA-miRNA* pairs that have not been registered in miRBase were discovered by miRNA Digger. After target prediction and degradome sequencing data-based validation, eleven miRNA-target interactions involving six of the novel miRNAs were identified. Taken together, miRNA Digger could be applied for sensitive detection of novel miRNAs and it could be freely downloaded from http://www.bioinfolab.cn/miRNA_Digger/index.html.

Here, we did a transcriptome-wide, organ-specific study on this valuable plant by combining RNA, small RNA (sRNA) and degradome sequencing. RNA sequencing of four organs (flower, root, leaf and stem) of Dendrobium officinale enabled us to obtain 536,558 assembled transcripts, from which 2,645, 256, 42 and 54 were identified to be highly expressed in the four organs respectively. Based on sRNA sequencing, 2,038, 2, 21 and 24 sRNAs were identified to be specifically accumulated in the four organs respectively. A total of 1,047 mature microRNA (miRNA) candidates were detected. Based on secondary structure predictions and sequencing, tens of potential miRNA precursors were identified from the assembled transcripts. Interestingly, phase-distributed sRNAs with degradome-based processing evidences were discovered on the long-stem structures of two precursors. Target identification was performed for the 1,047 miRNA candidates, resulting in the discovery of 1,257 miRNA-target pairs. Finally, some biological meaningful subnetworks involving hormone signaling, development, secondary metabolism and Argonaute 1-related regulation were established. All of the sequencing data sets are available at NCBI Sequence Read Archive (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/). Summarily, our study provides a valuable resource for the in-depth molecular and functional studies on this important Chinese orchid herb.

However, we currently know little about the molecular events that can translate the pathogenic cues into the appropriate code for antiviral defense. Our present study reports a specific role of B cell lymphoma (Bcl) 6 as a checkpoint in the initiation of the host response to cytosolic RNA viruses. Remarkably, Bcl6 specifically binds to the interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) 7 loci and restrains its transcription, thereby functioning as a negative regulator for interferon (IFN)-beta production and antiviral responses. The signal-controlled turnover of the Bcl6, most likely mediated by microRNA-127, coordinates the antiviral response and inflammatory sequelae. Accordingly, derepression of Bcl6 resulted in a phenotypic conversion of macrophages into highly potent IFN-producing cells and rendered mice more resistant to pathogenic RNA virus infection. The failure to remove the Bcl6 regulator, however, impedes the antiviral signaling and exaggerates viral pneumonia in mice. We thus reveal a novel key molecular checkpoint to orchestrate antiviral innate immunity.

Using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI), reliable and spatially distributed BEN patterns have been identified in normal brain, suggesting a potential use in clinical populations since temporal brain dynamics and entropy may be altered in disease conditions. The purpose of this study was to characterize BEN in multiple sclerosis (MS), a neurodegenerative disease that affects millions of people. Since currently there is no cure for MS, developing treatment or medication that can slow down its progression represents a high research priority, for which validating a brain marker sensitive to disease and the related functional impairments is essential. Because MS can start long time before any measurable symptoms and structural deficits, assessing the dynamic brain activity and correspondingly BEN may provide a critical way to study MS and its progression. Because BEN is new to MS, we aimed to assess BEN alterations in the relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) patients using a patient versus control design, to examine the correlation of BEN to clinical measurements, and to check the correlation of BEN to structural brain measures which have been more often used inMS studies. As compared to controls, RRMS patients showed increased BEN in motor areas, executive control area, spatial coordinating area, and memory system. Increased BEN was related to greater disease severity as measured by the expanded disability status scale (EDSS) and greater tissue damage as indicated by the mean diffusivity. Patients also showed decreased BEN in other places, which was associated with less disability or fatigue, indicating a disease-related BEN re-distribution. Our results suggest BEN as a novel and useful tool for characterizing RRMS.

Focusing on three types of micro films, this paper reveals some characteristics of China's micro films within socialist cultural production with Chinese characteristics. This model departs from a past when the government managed everything during the Planned Economy, but is also different from the models of cultural policy in the West. The micro films examined areA Murder Case Triggered by a Steamed Ben, a parody of film Wuji(ThePromise 2005), market-conspiracy micro films such asImminent and The Only Choice, and social welfare micro films likeI will give you happiness when I grow up. All of them bring forth the issue of coordination and harmonization of conflict between social-welfare and market efficiency.

The control region of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in two rice leaffolders C. medinalis and M. patnalis were sequenced and analyzed. The control regions of the two rice leaffolders are located between 12S ribosomal RNA and tRNA(Met), and exhibit conserved structural elements. We identified the poly T stretches, (TA) n block, and stem-loop structure. There are no long tandem repeats found in mtDNA control region in the two rice leaffolders studied. Nevertheless, we did not find the GA-rich block in mtDNA control regions of the two rice leaffolders. The molecular-based phylogenies support the traditional morphologically based view of relationships of Pyralidae within the Ditrysia. The addition of the C. medinalis and M. patnalis mtDNA control regions to the literature promotes the understanding of the molecular evolution of Pyralidae in Ditrysia.

Landfill cover can be used for H2S control, which is a cost-effective and sustainable technique by recycling certain suitable waste as alternative landfill cover material. The attenuation of H2S emissions by four landfill cover materials, including charcoal sludge compost (CSC), final cover soil (FCS), aged refuse (AR), and clay soil (CS), was evaluated using both laboratory and field experiments. In addition, the mechanisms of H2S removal by the four cover materials were investigated. Results showed that CSC was the most effective alternative cover material for H2S control, reducing H2S by approximately 88% (in laboratory) and 82% (in field). The H2S removal capacities of the four cover materials in both the laboratory and field were in the order of CSC > FCS > AR > CS. CSC could be an effective alternative cover material for H2S removal. Results from this research provide economical and effective alternatives for H2S control at MSW landfill sites.

Each variety was planted with 100 mg/kg Cd and/or 400 mg/kg Si for 210 days. The results showed that adding Si increased Cd tolerance in T. dolabrata, but that the mechanism was specifical. In T. dolabrata, Si did not prevent Cd translocation from roots to shoots, and it significantly enhanced Cd accumulation without inhibiting growth. Moreover, Si mobilized Cd from the rhizospheric soil by stimulating phenolic exudation from the roots, suggesting that Cd-chelation combined with Si-induced phenolics were involved in Cd detoxification.

MicroRNAs also plays important roles in numerous cellular functions like apoptosis and proliferation by post-transcriptionally regulating the production of target gene expression. Here, we studied if microRNAs are involved in the regulation of SPAK-mediated cellular differentiation and inflammation. We demonstrated that miRNA-26b can directly bind to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of SPAK mRNA, by which negatively regulates its expression in Caco2-BBE cells. The expression of SPAK is always inversely related to the production of miRNA-26b, in both well-differentiated and poor-differentiated Caco2-BBE cells and mouse jejunum villus/crypt cells. Further, miRNA-26b can reverse SPAK overexpression-mediated epithelial cell barrier dysfunction in Caco2-BBE cell, suggesting that miRNA-26b modulates the integrity of epithelial cell and expression of junction proteins (such as occludin) by regulating SPAK expression, which in turn could affect differentiation. In a pathological context, the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) increases SPAK expression in Caco2-BBE cells by decreasing miRNA-26b levels. Consis-tent with these in vitro data, miRNA-26b levels were decreased in actively inflamed colonic tissues in ulcerative colitis, where SPAK expression was up-regulated, compared with normal tissues. Taken together, these results reveal a novel mecha-nism underlying the regulation of SPAK expression by miRNA-26b during the differentiation of epithelial cells, and in inflammatory conditions, which raises miRNA-26b as promising therapeutic targets for intestinal inflammation.

However, the mechanism that leads to the downregulation of alpha-catenin in cancer progression remains unclear. The present study revealed that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-kappa B signaling activation suppressed alpha-catenin expression and motility in SW620 colorectal cancer (CRC) cells, using real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and transwell migration assays. LPS treatment reduced both the mRNA and protein expression of a-catenin and thereby enhanced cell motility. Conversely, incubating cells with an NF-kappa B inhibitor disrupted these effects. Furthermore, the ectopic expression of p65 alone mimicked the effects of LPS stimulation. In CRC tissues, the presence of enteric bacterial LPS-related neutrophil-enriched foci was correlated with a-catenin downregulation. Collectively, these findings suggest that LPS-induced NF-kappa B signaling is related to a-catenin suppression and enhanced cell motility in CRC. Therefore, NF-kappa B is a novel potential therapeutic target for CRC metastasis.

J	Ye, XQ; Liu, Y; Li, FX				Ye, Xiaoqing; Liu, Ying; Li, Feixue			Biomarkers of Oxidative Stress in the Assessment of Enantioselective Toxicity of Chiral Pesticides	CURRENT PROTEIN & PEPTIDE SCIENCE			English	Review						Chiral pesticides; enantioselectivity; oxidative stress; antioxidants	HERBICIDE DICLOFOP; AQUATIC TOXICITY; HORMONE GNRH; ENANTIOMERS; INDUCTION; DAMAGE; MALONDIALDEHYDE; ANTIOXIDANTS; DEGRADATION; SEPARATION	Background: In biological systems, the individual stereoisomers of chiral substances possess significantly different biochemical properties because the specific structure-activity relationships are required for a common site on biomolecules. In the past decade, there has been increasing concern over the enantioselective toxicity of environmental chiral pollutants, especially chiral pesticides. Different responses and activities of a pair of enantiomers of chiral pesticides were often observed. Therefore, assessment of the enantioselective toxicological properties of chiral pesticides is a prerequisite in application of single-isomer products and particularly important for environmental protection. The development of biomarkers that can predict enantioselective effects from chiral pesticides has recently been gained more and more attention. The biomarkers of oxidative stress have become a topic of significant interest for toxic assessments. Methods: In this review, we summarized current knowledge and advances in the understanding of enantiomeric oxidative processes in biological systems in response to chiral pesticides. Results: The consistent results in two types of chiral insecticides ( synthetic pyrethroids and organochlorine pesticides) showed the significant difference in cytotoxicity of enantiomers, suggesting the antioxidant enzymes are reliable biomarkers for the assessment of toxicity of chiral chemicals. Results indicate that antioxidant enzymes are sensitive and valid biomarkers to assess the oxidative damage caused by chiral herbicides. In addition, it can be inferred that the enantioselectivity of chiral herbicides on antioxidant enzymes exists in other species. Compared with insecticides and herbicides, researches about the enantioselectivity of oxidative stress caused by chiral fungicides are quite limited. Only two kinds of chiral fungicides has been used to study the enantioselectivity of oxidative stress by now. Conclusion: The current knowledge that enantioselective processes of oxidative damage occur in organisms or cells extends toxicological studies of environmental contamination by chiral chemicals. These studies indicate that oxidative biomarkers can be useful for monitoring enantioselective toxicity of chiral contaminates, while comparing enantiomer-induced responses in different species should be approached with caution because of differences in uptake, target sites, biotransformation and pharmacokinetics of the enantiomers.

Methods: ALFF and SPM8 were utilized to assess alterations in regional spontaneous brain activities in patients with RRMS in comparison with healthy controls (HCs). The beta values of altered brain regions between patients with RRMS and HCs were extracted, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was generated to calculate the sensitivities and specificities of these different brain areas for distinguishing patients with RRMS from HCs. Pearson correlation analyses were applied to assess the relationships between the beta values of altered brain regions and disease duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score. Patients and participants: A total of 18 patients with RRMS (13 females; five males) and 18 sex-, age-, and education-matched HCs (14 females; four males) were recruited for this study. Measurements and results: Compared with HCs, patients with RRMS showed higher ALFF responses in the right fusiform gyrus (Brodmann area [ BA] 37) and lower ALFF responses in the bilateral anterior cingulate cortices (BA 24 and 32), bilateral heads of the caudate nuclei, and bilateral brainstem. The ROC analysis revealed that the beta values of these abnormal brain areas showed high degrees of sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing patients with RRMS from HCs. The EDSS score showed a significant negative Pearson correlation with the beta value of the caudate head (r=-0.474, P=0.047). Conclusion: RRMS is associated with disturbances in spontaneous regional brain activity in specific areas, and these specific abnormalities may provide important information about the neural mechanisms underlying behavioral impairment in RRMS.

It appears as an alternative to the traditional sampling theory, endeavoring to reduce the required number of samples for successful signal reconstruction. In practice, compressive sensing aims to provide saving in sensing resources, transmission, and storage capacities and to facilitate signal processing in the circumstances when certain data are unavailable. To that end, compressive sensing relies on the mathematical algorithms solving the problem of data reconstruction from a greatly reduced number of measurements by exploring the properties of sparsity and incoherence. Therefore, this concept includes the optimization procedures aiming to provide the sparsest solution in a suitable representation domain. This work, therefore, offers a survey of the compressive sensing idea and prerequisites, together with the commonly used reconstruction methods. Moreover, the compressive sensing problem formulation is considered in signal processing applications assuming some of the commonly used transformation domains, namely, the Fourier transform domain, the polynomial Fourier transform domain, Hermite transform domain, and combined time-frequency domain.

Moreover, the natural fiber formation of Alzheimer's beta-amyloid peptides is crucially involved in Alzheimer's disease but the mechanism still remains obscure. Herein, the assembly of the tetrapeptide motif VFFA from Ab peptides and its derivations KFFA and FFFA into different nanostructures was investigated with combined coarse-grained (CG) and all-atom(AA) models. The primary structures of the tetra-peptides were found to be the most important factor to form special nanostructures rather than the concentration of the tetra-peptides. FFFA tends to form nanosheets, while VFFA tends to form nanospheres and KFFA tends to form nanorods from the CG simulation. The stabilities of the aggregated structures from the CG simulation were investigated and confirmed by AA simulations. In addition, FFFA and VFFA have a greater tendency to assemble into ordered nanostructures than KFFA, and VFFA prefers to form a large beta-sheet like structure from cluster analysis.

The role of FHIT, fibronectin, PTEN expression in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has not been characterized. Our study aims to investigate the expression of FHIT, fibronectin, and PTEN in human HCC and their relationship with clinicopathological features and prognosis of HCC. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was used to detect expression of FHIT, FN, and PTEN in tumor tissues from 138 HCC patients. The correlation between their expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis were analyzed. Results: FHIT, fibronectin, and PTEN proteins have different expressions between HCC and adjacent nontumor tissue (chi(2) = 5.968, 7.380, 4.962; p < 0.05), which are expressed differently in the groups of different tumor stage, grade, tumor size, tumor number, lymph node metastasis, HBV infection, and cirrhosis in the background of nontumor sections (p < 0.05). In the FHIT and fibronectin positive expression group, the cumulative survival times were shorter than those in the negative expression groups (chi(2) = 4.443, 9.867; p < 0.05), and in the PTEN positive expression group the cumulative survival times were longer than in the negative expression group (chi(2) = 4.199; p < 0.05). Conclusions: FHIT, fibronectin, and PTEN were abnormally expressed in HCC cells, which have stimulative or suppressive effects on HCC carcinogenesis and progression. FHIT and fibronectin can be used as negative makers for prognosis and PTEN as a positive one.

NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS) is a noninvasive simple test for staging fibrosis in patients with NAFLD, with an acceptable diagnostic performance and extensively validated in various populations. In clinical practice, the suboptimal diagnostic accuracy however makes it clinically valuable only in excluding severe fibrosis, or in a combination with other complimentary approaches. Nevertheless, the NFS could be used as a helpful tool to monitor disease progression and to evaluate efficacy of potential therapies for NAFLD adults. This review describes the implementation of NFS in fibrosis staging and outcome predicting. The outcome prediction of NAFLD traditionally depends on baseline histology of biopsy specimen, and advanced fibrosis is best associated with overall and liver-related mortality among the individual pathologic features. Accordingly, NFS exhibits an intriguing ability for outcome prediction, including the long term mortality, hepatic and extra hepatic complications and whether liver related or not. Its merit in predication for long-term outcomes could derive substantially from its ability in fibrosis evaluation, as a moderately prognostic accuracy was replicated by FIB-4, another good noninvasive simple test for identifying liver fibrosis, in our study and others. In addition, this ability could be explained by the incorporated variables. In more detail, lower level of albumin, older age and the concomitant injury of glucometabolism, all suggest an overall poorer outcome in complications whether liver related or not for NAFLD patients. Here we propose to calculate NFS in newly diagnosed patients with NAFLD and recalculate annually to timely monitor disease progression. Nonetheless, the appropriate cutoff values of the NFS for different purposes remain to be determined.

In this work, derivatization of the isomeric chloroanilines was carried-out to yield the corresponding N-tosyl chloroanilines, which were completely separated by gas chromatography and also possessed-clearly different electron ionization mass spectra. Thus, the three isomers could be differentiated and determined at the same time. Density functional theory calculation results indicated that the effect of the substituent pattern in electron ionization mass spectrometry is mainly due to the difference in the stability of the product ion (P2) at m/z 126, originating from the loss of tosyl radical from the precursor ion.

J	Wang, YL; Ding, Y				Wang, Yanli; Ding, Yi			The hydrogen-induced structural stability and promising electronic properties of molybdenum and tungsten dinitride nanosheets: a first-principles study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TRANSITION-METAL DICHALCOGENIDES; TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; WAVE BASIS-SET; PHASE-TRANSITION; CARRIER MOBILITY; ELASTIC STRAIN; MONOLAYER MOS2; BAND-GAP; GERMANENE; SILICENE	Utilizing first-principles calculations, we have investigated the structural stabilities and electronic properties of MoS2-like MoN2 and WN2 sheets. We find that unlike their disulfide counterparts, these dinitride sheets are dynamically unstable with strong soft modes. The soft modes of dinitride sheets can be eliminated by surface hydrogenation, and the formed MoN2H2 and WN2H2 sheets exhibit good dynamical, thermal and mechanical stabilities for both H and T-d phases. It is found that the H-phase structures present a semiconducting behaviour with band gaps of 2.43/2.50 eV for the MoN2H2/WN2H2 sheets. These band gaps can be further modulated by strain engineering, which induces an indirect-direct-indirect band gap transition in the range of -6 to 6%. On the other hand, the T-d-phase structures are zero-gap semi-metals, whose Dirac cones locate at off-symmetry reciprocal sites. Distinct from graphene, these Dirac cones are primarily composed of d-orbitals of Mo/W atoms, which are distorted with a notably anisotropic character in the MoN2H2 and WN2H2 systems. Our study demonstrates that transition-metal dinitride nanosheets can be well stabilized by hydrogenation, which brings tunable electronic properties for many potential applications in nano-electronics and nano-devices.

J	Zhu, Y; Yang, QC; You, JC; Li, YJ				Zhu, Yu; Yang, Qiucheng; You, Jichun; Li, Yongjin			Composition fluctuation intensity effect on the stability of polymer films	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							PHASE-SEPARATION; BLEND FILMS; ULTRATHIN FILMS; THIN-FILMS; MORPHOLOGY; SURFACE; NANOPARTICLES; KINETICS	The critical fluctuation intensity for the occurrence of dewetting, the basic and key problem in dewetting by means of composition fluctuation, remains obscure. In this work, therefore, the stability and fluctuation intensity of polymer films upon blending a tiny amount of a miscible component was investigated by taking poly(methyl methacrylate)/poly(styrene-ran-acrylonitrile) (i.e. PMMA/SAN) as an example. Our results indicate that both neat PMMA and neat SAN films wet the substrate of silicon oxide thermodynamically. SAN (with 1% or 2% PMMA) films dewet this substrate completely, while PMMA (with tiny amount of SAN) films are stable upon annealing at 145 degrees C. The fit and extrapolation of the RMSroughness suggest that the composition fluctuation and consequent surface undulation intensity accounts for the difference in film stability. The higher magnitude of fluctuation intensity results in the dewetting of the SAN film. On the other hand, the stronger interaction between PMMA and silicon oxide depresses the fluctuation and surface undulation along the film, which is the reason for the stable PMMA film.

A polymer monolith (poly(butyl methacrylate) (BMA)-co-ethylene dimethacrylate (EDMA)-co-2-acrylamido-2-methyl-1-propanesulfonic acid (AMPS)) was fabricated in a 50 mm microchannel by UV-initiated polymerization. The monolith not only eliminated the laminar flow induced by the nebulizer suction but also ensured variable-volume electrokinetic injection. Factors affecting the EOF rate such as the AMPS percentage and electrochromatographic conditions were optimized. The mu-EC-ICP-MS system offered satisfactory resolutions and reproducibilities (<4.4%) by individually using multiple metallic cations and iodine anions as the models. Detection limits of 0.036-0.075 mu g L-1 for mercuric and methylmercuric ions and 0.15-0.22 mg L-1 for arsenite, arsenate, monomethylarsenate and dimethylarsenate were obtained. Mercury speciation in certified fish tissue and arsenic speciation in reference human urine by using the proposed mu-EC-ICP-MS system proved its good applicability in elemental speciation.

Polymorphic variants of TLR2 are thought to be predisposing factors for various cancers. A number of studies have tried to determine whether the polymorphism of TLR influences its expression, susceptibility to CRC, but no accordant result was obtained due to the heterogeneity of the genetic background among populations. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate variants affecting CRC in a Chinese Han population. Methods: We chose 4 tg SNPs from Hap Map data on TLR2. They were genotyped on a total of 248 CRC patients and 226 healthy controls. We identified the correlation between the polymorphisms and the risk of CRC. Single nucleotide polymorphism locus was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Results: The association of rs11938228 genotype CA was significantly different (P=0.010, OR=1.933) between CRC patients and healthy controls. Furthermore, one haplotype GCAA) had a significantly higher frequency in patients (11/496=2.21%) than in controls (1/452=0.21%) (P=0.003; OR=11.387, 95% CI=1.465-88.524). Conclusions: The current study suggests that genetic variants rs11938228 in TLR2 might serve as candidate markers for susceptibility to CRC and haplotype GCAA of TLR2 gene is a risk factor for CRC patients in Chinese Han populations.

It was applied to treat X-GRL organic waste water by electric catalytic oxidation. The effect of different current density, electrolyte concentration, doping amount of La, initial concentration of X-GRL on degradation rate of simulating wastewater via the new PbO2 electrode was investigated. The results showed that the SEM experiment demonstrated the La doping amount can make particles on the surface of electrodes bright, increased the specific surface area, and improved the microstructure and the catalytic effect of electrode. Research results showed that in the process of degradation of industrial organic wastewater, electrolyte concentration and doping amount of La were the key factors of electrode degradation of X-GRL via a new type of PbO2.

Methods: LMPs were produced by human T lymphocyte leukemia cell line 6T-CEM stimulated by actinomycin D and identified by flow cytometry, and then used to induce C57/BL6 mice in various concentrations and induction times. The optimum induction conditions were determined via the detection of IL-1 beta and IL-18 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of the mice, and the inflammation response was confirmed via HE staining on the lung tissues, whereby the C57/BL6 mouse airway inflammation model was constructed. The impacts of LMPs and autophagy on the development of COPD and the corresponding mechanism were investigated through the detection of the mRNA and protein expression of TLR4, PI3K, AKT, LC-3, NLRP3, caspase-1, etc. in the lung tissues of the mice. Results: The C57/BL6 mouse airway inflammation model was successfully constructed with the optimum induction concentration of LMPs of 50 mu g/ml and the optimum induction time of 24 h. In the lung tissues of the mice, the mRNA and protein expressions of TLR4, PI3K, AKT, NLRP3 and caspase-1 were up-regulated to varying degrees except LC-3. Conclusions: NLRP3 is a key protein in LMPs-induced airway inflammation. Autophagy negatively regulates the activation of NLRP3 inflammasomes.

Epidemiological data show that obesity could increase the risk of asthma, and insulin resistance, or Metabolic syndrome are an important risk factor for obesity asthma. Some studies identified that upstream of the transcription start site within the TNF-alpha gene promoter region -308 polymorphism was associated insulin resistance or metabolic disorders, while this site was closely related to asthma. But no research was performed to evaluate the influence of TNF-alpha -308G/A polymorphism on metabolic syndrome in asthmatic patients. Methods: Here, we recruited 248 asthmatic patients, who were separated into asthma with MetS/asthma without MetS groups and 226 matched healthy controls from Zhejiang Province to evaluate the influence of TNF-alpha -308G/A polymorphism on metabolic syndrome in asthmatic patients. Single nucleotide polymorphism of TNF-alpha -308 locus was genotyped using PCR-RFLP. Some biochemical variables were also determined. Results: Our result showed that the genotypic and allelic frequency of rs1800629 did not show significant difference between asthmatic patients and normal controls. However, the frequency of A allele was significantly higher in asthma group with MetS (22.36%) than in controls (15.71%) (P = 0.02; OR = 0.647; 95% CI = 0.447-0.936). After analyzing the relationship between biochemical features of patients and genotype of TNF-alpha -308G/A, we found levels of LDL cholesterol, TNF-alpha and insulin, and HOMA-IR were significantly higher in the asthamtic patients carrying the GA and AA genotypes than in the carriers of GG genotype of rs1800629 (P = 0.029, P = 0.022, P = 0.043, respectively). Conclusion: Thus, Our data suggested that TNF-alpha -308G/A variation was related to metabolic phenotype in asthma patients. Furthermore, we first identified TNF-alpha -308 A allele was the risk factor for asthmatic patients with MetS in Zhejiang population, China.

However, polysiloxane is a polymer that suffers from poor affinity with graphene oxide, which has become a bottleneck for the integration and applications of GEO in such polymer matrixes. Here we introduce an effective approach to solve the problem by employing SiO2 as an interfacial layer. Being compatible with both GEO and silicone, the interfacial layer is nanoporous and tunable. Firstly, GEO was modified with nanoporous SiO2 via a sol-gel process. Secondly, GEO/SiO2 (GEOS) was integrated into a fluid-like hydroxyl terminated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS-OH) through a solvent-free blending process. Thirdly, the GEOS/PDMS-OH matrix was vulcanized at room temperature (RTV), forming the final silicon rubber (SR) elastomer. A tensile strength of 3.36 MPa and a Young's modulus of 3.38 MPa were achieved for the RTV SR elastomer, higher than those of GEO (0.69 and 1.40 MPa) and fumed SiO2 (1.32 and 2.2 MPa) based ones at the same filling fractions. The strong interactions between SiO2 and GEO, as well as excellent compatibility between SiO2 and PDMS-OH, make SiO2 act as a bridge for stress transmission between GEO and PDMS-OH. Simultaneously, the adjustable nanoporous architecture at the GEO/PDMS-OH interface was demonstrated to be an important contributing factor for enhanced stress transmission and mechanical properties.

In this article, the authors study location-based questions that people post on microblogs, which is a popular form of social network service. The authors collected posts with geo-tags from Sina Weibo and conducted the study based on about a thousand location-based questions. Their results reveal unique characteristics of location-based questions by analyzing what people ask, how they ask, why they ask, and the context when asking. Location-based questions are closely related to people's offline activities. Spatial restriction, subjectivity, interactivity, and propagation are the main characteristics that people value for choosing social networks to ask location-based questions. People also apply different phrasing skills to different types of questions. The questions people ask in different contexts also have different focuses. Based on their findings, the authors discuss practical design implications for social networks, location-based Q&A systems, and other applications with location-based features.

We identified differentially expressed v-yes-1 Yamaguchi sarcoma viral related oncogene homolog (lyn) gene in Xinjiang Uyghurs KS tumor tissues and normal skin tissues by Affymetrix microarray. Analyzed the influence of KSHV infection on the expression of LYN gene in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) to characterize the pathogenesis of KS and identify therapeutic targets for KS. According to the microarray and bioinformatics, LYN up-regulated in KS tissues primarily participated in response to biotic stimulus, immune response and signal transducer activity. Moreover, LYN was over-expressed in KS tissues which confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and real-time PCR. KSHV infection was detected in blood serum of 72 Xinjiang Uyghurs KS patients including the patients who provided the tissues to do microarray and 68 normal people by amplification of KS330233. The seroprevalence of KSHV was 91.7% (66/72) in KS patients and 11.8% (14/68) in normal controls of Xinjiang province (P<0.001). To explore the relationship between LYN and KSHV, we extracted KSHV from BCBL-1 cells was used to infect primary cultured HUVECs. The levels of LYN in infected HUVECs and uninfected cells were evaluated by western blot. We noted that LYN was increased and a time-effect relationship with KSHV infection. Then infected cells were treated with a LYN inhibitor, PP2. PP2 inhibited LYN expression and decreased the cell viability (P<0.01) which was evaluated by western blot and Cell Counting Kit 8, respectively. Altogether the pathogenic mechanism of KSHV in KS may involve promotion of LYN overexpression in vascular endothelial cells.

Their chiroptical properties are dependent on the position of the chiral substituent. Attachment of a chiral binaphthyl group at the periphery to form (R)/(S)-2 displays positive and negative CD curves in the 260-400 nm region, and a chiral binaphthyl linked at the boron atom to form (R)/(S)-4 exhibits a negative/positive and positive/negative sign pattern in ascending energy terms in the main absorption spectra, respectively. Very low fluorescence quantum yields and solvent-dependent fluorescent bands for 2 are observed due to the excited-state intramolecular charge transfer. In the case of 4, the fluorescence is totally quenched, which can be attributed to the complete charge localization and negligible orbital overlap of the frontier MOs. TDDFT calculations reproduce experimentally observed spectroscopic data, and provide further insight into the nature of the electronic transitions.

We assume that the share prices of the assets are governed by Markov-modulated processes; that is, the market parameters switch over the time according to a finite-state continuous time Markov chain.

Fabrication and characterisation of hydrophobic magnetite composite nanoparticles for oil/water separation	MATERIALS TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Magnetite; Composite particles; Hydrophobic; Separation; application	IRON-OXIDE NANOPARTICLES; BIOMEDICAL APPLICATIONS; FACILE SYNTHESIS; NANOCOMPOSITE; SHELL; CORE; FUNCTIONALIZATION; NANOCRYSTALS; PARTICLES; REMOVAL	The hydrophobic Fe3O4 composite nanoparticles were synthesised for oil/water separation in a simple and relatively inexpensive way. First, the Fe3O4 nanoparticles were prepared through chemical coprecipitation and then were coated SiO2 layer via sol-gel method. Subsequently, the obtained Fe3O4@SiO2 nanoparticles were modified with methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS); thus, the methacryloxypropyl group was grafted onto the surface of Fe3O4@ SiO2 through condensation reaction of hydroxyl groups of SiO2 shell and MPS molecules after hydrolysis. Fourier transformer infrared, X-ray diffraction (XRD), vibrating sample magnetometer and contact angle (CA) measurement were used to characterise the microstructure, magnetic property and surface property of Fe3O4@ SiO2-MPS nanoparticles. The measurement results revealed that Fe3O4@ SiO2-MPS nanoparticles exhibited excellent hydrophobicity with CA of water 137 +/- 3 degrees, and CA of oil nearly 0 degrees, as well as intense superparamagnetism with saturation magnetisation of 44.24 emu g(-1). The Fe3O4@SiO2-MPS nanoparticles had found application in oil/water separation by applying an external magnetic field due to their hydrophobic and magnetic property. Furthermore, the Fe3O4@SiO2-MPS nanoparticles could be recovered after washing and filtration, and the oil absorption ability only decreased slightly. These hydrophobic superparamagnetic composite nanoparticles could find application in separation and concentration areas due to their unique hydrophobicity and magnetic responsiveness.

The present study investigated the spatiotemporal expression pattern of CLMP and its regulation in the rat ovary during the periovulatory period. Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that Clmp mRNA was rapidly stimulated in intact ovaries by 4 h after human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) treatment. In situ hybridisation analysis demonstrated that Clmp mRNA expression was stimulated in theca cells at 4 h after hCG and remained elevated until 12 h. Clmp mRNA was also upregulated in granulosa cells and was present in forming corpora lutea. Our data indicate that the protein kinase A but not the protein kinase C pathway regulates the expression of Clmp mRNA in granulosa cells. Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and p38 kinase are also involved in regulating Clmp mRNA expression. The stimulation of Clmp mRNA by hCG requires new protein synthesis. Furthermore, inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor activation significantly inhibited Clmp mRNA expression, whereas inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis or progesterone action had no effect. The stimulation of CLMP in the rat ovary may be important in cell adhesion events during ovulation and luteal formation such as maintaining the structure and communication of ovarian follicular and luteal cells.

Materials and methods: A Wistar rat model of NEC was established and 30 one-day-old neonate Wistar rats were randomly divided into three groups including a normal control (group A), NEC rats treated with 0.2 ml physiological saline through intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection (group B), and NEC rats treated with 0.2 mg ITF by i.p injection (group C). Results: Compared with group B, there were statistically significant differences in Caspase-3, Bax, and Bcl-2 levels in groups A and C (P < 0.05). Moreover, there was a significant difference in the Bcl-2 level between groups A and B (P < 0.05). Conclusion: ITF alleviated injury of the intestinal tract in neonate rats with NEC and this mechanism was possibly related to a reduction in the expression of Caspase-3 and Bax and the increase in Bcl-2 expression.

J	Northoff, G				Northoff, Georg			Is the self a higher-order or fundamental function of the brain? The "basis model of self-specificity" and its encoding by the brain's spontaneous activity	COGNITIVE NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Self; Basis model; Higher-order; Cortical midline structures; Spontaneous activity; consciousness	DEFAULT NETWORK; NEURAL ACTIVITY; RESTING-STATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REWARD CIRCUITRY; MEMORY; PRIORITIZATION; MODULATION; SALIENCE; RELEVANT	What is the self? This is a question that has long been discussed in (Western) philosophy where the self is traditionally conceived a higher-order function at the apex or pinnacle of all functions. This tradition has been transferred to recent neuroscience where the self is often considered to be a higher-order cognitive function reflected in memory and other high-level judgements. However, other lines of research demonstrate a close and intimate relationship between self-specificity and more basic functions like perceptions, emotions and reward. This paper focuses on the relationship between self-specificity and other basic functions relating to emotions, reward and perception. I propose the basis model that conceives self-specificity as a fundamental feature of the brain's spontaneous activity. This is supported by recent findings showing rest-self overlap in midline regions as well as findings demonstrating that the resting state can predict subsequent degrees of self-specificity. I conclude that such self-specificity in the brain's spontaneous activity may be central in linking the self to either internal or external stimuli. This may also provide the basis for coding the self as subject in relation to internal (i.e., self-consciousness) or external (i.e., phenomenal consciousness) mental events.

Theoretical calculations have provided a lot of wealth and useful information in this research field besides experimental studies. In particular, molecular simulation has become a powerful tool in the field of biomolecules and nanoscale materials, which shed a light on the research of nanoscale dynamics of biomolecule translocation. This article reviews the recent development of molecular modelling on the biomolecules' translocation through CNTs. We discuss the effects of diameter, length, chirality of CNTs, etc. as well as the experiments results of these factors on the biomolecules' translocation processes. The mechanism and pathway of biomolecules' translocation through CNTs were summarised based on the free energy landscape.

This study enrolled a total of 49 CLM patients who underwent RFA treatment. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed using the log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard model, respectively. Univariate analysis showed that OS was closely correlated with tumor size, frequency of RFA treatment, resection of the liver lesion, and CEA levels before RFA (p < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that resection of CLM lesions after RFA, frequency of RFA treatment, and serum CEA levels before RFA were independent risk factors for the survival of CLM patients (p < 0.05). Tumor lesion size, resection of the liver lesion after RFA, frequency of RFA treatment, and serum CEA levels before RFA may be important prognostic factors of CLM patients treated with RFA therapy.

Among the differentially expressed miRNAs in breast cancer, miR-125b was revealed to be deregulated and associated with poor prognosis and chemoresistance in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), but the mechanism is still unknown. In our study, we showed downregulated expression of miR-125b in TNBC tissues and decreased migration and invasion in miR-125b-expressing Hs578T cells. MAP2K7 was then detected to be a novel target of miR-125b, and downregulation of MAP2K7 by miR-125b was similar to transient knockdown of MAP2K7 which hindered epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of Hs578T cells. Upregulation of MAP2K7 in miR-125b-overexpressing Hs578T cells partly rescued the migration and invasion suppression of miR-125b. Furthermore, MAP2K7 was overexpressed in TNBC samples compared with normal tissues and negatively correlated with miR-125b expression. In light of these findings, miR-125b emerged as a tumor suppressor in TNBC by targeting MAP2K7 to inhibit EMT.

In the present study, the cDNA of cat APRIL (cAPRIL) was successfully amplified. Sequence analysis showed that the open reading frame (ORF) of cAPRIL contains a putative furin protease cleavage site (R-R-K-R), a conserved putative N-glycosylation site (Asn(124)), and two conservative cysteine residues (Cys(196) and Cys(211)). Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis revealed that cAPRIL could be detected in various tissues. The phylogenetic analysis and predicted three dimensional (3D) structure revealed that it is similar to its counterparts. The extracellular soluble domain of the cAPRIL (csAPRIL) fragment was cloned into the expression vector pET43.1a. SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis indicated a high-level expression of csAPRIL protein in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3). MTT assays revealed that purified recombinant csAPRIL protein was able to stimulate proliferation of mouse B-cells. These findings indicate that cAPRIL plays an important role in proliferation of B-cells and provide the basis for investigation on the roles of APRIL in this important domestic species.

A total of 3,422 students (aged 11-19 years) were surveyed regarding psychological factors towards sedentary behavior. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) were performed to examine the effects of sedentary time, processes of change, self-efficacy, and decision balance regarding the sedentary behavior stage. A logistic regression analysis was used to examine the relationships between sedentary behavior and sex, grade, stages of change, and transtheoretical model (TTM) constructs. The findings indicated that high school students were significantly more sedentary on weekdays than on weekends, boys exhibited significantly less sedentary time than girls, and sedentary time was significantly greater in junior high school students than in senior high school students. Differences across the stages of change were identified in sedentary time, processes of change, decision balance, and self-efficacy. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis indicated that sex, grade, and TTM constructs, such as processes of change and decision balance, were associated with sedentary behaviors. These novel findings in Chinese high school students suggest tailored health education and practical interventions should be adopted to reduce sedentary time and thereby improve the efficacy of health promotion.

We here propose a way to achieve the coherent transfer of W-class entangled states of qubits among different cavities. Because no photon is excited in each cavity, decoherence caused by the photon decay is suppressed during the transfer. In addition, only one coupler qubit and one operational step are needed and no classical pulses are used in this proposal; thus, the engineering complexity is much reduced and the operation is greatly simplified. We further give a numerical analysis showing that high-fidelity transfer of a three-qubit W state is feasible within the present circuit QED technique. The proposal can be applied to a wide range of physical implementations with various qubits such as quantum dots, nitrogen vacancy centers, atoms, and superconducting qubits.

Herein, a "lotus-effect" tape (LET) was designed to impart solid materials with superhydrophobicity using a technique as simple as taping. The so-called LET was prepared with a Janus structure using dual-nozzle electrospinning, and consisted of a lotus-effect upper layer and a thermo-cohesive bottom layer. The LET can be pasted tightly onto the surface of various substrates via an ironing treatment with a household flatiron. The lotus-effect property was then endowed to the substrates. It is worth noting that the LET can also be detached easily from the substrate involved, but without any damage to the original surface of the substrate. This work provides a novel strategy to impart lotus-effect properties onto various materials without the limitations of special facilities and techniques.

The results showed that most of them exhibited significant inhibition on both total HAs and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b] pyridine (PhIP), one of the most abundant HAs. Among the studied flavonoids, phlorizin, epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), and quercetin were found to be the most effective in both the reductions of total HAs (55-70%) and PhIP (60-80%). The reaction activity between the flavonoid and phenylacetaldehyde, a key intermediate in PhIP formation, showed a good correlation with the inhibition of PhIP formation in an aqueous model system (R-2 = 0.8904) and a di(ethylene) glycol reaction system (R-2 = 0.6514). However, no significant correlation was found between the flavonoid antioxidant capacity and PhIP formation (R-2 = 0.2359). The postulated adducts of flavonoids-phenylacetaldehyde were further confirmed by LC-MS analysis in the chemical models. Since phenylacetaldehyde is the chief intermediate in PhIP formation, these results suggest that the inhibitory effects of flavonoids on PhIP formation are mainly dependent on their abilities to trap phenylacetaldehyde as opposed to their antioxidant capacities.

Few studies have taken into account sexual dimorphism in the context of plant functional strategies. We examine whether different sexes respond similarly to environmental heterogeneity in terms of functional clonal traits. In a greenhouse experiment, a gynodioecious clonal plant Glechoma longituba was subjected to various distributions (heterogeneous and homogeneous), but the same amount, of a nutrient supply to test whether its responses to nutrient heterogeneity differed between females and hermaphrodites. Functional clonal traits related to foraging and storing of nutrients (i.e., average spacer length and specific spacer weight) were investigated. Neither the functional clonal traits nor their responses to the environmental heterogeneity were constrained by sex. Nutrient heterogeneity significantly affected root to shoot ratio and the functional clonal traits linked to resource foraging. Our results suggest that sex-independence of functional clonal traits are related to resource foraging and storage and to their responses to environmental heterogeneity in G. longituba.

With the help of these formulae, we investigate the propagation properties of AHBs in turbulent biological tissues, the irradiance and spreading properties of AHBs in turbulent biological tissues are studied numerically. It is found that the circular and elliptical AHBs eventually become Gaussian beams in the far field and the central irradiance of the AHB rises more rapidly as the value of C-n(2) grows. We also calculate the formulae of the effective beam size of AHB and find that finally W-xz becomes equal to W-yz in turbulent biological tissues which can be used to explain the beam spot eventually becomes circular under the influence of turbulence of biological tissues.

The scattering independent term b of anomalous Hall conductivity shows obvious correlation with cubic magneto-crystalline anisotropy K-1. When nickel content x decreasing, both b and K-1 vary continuously from negative to positive, changing sign at about x = 0.85. Ab initio calculations indicate NixFe1-x has more abundant band structures than pure Ni due to the tuning of valence electrons (band fillings), resulting in the increased b and K-1. This remarkable correlation between b and K-1 can be attributed to the effect of band filling near the Fermi surface. (C) 2016 Author(s).

The spatiotemporal alterations in resting state may translate into corresponding spatiotemporal changes underlying the sensorimotor, affective, and cognitive functions, and thus, the various symptoms. Such spatiotemporal correspondence between resting state changes and psychopathological symptoms may make necessary the development of what I describe as Spatiotemporal Psychopathology'.

This study aims to unravel psychosocial mechanisms for treatment ADHD by exploring the effects of CBT on functional brain networks. Ten adults with ADHD were enrolled and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired before and after a 12-session CBT. Twelve age- and gender-matched healthy controls were also scanned. We constructed whole-brain functional connectivity networks using graph-theory approaches and further computed the changes of regional functional connectivity strength (rFCS) between pre- and post-CBT in ADHD for measuring the effects of CBT. The results showed that rFCS was increased in the fronto-parietal network and cerebellum, the brain regions that were most often affected by medication, in adults with ADHD following CBT. Furthermore, the enhanced functional coupling between bilateral superior parietal gyrus was positively correlated with the improvement of ADHD symptoms following CBT. Together, these findings provide evidence that CBT can selectively modulate the intrinsic network connectivity in the fronto-parietal network and cerebellum and suggest that the CBT may share common brain mechanism with the pharmacology in adults with ADHD.

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is associated with a high risk for developing AD. However, no study has directly examined the brain topological alterations based on combined effects of tau protein pathway genes in MCI population. Forty-three patients with MCI and 30 healthy controls underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in Chinese Han, and a tau protein pathway-based imaging approaches (7 candidate genes: 17 SNPs) were used to investigate changes in the topological organisation of brain activation associated with MCI. Impaired regional activation is related to tau protein pathway genes (5/7 candidate genes) in patients with MCI and likely in topologically convergent and divergent functional alterations patterns associated with genes, and combined effects of tau protein pathway genes disrupt the topological architecture of cortico-cerebellar loops. The associations between the loops and behaviours further suggest that tau protein pathway genes do play a significant role in non-episodic memory impairment. Tau pathway-based imaging approaches might strengthen the credibility in imaging genetic associations and generate pathway frameworks that might provide powerful new insights into the neural mechanisms that underlie MCI.

However, little is known about the central tremor network in ET patients. Twenty-six ET patients and 26 matched healthy controls (HCs) were included in this study. After considering structural and head-motion factors and establishing the accuracy of our seed region, a VIM seed-based functional connectivity (FC) analysis of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (RS-fMRI) data was performed to characterize the VIM FC network in ET patients. We found that ET patients and HCs shared a similar VIM FC network that was generally consistent with the VIM anatomical connectivity network inferred from normal nonhuman primates and healthy humans. Compared with HCs, ET patients displayed VIM-related FC changes, primarily within the VIM-motor cortex (MC)-cerebellum (CBLM) circuit, which included decreased FC in the CBLM and increased FC in the MC. Importantly, tremor severity correlated with these FC changes. These findings provide the first evidence that the pathological tremors observed in ET patients might be based on a physiologically pre-existing VIM - MC - CBLM network and that disruption of FC in this physiological network is associated with ET. Further, these findings demonstrate a potential approach for elucidating the neural network mechanisms underlying this disease. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Eugene			The H-index of a network node and its relation to degree and coreness	NATURE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article							COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; COMPLEX NETWORKS; CENTRALITY; DYNAMICS; IDENTIFICATION; ORGANIZATION; TOPOLOGIES; SEARCH	Identifying influential nodes in dynamical processes is crucial in understanding network structure and function. Degree, H-index and coreness are widely used metrics, but previously treated as unrelated. Here we show their relation by constructing an operator H, in terms of which degree, H-index and coreness are the initial, intermediate and steady states of the sequences, respectively. We obtain a family of H-indices that can be used to measure a node's importance. We also prove that the convergence to coreness can be guaranteed even under an asynchronous updating process, allowing a decentralized local method of calculating a node's coreness in large-scale evolving networks. Numerical analyses of the susceptible-infected-removed spreading dynamics on disparate real networks suggest that the H-index is a good tradeoff that in many cases can better quantify node influence than either degree or coreness.

This study aimed to investigate the role of the NE-A(1)AT system in the histological progression of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and to evaluate the ability of it to predict nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A total of 252 adults (NAFLD group, n = 202; healthy group, n = 50) were recruited. Clinical biochemical characteristics, NE and A(1)AT concentrations were measured in all subjects. Among the NAFLD group, 86 patients had previously undergone liver biopsy and information on histological characteristics was consequently available. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to determine the predictive accuracy of the NE-A(1)AT system for NASH. NAFLD patients had an elevated serum NE concentration and a reduced A(1)AT level with consequent NE/A(1)AT imbalance. NE increased in the early stage of steatosis, preceding the decline in A(1)AT, dating from the onset of NASH (NAS 3-4), and subsequently NE/A(1)AT increased in the presence of NASH. Nonetheless, this increase began to resolve as the disease state progressed to advanced fibrosis. A(1)AT had a sensitivity (SEN) of 83.8% and a specificity (SP) of 83.3% with the optimal cut-off of -1459.43, NE/A(1)AT had a SEN of 88.8% and a SP of 83.3% with cut-off of 0.363 to predict NASH. An increased NE: A(1)AT ratio is closely associated with liver Inflammation in patients with NASH and could serve as a novel marker to predict NASH in humans.

These sensors contained single hydrogen-bond functional groups, which acted as interacting sites for fluoride ion. Both sensors displayed a red color in dimethyl sulfoxide solution. Binding studies revealed that they showed noticeable calorimetric and fluorescent responses only to F- among the eight anions tested (F-, Cl-, Br-, I-, AcO-, H2PO4-, HSO4- and NO3-). H-1 NMR titration proved that the interaction between compounds and fluoride ion: hydrogen bond at low fluoride ion concentration, deprotonation at high fluoride ion concentration. Moreover, those compounds showed high sensitivity and selectivity for fluoride ion by inhibiting the excited state intramolecular proton transfer processes, and the detective processes could be followed by direct visual observation.

Considerable laparoscopic skills are required to find a suitable size at which the pressure of the sleeve is not excessive and the restriction is sufficient for obtaining good weight-loss effect without increasing the risk of complications. There is no doubt that considerable technical details are required to create a "perfect sleeve." We report our sleeve-forming technique for LSG involving both vertical gastrectomy and plication, which we have termed "laparoscopic plicated sleeve gastrectomy." This technique was shown to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of severe obesity and can reduce technical difficulties in the creation of a "perfect sleeve.".

In heart tissue, SLN is exclusively expressed in the atrium. Previously, we inserted Cre recombinase into the endogenous SLN locus by homologous recombination and succeeded in generating SLN-Cre knockin (Sln(Cre/+)) mice. This Sln(Cre/+) mouse can be used to generate an atrium-specific gene-targeting mutant, and it is based on the Cre-loxP system. In the present study, we used adult Sln(Cre/+) mice atria and analyzed the effects of heterozygous SLN deletion by Cre knockin before use as the gene targeting mouse. Both SLN mRNA and protein levels were decreased in Sln(Cre/+) mouse atria, but there were no morphological, physiological, or molecular biological abnormalities. The properties of contractility and Ca2+ handling were similar to wild-type (WT) mice, and expression levels of several stress markers and sarcoplasmic reticulum-related protein levels were not different between Sln(Cre/+) and WT mice. Moreover, there was no significant difference in sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca2+-ATPase activity between the two groups. We showed that Sln(Cre/+) mice were not significantly different from WT mice in all aspects that were examined. The present study provides basic characteristics of Sln(Cre/+) mice and possibly information on the usefulness of Sln(Cre/+) mice as an atrium-specific gene-targeting model.

Current proteomic technologies, which support reliable and high-throughput analyses, have been broadly used for exploring sophisticated molecular networks in plants. In the current study, we compared phosphoproteomic and proteomic changes in roots of different soybean seedlings of a salt-tolerant cultivar (Wenfeng07) and a salt-sensitive cultivar (Union85140) induced by salt stress. The root samples of Wenfeng07 and Union85140 at three-trifoliate stage were collected at 0 h, 0.5 h, 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h after been treated with 150 mM NaCl. LC-MS/MS based phosphoproteomic analysis of these samples identified a total of 2692 phosphoproteins and 5509 phosphorylation sites. Of these, 2344 phosphoproteins containing 3744 phosphorylation sites were quantitatively analyzed. Our results showed that 1163 phosphorylation sites were differentially phosphorylated in the two compared cultivars. Among them, 10 MYB/MYB transcription factor like proteins were identified with fluctuating phosphorylation modifications at different time points, indicating that their crucial roles in regulating flavonol accumulation might be mediated by phosphorylated modifications. In addition, the protein expression profiles of these two cultivars were compared using LC-MS/MS based shotgun proteomic analysis, and expression pattern of all the 89 differentially expressed proteins were independently confirmed by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the enzymes involved in chalcone metabolic pathway exhibited positive correlations with salt tolerance. We confirmed the functional relevance of chalcone synthase, chalcone isomerase, and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase genes using soybean composites and Arabidopsis thaliana mutants, and found that their salt tolerance were positively regulated by chalcone synthase, but was negatively regulated by chalcone isomerase and cytochrome P450 monooxygenase. A novel salt tolerance pathway involving chalcone metabolism, mostly mediated by phosphorylated MYB transcription factors, was proposed based on our findings.

CO2 and N-2 adsorption-desorption measurements and pore size analysis of N-doped reduced graphene oxide (N-rGO) and N-rGO-ZnO have been investigated and compared. What's more, the adsorption isotherms of N-rGO-ZnO material were measured at different temperatures, and it exhibited a large CO2 adsorption ability of 3.55 mmol/g at 298K and 1 atm. The impressive CO2 adsorption selectivity over N-2 has also been calculated and determined to be 35.84 by a slope method, which indicates the potential application to separate CO2 from flue gases.

Despite continuous efforts, minimizing I/R injury still represents a great challenge in standard medical treatments of ischemic heart disease, i.e., thrombolytic therapy, primary percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary arterial bypass grafting. Development of effective interventions and strategies to prevent or reduce myocardial I/R injury is therefore of great clinical significance. Endothelial dysfunction plays a significant role in myocardial I/R injury, which renders endothelial cells an attractive target for postischemic myocardial protection. The rapidly evolving knowledge of the mechanisms of endothelial I/R injury helps broaden perspective for future development of novel strategies targeting endothelium for alleviating myocardial I/R damage. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of endothelial I/R injury. Current perspectives and future directions for developing endothelium targeting therapeutics for postischemic myocardial protection are further discussed.

One cyclodepsipeptide, beauvericin, was firstly isolated from the fermentation broth of Fusarium oxysporum 5-19 endophytic on Edgeworthia chrysantha Linn. Its chemical structure was unambiguously identified by a combination of spectroscopic methods, such as HRESI-MS and H-1 and C-13 NMR. ESI-MS/MS was successfully used to elucidate the splitting decomposition route of the positive molecule ion of beauvericin. Antimicrobial results showed that this cyclodepsipeptide had inhibitory effect on three human pathogenic microbes, Candida albicans, Escherichia coli, and Staphylococcus aureus. In particular, beauvericin exhibited the strongest antimicrobial activity against S. aureus with MIC values of 3.91 mu M, which had similar effect with that of the positive control amoxicillin.

However, the underlying mechanism for serum in determining the cell fate remains to be answered. The effects of fetal bovine serum (FBS) and its major component bovine serum albumin (BSA) on EGCG-induced cell death were investigated in this study. It was found that BSA, just like FBS, can protect cells from EGCG-induced cell death in a dose-dependent manner. Detailed analysis revealed that both FBS and BSA inhibited generation of ROS to protect against toxicity of EGCG. Furthermore, EGCG was shown to bind to certain cellular proteins including caspase-3, PARP, and alpha-tubulin, but not LC3 nor beta-actin, which formed EGCG-protein complexes that were inseparable by SDS-gel. On the other hand, addition of FBS or BSA to culture medium can block the binding of EGCG to these proteins. In silico docking analysis results suggested that BSA had a stronger affinity to EGCG than the other proteins. Taken together, these data indicated that the protective effect of FBS and BSA against EGCG-induced cell death could be due to (1) the decreased generation of ROS and (2) the competitive binding of BSA to EGCG.

A 98-day microcosm incubation experiment was set up for two soils which were amended with manure biochar at proportions of 0, 0.5% and 1.5%. Swine manure samples were air-dried and manure biochar was prepared by pyrolysis at 400 C for 4 h. As determined by P-31 nuclear magnetic resonance (P-31 NMR) spectroscopy, manure biochar mainly increased the contents and fractions of orthophosphate and pyrophosphate in two soils, while decreased those of monoesters (P < 0.05). At the end of incubation, 1.5% of manure biochar raised soil pH by 0.5 and 0.6 units, cation exchange capacity by 16.9% and 32.2%, and soil total P by 82.1% and 81.1% for silt loam and clay loam soils, respectively, as compared with those soils without biochar. Simultaneously, 1.5% of manure biochar decreased acid phosphomonoesterase activities by 18.6% and 34.0% for clay loam and silt loam, respectively; while it increased alkaline phosphomonoesterase activities by 28.5% and 95.1% for clay loam and silt loam, respectively. The enhancement of soil P availability after manure biochar addition was firstly due to the orthophosphate and pyrophosphate as the major P species in manure biochar which directly increased contents of soil inorganic P, and also attributed to the decomposition of some organic P like monoesters by enhanced alkaline phosphomonoesterase activities from manure biochar addition.

In both cultures, participants displayed high levels of racial biases that remained stable between 3 and 5years of age. Unlike adults, young children's implicit racial biases were unaffected by the social status of the other-race groups. Also, unlike adults, young children displayed overt explicit racial biases, and these biases were dissociated from their implicit biases. The results provide strong evidence for the early emergence of implicit racial biases and point to the need to reduce them in early childhood.

SF(DPPB)(4) exhibits energy levels matching perfectly with those of the commonly used poly(3-hexyl thiophene) (P3HT) donor in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Furthermore, a designed cross-shaped molecular geometry helps in suppressing strong intermolecular aggregation in the P3HT:SF(DPPB)(4) blend, leading to efficient non-fullerene PSCs. The resultant devices give a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.16% with an extremely high open-circuit voltage (V-oc) of 1.14 V. In contrast, the devices based on P3HT:PC61BM blends provide a PCE of 3.18% with a V-oc of 0.62 V. Finally, we observe that the P3HT:SF(DPPB)(4) devices exhibit significantly improved thermal stability from that of the P3HT:PC61BM devices; upon thermal treatment at 150 degrees C for 3 h, the PCEs of P3HT:SF(DPPB)(4) devices remain unchanged, whereas those of the P3HT:PC61BM devices drop drastically to below 1%. The abovementioned results demonstrate that the new design strategy of employing a high-performance non-fullerene acceptor, SF(DPPB)(4), is promising for the future practical application of PSCs.

Antioxidant activity seems to play a prominent role in the treatment of sepsis exhibited by Xuebijing injection. The aim of the present research was to develop an on-line 1, 1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl-(DPPH-) capillary electrophoresis-diode array detector (on-line DPPH-CE-DAD) method for rapidly assessing antioxidant properties and efficacious material basis of antioxidant activity as a way of quality control of Xuebijing injection. Several parameters affecting the separation were investigated, including the pH and concentrations of buffer, SDS, beta-CD, and organic modifier as well as voltage and cassette temperature. Compared to previous traditional method, this improved method shortened the experimental cycle and became more efficient because it was successfully applied to analyze total antioxidant activity and contents of twelve antioxidants of Xuebijing injection under the same condition. The results revealed that the on-line DPPH-CE-DAD method was a reagent-saving, rapid, feasible, and green technique for quality control of Xuebijing injection in terms of pharmacological activity and contents of active ingredients. It also offered new opportunities for the analysis of antioxidant activity of complex matrix.

Liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate was employed in treating the rat plasma samples obtained. Separation was carried out with a Hedera (TM) ODS column (4.6 x 250 mm, 5 mu m) by gradient elution at a temperature of 40 degrees C. Excitation and emission of the fluorescence detector were set to 300 and 490 nm, respectively. The lower limits of quantification for bergapten, imperatorin, notopterol, and isoimperatorin in rat plasma were 4, 40, 4, and 2 ng mL(-1), respectively. The intraday and interday precision and accuracy for the four coumarins were within acceptable criteria. The recovery of the method was satisfactory with a range of 80.3-114%. The validated method was successfully used for the simultaneous determination of the four coumarins in Notopterygium incisum extracts and also for the pharmacokinetic and excretion study of bergapten, imperatorin, notopterol, and isoimperatorin in rats.

Two populations of Epistylis chlorelligerum Shen 1980, a colonial limnetic peritrich ciliate, were collected from different locations in China: E. chlorelligerum 1 from West Lake, Hangzhou; E. chlorelligerum 2 from East Lake, Wuhan. The morphology, infraciliature and SSU rRNA gene sequence of the two populations were investigated based on living and protargol-stained specimens. Although both populations are consistent with previous descriptions of protargol- stained specimens of this species, some differences in the morphology in vivo were observed. The two populations had identical SSU rRNA gene sequences. A second species, Epistylis chrysemydis Bishop and Jahn 1941, was also collected from East Lake, Wuhan, and was investigated for its morphology, infraciliature and SSU rRNA gene sequence. Phylogenetic analyses based on SSU rRNA gene sequence data indicate that the two populations of E. chlorelligerum are nested within the Epistylididae clade near E. wenrichi and E. urceolata. Epistylis chrysemydis is sister to the group comprising E. chlorelligerum, E. wenrichi, and E. urceolata.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Enhanced piezoelectricity and half-metallicity of fluorinated AlN nanosheets and nanoribbons: a first-principles study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; HEXAGONAL BORON-NITRIDE; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; ELECTRONIC-PROPERTIES; BAND-GAP; GRAPHENE; HYDROGEN; FUNCTIONALIZATION; FLUOROGRAPHENE; POLARIZATION	Utilizing first-principles calculations, we have investigated the structural, mechanical, piezoelectric, and electronic properties of fluorinated AlN (F-AlN) nanosheets and nanoribbons. Unlike the fluorinated graphene and BN systems, the F-AlN sheet favours a stable boat-like buckled structure, which has a soft mechanical feature with an anisotropic Young modulus and Poisson ratio. Such structural flexibility and anisotropy result in an improved piezoelectric performance for the F-AlN system, whose piezoelectric coefficients, especially d(11) and e(11), are larger than those of hexagonal group III-V, group-III monochalcogenide, and transition metal dichalcogenide nanosheets. The F-AlN sheet and its armchair nanoribbons are semiconductors, while the zigzag ones become metallic. In particular, an intriguing half-metallic behaviour appears in these zigzag F-AlN nanoribbons, whose half-metal gaps are large for room-temperature operation. Moreover, armchair F-AlN nanoribbons can also be converted to half-metals by hole doping, which brings tunable half-metal gaps to the system. Our study demonstrates that fluorination is an efficient route to tailoring the properties of AlN nanomaterials, which have promising piezoelectric performance and half-metallic characteristics for potential applications in nano-sized energy harvesting and spintronic devices.

Ca is an essential element and participates in various plant physiological responses. In the present study, the protective role of exogenous Ca in alleviating AR stress in Liquidambar formosana Hance at the physiological and proteomic levels was examined. Our results showed that low Ca condition resulted in the chlorophyll content and photosynthesis decreasing significantly in L. formosana leaves; however, these effects could be reversed by high Ca supplementation. Further proteomic analyses successfully identified 81 differentially expressed proteins in AR-treated L. formosana under different Ca levels. In particular, some of the proteins are involved in primary metabolism, photosynthesis, energy production, antioxidant defense, transcription, and translation. Moreover, quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) results indicated that low Ca significantly increased the expression level of the investigated Ca-related genes, which can be reversed by high Ca supplementation under AR stress. Further, Western blotting analysis revealed that exogenous Ca supply reduced AR damage by elevating the expression of proteins involved in the Calvin cycle, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging system. These findings allowed us to better understand how woody plants respond to AR stress at various Ca levels and the protective role of exogenous Ca against AR stress in forest tree species.

The purpose of this study was to investigate regional homogeneity (ReHo) changes in IS patients. Resting-state fMRI was performed on 11 patients with IS, along with 35 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects. Group comparisons between the two groups demonstrate that the pattern of regional synchronization synchronization in IS patients is changed. Decreased ReHo values were found in default mode network, bilateral motor-related areas and left occipital gyrus of the patient group. Increased ReHo was found in regions of cingulum, cerebellum, supplementary motor area and brain deep nucleus, such as hippocampus, caudate, thalamus and insula. The significant differences might indicate that epileptic action have some injurious effects on the motor, executive and cognitive related regions. In addition, ReHo values of left precuneus and right superior frontal gyrus were associated with the epilepsy duration in the IS group.

The survival of E. faecalis HZNU P2 in simulated gastric fluid (SGF, pH 2.0 and 2.5) and bile salt solution (1.0 and 2.0%) was assessed. In addition, the release and storage stability of E. faecalis HZNU P2 were studied. The results showed that encapsulated cells showed good tolerance to SGF and bile salt solution (1.0 or 2.0%). Encapsulated E. faecalis HZNU P2 could be completely released in simulated intestine fluid (SIF) within 1 h. The storage stability of encapsulated E. faecalis HZNU P2 was also highly improved. These results show that milk-alginate microspheres show a promise for the encapsulation, protection and release of E. faecalis HZNU P2 as a supplement and/or food ingredient. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationship between them, especially its role in consciousness, nevertheless remains unclear. Our study examined the temporal variability and signal synchronization of spontaneous brain activity, as well as their relationship during loss of consciousness. We applied an intra-subject design of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in two conditions: during wakefulness, and under anesthesia with clinical unconsciousness. In addition, an independent group of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) was included in order to test the reliability of our findings. We observed a global reduction in the temporal variability, local and distant brain signal synchronization for subjects during anesthesia. Importantly, we found a link between temporal variability and both local and distant signal synchronizations during wakefulness: the higher the degree of temporal variability, the higher its intra-regional homogeneity and inter-regional functional connectivity. In contrast, this link was broken down under anesthesia, implying a decoupling between temporal variability and signal synchronization; this decoupling was reproduced in patients with DOC. Our results suggest that there exist some as yet unclear physiological mechanisms of consciousness which "couple" the two mathematically independent measures, temporal variability and signal synchronization of spontaneous brain activity. Our findings not only extend our current knowledge of the neural correlates of anesthetic-induced unconsciousness, but have implications for both computational neural modeling and clinical practice, such as in the diagnosis of loss of consciousness in patients with DOC.

Importantly, tumor-infiltrating MDSCs have much stronger ability compared to MDSCs in the periphery. However, the mechanisms that tumor microenvironment induces the accumulation and function of MDSCs are poorly understood. Here, we report that Interleukin-33 (IL-33) - a cytokine which can be abundantly released in tumor tissues both in 4T1-bearing mice and breast cancer patients, is crucial for facilitating the expansion of MDSCs. IL-33 in tumor microenvironment reduces the apoptosis and sustains the survival of MDSCs through induction of autocrine secretion of GM-CSF, which forms a positive amplifying loop for MDSC accumulation. This is in conjunction with IL-33-driven induction of arginase-1 expression and activation of NF-kappa B and MAPK signaling in MDSCs which augments their immunosuppressive ability, and histone modifications were involved in IL-33 signaling in MDSCs. In ST2 (/) mice, the defect of IL-33 signaling in MDSCs attenuates the immunosuppressive and pro-tumoral capacity of MDSCs. Our results identify IL-33 as a critical mediator that contributes to the abnormal expansion and enhanced immunosuppressive function of MDSCs within tumor microenvironment, which can be potentially targeted to reverse MDSC-mediated tumor immune evasion.

Because soybean is self-sufficient in nitrogen, phosphorus, in the orthophosphate form (Pi), becomes the most limiting macronutrient affecting the growth and productivity of soybean, especially in acidic and alkaline soils. It has been documented that plants have developed a series of physiological and biochemical strategies to adapt to Pi deficiency, but the mechanistic details of soybean response to Pi deficiency, especially those at the molecular level, are largely unknown. In this study, we aim to understand how soybean plants respond to Pi deficiency in soils by identifying and analysing Pi-responsive genes in the roots of soybean at the whole-genome scale. The transcriptome in soybean roots under Pi-deficiency was analyzed using the Illumina's digital gene expression (DGE) high-throughput sequencing platforms, and the expression profiles of arbitrarily selected Pi-responsive genes identified in the current research were validated by quantitative RT-PCR. A total of 1612 genes were found to be differentially expressed in soybean roots after Pi deficiency for seven days; 727 genes were up-regulated, and 885 genes were down-regulated. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis showed that 17 GO terms of biological processes were significantly enriched including photosynthesis, iron ion transport, dUTP metabolism, cell wall organization, fatty acid metabolism and stress responses. Genes possibly involved in regulating Pi homeostasis, nutrient uptake and transport, homeostasis control of reactive oxygen species, calcium signaling, hormonal signaling and gene transcription were included in the differentially expressed genes. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of 30 arbitrarily selected genes and 29 of them were confirmed to exhibit similar differential expression patterns under Pi deficiency as revealed by the high throughput DGE sequencing. These results provide useful information for identifying and characterizing important components in the Pi signaling network in soybean and enhance understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which plants adapt to low Pi stress.

J	Zeng, HQ; Di, TJ; Zhu, YY; Subbarao, GV				Zeng, Houqing; Di, Tingjun; Zhu, Yiyong; Subbarao, Guntur Venkata			Transcriptional response of plasma membrane H+-ATPase genes to ammonium nutrition and its functional link to the release of biological nitrification inhibitors from sorghum roots	PLANT AND SOIL			English	Article						Plasma membrane H+-ATPase; Biological nitrification inhibition (BNI); Biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs); Ammonium; Transcriptional regulation; Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor)	PROTON PUMP ATPASE; RICE ROOTS; ADAPTATION; TRANSPORT; ALUMINUM; PHOSPHORYLATION; IDENTIFICATION; ASSIMILATION; SUPPRESSION; BINDING	Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) roots release biological nitrification inhibitors (BNIs) to suppress soil nitrification. Presence of NH4 (+) in the rhizosphere stimulates BNIs release and it is hypothesized to be functionally associated with plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase activity. However, whether the H+-ATPase is regulated at the transcriptional level, and if so, which isoforms of the H+-ATPases are involved in BNIs release are not known. Also, it is not clear whether the stimulation on BNIs release from roots is due to NH4 (+) uptake or its assimilation, which are addressed in this study. Root exudates from intact sorghum plants were collected using aerated solutions of NH4 (+) or methyl-ammonium (MeA); and the BNI-activity release was determined. PM vesicles were isolated from fresh roots using a two-phase partitioning system; and the hydrolytic H+-ATPase activity was determined. All genes encoding PM H+-ATPases were searched in sorghum genome, and their expression in response to NH4 (+) or MeA were analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR in sorghum roots. BNIs release and PM H+-ATPase activity increased with NH4 (+) concentration (a parts per thousand currency sign1.0 mM) in the root-exudate collection solutions, but at higher concentrations, it did not respond further or declined in case of the PM H+-ATPase activity. Twelve PM H+-ATPase genes were identified in sorghum genome; and these isoforms were designated SbA1 to SbA12. Five H+-ATPase genes were stimulated by NH4 (+) in the rhizosphere, and have similar expression pattern, which is consistent with the variation in H+-ATPase activity. MeA, a non-metabolizable analogue of NH4 (+), had no significant effects on BNIs release, H+-ATPase activity, or expression of the H+-ATPase genes. Our results suggest that the functional link between PM H+-ATPase activity and BNIs release is evident only at NH4 (+) levels of a parts per thousand currency sign1.0 mM in the rhizosphere. The variation in PM H+-ATPase activity by NH4 (+) is due to transcriptional regulation of five isoforms of the H+-ATPases. The stimulatory effect of NH4 (+) on BNIs release is functionally associated with NH4 (+) assimilation and not just with NH4 (+) uptake alone.

To examine the effects, we conducted an experiment with the stoloniferous herb Duchesnea indica in which we removed plant organs like roots, flowers, or fruits. Removing roots significantly increased number of ramets and biomass allocation to stolons, but decreased number of fruits. Removing flowers or fruits greatly increased number of ramets and biomass allocation to stolons and roots, but decreased spacer length, number of fruits, and fruits set. Onset and median date of flowering phenology of D.indica shifted after flowers, fruits, or roots were removed. These results may indicate that removing organs can affect trade-off between sexual and clonal reproduction of D. indica.

Although the synthesis of MSN with various morphologies and sphere size has been reported, the synthesis of MSN with monodisperse control below 200 nm by a facile, scalable and low-cost method with high tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS) concentration still remains a challenge. Herein, this goal was achieved by a templating hydrothermal technique using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as the templating surfactant and low-cost urea as mineralizing agent. The mesoporous feature and diameter of nanosphere of MSN can be efficiently adjusted. The high volume efficiency by using high TEOS concentration as Si sources and the low production cost by using urea as mineralizing agent for synthesizing MSN allow this novel technique to have great potential for industrial production. Furthermore, the advanced solid acid catalysts with superior catalytic activity and stability were prepared by supporting phosphotungstic acid (PTA) on MSN, ascribed to the high PTA dispersity and facilitated mass transfer by the short mesoporous channels in comparison with traditional mesoporous silica like MCM-41. This work presents an alternative method for overcoming low stability issue, a bottleneck problem for the industrial application of solid acid catalysts.

The introduction of 2-azulenyl moieties onto the BODIPY core results in more red-shifted absorption bands than those observed for 1-azulenyl functionalization. Upon protonation by TFA, a blue shift of the main absorption band of the 2-azulenyl-substituted compounds is observed along with a decrease in intensity, and a new weaker peak is observed at long wavelength. In contrast, the absorption of the 1-azulenyl-substituted compounds is almost unchanged upon protonation.

J	Guan, JP; Li, JY; Li, YJ				Guan, Jipeng; Li, Jingye; Li, Yongjin			Electrospun nanofibers with both surface nanopores and internal interpenetrated nanochannels for oil absorption	RSC ADVANCES			English	Article							POLYSTYRENE FIBERS; SORBENT MATERIALS; BLOCK-COPOLYMERS; FABRICATION; MORPHOLOGY; MEMBRANES; POROSITY	Polyoxymethylene (POM) nanofibers with both surface nanopores and internal interpenetrated channels have been fabricated by the electrospinning of POM/poly(L-lactide) (PLLA) blends and followed by the solvent etching of the PLLA component in the fibers. With the fast evaporation of the solvent, vapor-induced phase separation between the solvent and the POM/PLLA blends occurs on the surface of the nanofibers, which leads to numerous nanopores on the surface of the as-spun nanofibers. At the same time, POM and PLLA form a co-continuous structure in the fibers and the subsequent etching of the nanofibers by chloroform induces the removal of PLLA and the formation of the internal nanochannels in the fibers. The fabricated novel porous POM nanofibers with both surface pores and internal channels exhibit a much higher oil absorption capacity than both the neat POM nonwoven fabrics and the POM/PLLA blend nonwoven fabrics. The porous POM nonwoven fabrics from POM/PLLA (70/30) has a pump oil absorption capacity of 115.3 g g(-1), compared to 75.2 g g(-1) for the as-spun POM/PLLA blend and 53.2 g g(-1) for the neat POM nonwoven fabric. It was further found that the novel hierarchical porous structure makes the materials be an ideal alternative for both oil absorption and oil/water separation.

The mechanistic studies based on the effect of reaction parameters on stereoselectivity as well as ESI-MS analysis suggested that our ligand (Tao-Phos) and related binuclear copper centers play a crucial role in this asymmetric click chemistry because of the strong catalyst-substrate interaction with the aid of a possibly in situ formed binuclear or multinuclear copper-based transition state. This work not only provides a new example of a Cu(II)-mediated asymmetric AAC reaction involving chelating base and azides, but also suggests the significance of binuclear copper species in catalytic asymmetric click reactions with two copper center-involved enantioselective inductions.

A series of nitrated quinoline derivatives were achieved in moderate to good yields via remote C-H activation. The method overcomes some shortcomings reported in previous nitration strategies, such as employing expensive metal catalysts or using toxic and unstable nitrating agents. Furthermore, some of the products can be obtained through filtration which displays the operational simplicity of this methodology. Importantly, this protocol may provide a practical synthetic tool for the introduction of nitro groups into drug molecules.

A regression model equation was developed and validated to predict the normalized anammox activity (NAA) of anammox granules exposed to various heavy metal concentrations. The joint inhibitory effect tended to exacerbate initially and reversed as the concentrations increased and then moderated again. The most severe inhibition, resulting in a NAA of 20.1%, occurred at Cu(II) and Zn(II) concentrations of 16.3 and 20.0 mg L (1), respectively. Notably, the cumulative toxicity was mitigated with the aid of intermittent exposure acclimatization. Additionally, pre-exposure to Cu(II) in the absence of substrates strongly inhibited anammox activity. However, the presence of NO2 significantly enhanced Cu(II) inhibition. Therefore, such conditions should be avoided to minimize the disturbance of the anammox process. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Molecular sieve SBA-15 was applied for the first time as a solid support in trace MSPD. Parameters, such as the type of dispersant, mass ratio of the sample to the dispersant, grinding time, and elution pH, were optimized in detail. The optimal extraction conditions involved dispersing a powdered fruit peel sample (25 mg) into 25 mg of SBA-15 and then eluting the target analytes with 500 mu L of methanol. A satisfactory linearity (r(2) >0.9990) was obtained, and the calculated limits of detection reached 0.02-0.03 mu g/mL for the compounds. The results showed that the method developed was successfully applied to determine the content of flavonoids in complex fruit peel matrices. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Superoxide anion production rate, hydrogen peroxide concentration, ion leakage level and malondialdehyde content of the cold-stored fruit preradiated with 5 KJ m(-2) UV-B for 4 h were significantly decreased as compared with control fruit. The activities of ROS generating enzymes remained unchanged in UV-B-irradiated mangoes as compared to the control, but superoxide dismutase and catalase activities, ascorbate and polyphenol contents and antioxidant capacities of the cold-stored mangoes were significantly enhanced by UV-B. The UV-B-enhanced antioxidant compounds and antioxidative enzymes were highly correlated with the reduced-ROS levels in UV-B-irradiated mangoes. The data indicated that a short UV-B exposure reduced oxidative stress and alleviated oxidative damage of the cold-stored mangoes by triggering both enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant systems although ROS generation in the fruit was not affected.

Aggregation-induced emission (ATE) effects were observed for the materials, and bipolar characteristics of the molecules are favored with measurement of carrier mobility and calculation of molecular orbitals using density functional theory (DFT). Using the fluorene derivatives as emitting-layer, nondoped organic light-emitting devices (OLEDs) have been fabricated by spin-coating in the configuration ITO/PEDOT:PSS(35 nm)/PVK(15 nm)/PhN-OF(n)-Oxa(80 nm)/SPPO13(30 nm)/Ca(8 nm)/Al(100 nm) (n = 2-4). The best device with PhN-OF(2)-Oxa exhibits a maximum luminance of 14 747 cd/m(2), a maximum current efficiency of 4.61 cd/A, and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.09% in the blue region. Investigation of the correlation between structures and properties indicates that there is no intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) increase in these molecules with the increase of conjugation length. The device using material of the shortest conjugation length as emitting-layer gives the best electroluminescent (EL) performances in this series of oligofluorenes.

The performance and physiological characteristics were tracked by continuous-flow monitoring to evaluate the long-term effects. High Cu loading (0.24g L-1 d(-1)) exceeded sludge bearing capacity, and precipitation dominated the removal pathway. The Cu distribution migrated from the extracellular polymeric substances-bound to the cell-associated Cu and the Cu forms shifted from the weakly bound to strongly bound fractions over time. Pearson correlation and fluorescence spectra analyses showed that the increase in protein concentrations in the EPS was a clear self-defense response to Cu(II) stress. Two remediation strategies, i.e., ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) washing and ultrasound-enhanced EDTA washing, weakened the equilibrium metal partition coefficient from 5.8 to 0.45 and 0.34 Lmg(-1) SS, respectively, thereby accelerating the external diffusion of the Cu that had accumulated in the anammox granules.

Due to the lack of a large-scale longitudinal dataset, the full landscape of variability within and between individual functional connectomes is largely unknown. We collected 300 resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rfMRI) datasets from 30 healthy participants who were scanned every three days for one month. With these data, both intra-and inter-individual variability of six common rfMRI metrics, as well as their test-retest reliability, were estimated across multiple spatial scales. Global metrics were more dynamic than local regional metrics. Cognitive components involving working memory, inhibition, attention, language and related neural networks exhibited high intra-individual variability. In contrast, inter-individual variability demonstrated a more complex picture across the multiple scales of metrics. Limbic, default, frontoparietal and visual networks and their related cognitive components were more differentiable than somatomotor and attention networks across the participants. Analyzing both intra-and inter-individual variability revealed a set of high-resolution maps on test-retest reliability of the multi-scale connectomic metrics. These findings represent the first collection of individual differences in multi-scale and multimetric characterization of the human functional connectomes in-vivo, serving as normal references for the field to guide the use of common functional metrics in rfMRI-based applications.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of decay dynamics and CP asymmetry in D+ -> K(L)(0)e(+)nu(e) decay	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							FORM-FACTORS; HEAVY	Using 2.92 fb(-1) of electron-positron annihilation data collected at root s = 3.773 GeV with the BESIII detector, we obtain the first measurements of the absolute branching fraction B(D+ -> K(L)(0)e(+)nu(e)) = (4.481 +/- 0.027(stat) +/- 0.103(sys))% and the CP asymmetry A(CP)(D+-> KL0e+nu e) = (-0.59 +/- 0.60(stat) +/- 1.48(sys))%. From the D+ -> K(L)(0)e(+)nu(e) differential decay rate distribution, the product of the hadronic form factor and the magnitude of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element, f(+)(K)(0)vertical bar V-cs vertical bar, is determined to be 0.728 +/- 0.006(stat) +/- 0.011(sys). Using vertical bar V-cs vertical bar from the SM constrained fit with the measured f(+)(K)(0)vertical bar V-cs vertical bar, f(+)(K)(0) = 0.748 +/- 0.007(stat) +/- 0.012(sys) is obtained, and utilizing the unquenched Lattice QCD (LQCD) calculation for f(+)(K)(0), vertical bar V-cs vertical bar = 0.975 +/- 0.008(stat) +/- 0.015(sys) +/- 0.025(LQCD).

When, for example, measuring a photon using a Mach-Zehnder interferometer, the photon acts as a wave if the second beam splitter is inserted, but as a particle if this beam splitter is omitted. The decision of whether or not to insert this beam splitter can be made after the photon has entered the interferometer, as in Wheeler's famous delayed-choice thought experiment. In recent quantum versions of this experiment, this decision is controlled by a quantum ancilla, while the beam splitter is itself still a classical object. Here, we propose and realize a variant of the quantum delayed-choice experiment. We configure a superconducting quantum circuit as a Ramsey interferometer, where the element that acts as the first beam splitter can be put in a quantum superposition of its active and inactive states, as verified by the negative values of its Wigner function. We show that this enables the wave and particle aspects of the system to be observed with a single setup, without involving an ancilla that is not itself a part of the interferometer. We also study the transition of this quantum beam splitter from a quantum to a classical object due to decoherence, as observed by monitoring the interferometer output.

In this report, we show that knock-out (KO) of the mouse gene Terc or Tert causes pulmonary alveolar stem cell replicative senescence, epithelial impairment, formation of alveolar sacs, and characteristic inflammatory phenotype. Deficiency in TERC or TERT causes a remarkable elevation in various proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, IL-6, CXCL15 (human IL-8 homolog), IL-10, TNF-alpha, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (chemokine ligand 2 (CCL2)); decrease in TGF-beta 1 and TGF beta RI receptor in the lungs; and spillover of IL-6 and CXCL15 into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluids. In addition to increased gene expressions of alpha-smooth muscle actin and collagen 1 alpha 1, suggesting myofibroblast differentiation, TERC deficiency also leads to marked cellular infiltrations of a mononuclear cell population positive for the leukocyte common antigen CD45, low-affinity Fc receptor CD16/CD32, and pattern recognition receptor CD11b in the lungs. Our data demonstrate for the first time that telomerase deficiency triggers alveolar stem cell replicative senescence-associated low-grade inflammation, thereby driving pulmonary premature aging, alveolar sac formation, and fibrotic lesion.

The use of LUSI in wastewater treatment is presented and compared in terms of different wastewater conditions. The advantages and disadvantages of using LUSI are discussed to effectively grasp the benefits of LUSI in managing wastewater treatment, and the optimal conditions for ultrasound in various wastewater treatments designed for different contaminants are summarized. The main conclusion from the literature review is that LUSI has the potential to improve the activity of enzymes or the permeability of the cell membrane; however, a negative effect of the use of ultrasound in wastewater treatment is the decreased settle ability of sludge. In addition, the review concludes by identifying research needs that should be addressed in the future.

As expected, the presence of CRGO sheets endows epoxy with electrical conductivity and enhances its thermal properties, stiffness and toughness; while the addition of PR results in significant reductions in thermal stability and stiffness, but produces dramatic improvements in fracture toughness. Compared with the binary composites, the ternary composites containing hybrid 2D CRGO and 3D PR fillers provide a good balance among electrical conductivity, thermal stability, glass transition temperature, stiffness, strength and fracture toughness, which cannot be achieved by independent single-phase fillers. Based on the morphologies of the fracture surfaces and damage zones around the crack tip, various toughening mechanisms such as crack-bridging by GO sheets, sheet/sheet delamination and sheet/matrix debonding, rubber cavitation and matrix shear banding, were identified and correlated with the fracture toughness of the hybrid composites studied. Results obtained disclosed suppression of deformation and/or cavitation of the PR nanoparticles after the incorporation of CRGO, which explained the moderate improvement in fracture toughness of the hybrid composites.

Nevertheless, its function in mature neurons has not yet been elucidated. Here we show that cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) express high levels of Numb during adulthood and that conditional deletion of Numb in PCs is sufficient to impair motor coordination despite maintenance of a normal cerebellar cytoarchitecture. Numb proved to be critical for internalization and recycling of metabotropic glutamate 1 receptor (mGlu1) in PCs. A significant decrease of mGlu1 and an inhibition of long-term depression at the parallel fiber-PC synapse were observed in conditional Numb knockout mice. Indeed, the trafficking of mGlu1 induced by agonists was inhibited significantly in these mutants, but the expression of ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and of mGlu1-associated proteins was not affected by the loss of Numb. Moreover, transient and persistent forms of mGlu1 plasticity were robustly induced in mutant PCs, suggesting that they do not require mGlu1 trafficking. Together, our data demonstrate that Numb is a regulator for constitutive expression and dynamic transport of mGlu1.

However, the functional role of the ultra-low frequency band of brain activity during the feedback procedure remains unclear. Here, we carried out an fMRI study of continuous feedback (8 min) of finger force and assessed two important properties of brain activity: the fluctuation amplitude and local synchronization in the ultra-low frequency band. Two intriguing results were obtained: (1) real feedback recruited a stronger fluctuation amplitude and local synchronization in the basal ganglia compared with sham feedback; however, no significant correlation was found between the two properties across subjects; and (2) the behavioral performance was significantly correlated with the fluctuation amplitude but was not correlated with local synchronization in the basal ganglia. These findings contribute to characterization of the functional role of brain activity in the ultra-low frequency band and further suggest that the fluctuation amplitude and local synchronization in the basal ganglia may contribute differently to motor feedback.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Quasi-Free-Standing Features of Stanene/Stanane on In Se and GaTe Nanosheets: A Computational Study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; SILICENE; MONOLAYER; GERMANENE; STANENE; GROWTH; STRAIN	Two-dimensional tin and its iodized derivative, called stanene and stanane, are intriguing nanomaterials as quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators. A recent experiment on stanene has found that the strong interaction from substrates will disturb the Dirac cones and cause a metallicity problem into stanene [F. Zhu et al. Nat. Mater. 2015, 14, 1020]. On the basis of van der Waals density functional calculations, we find that stanene and stanane can form commensurate van der Waals heterosheets with In Se and GaTe layers, which exhibit quasi-free-standing features with comparable spin-orbit coupling gaps to isolate values. Particularly, the supported stanane is still a large-gap QSH insulator, for which the substrates induce a tunable Rashba splitting that can be modulated by changing the interlayer distance of heterosheets. Our study demonstrates that layered III-VI chalcogenides are promising substrates for stanene and stanane, on which their intrinsics features can be well preserved for potential applications in topological materials and quantum manipulated devices.

It is mainly attributable to the greatly different crystallization kinetics of PLLA and POM. At a content of POM (phi(POM)), 3 wt % < phi(POM) < 20 wt %, PLLA crystallization kinetics are comparable to POM, and therefore two type spherulites exhibit "side-byside" simultaneous growth with the penetration of PLLA spherulites into POM crystals. Although crystal growth rate (v(c)) of POM is still a bit faster than that of PLLA, for phi(POM) = 3 wt %, the nucleation of POM is restrained and POM spherulites can only develop on the propagating PLLA growth fronts with the generation of novel "core shell" blended spherulites. For 20 wt % <= phi(PCM) < 80 wt %, interspherulitic growth of PLLA inside the pre-existing matrix of POM spherulites causes the formation of interpenetrated blended spherulites, owing to the large discrepancy in kinetics. At phi(PCM) >= 80 wt %, PLLA molecular chains are redistributed into the interlamellar level regimes within the POM spherulites and can only crystallize into tiny crystals (owing to strong confinement). PLLA/POM blends provide a perfect example and new insights for understanding the crystallization of miscible crystalline/crystalline polymer blends (with very similar T-m's), in which kinetic factors could play a significant role in crystallization behaviors and morphology.

The nonmagnetic state has five Fermi surface sheets involving three quasi-one-dimensional and two three-dimensional energy bands. However, the ground state is magnetic, exhibiting an interlayer antiferromagnetic order where the basic block-spin state of a unit Cr triangle retains a high spin magnitude. Moreover, the magnetic Fermi surface involves three one-dimensional sheets only, manifesting the reduced dimensionality. By fitting a twisted spin tube model, the magnetic frustrations are found to be relaxed, leading to gapless spin excitations. A frustration-induced transition to the disordered low block-spin state is expected upon increasing the intralayer exchange interaction.

We measured the levels of endogenous PAs and H2O2, quantified the expression levels of genes involved in the PAs pathway at various stages of cotton somatic embryogenesis (SE), and investigated the effects of exogenous PAs and H2O2 on differentiation and development of EC. Putrescine (Put), spermidine (Spd), and spermine (Spm) significantly increased from the EC stage to the early phase of embryo differentiation. The levels of Put then decreased until the somatic embryo stage whereas Spd and Spm remained nearly the same. The expression profiles of GhADC genes were consistent with changes in Put during cotton SE. The H2O2 concentrations began to increase significantly at the EC stage, during which time both GhPAO1 and GhPAO4 expressions were highest and PAO activity was significantly increased. Exogenous Put, Spd, Spm, and H2O2 not only enhanced embryogenic callus growth and embryo formation, but also alleviated the effects of D-arginine and 1, 8-diamino-octane, which are inhibitors of PA synthesis and PAO activity. Overall, the results suggest that both PAs and their metabolic product H2O2 are essential for the conversion of EC into somatic embryos in cotton.

Comorbid depression in AD may increase the risk of cognitive decline, impair patients' function, and reduce their quality of life. However, the mechanisms of depression in AD remain unclear. Here, our aim was to identify neurometabolic characteristics in the brain that are associated with depression in patients with mild AD. Methods: Thirty-seven patients were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), and divided into two groups: 17 AD patients with depression (D-AD) and 20 non-depressed AD patients (nD-AD). Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, we characterized neurometabolites in the anterior cingulate gyrus (ACG) of D-AD and nD-AD patients. Results: Compared with nD-AD patients, D-AD patients showed lower N-acetylaspartate/creatine (NAA/Cr) and higher myo-inositol/creatine (mI/Cr) in the left ACG. NPI score correlated with NAA/Cr and mI/Cr in the left ACG, while HAMD correlated with NAA/Cr. Conclusions: Our findings show neurometabolic alterations in D-AD patients. Thus, D-AD pathogenesis may be attributed to abnormal activity of neurons and glial cells in the left ACG.
