The hypothesis that maternal effects act as an adaptive bridge in translating maternal environments into offspring phenotypes, and thereby affecting population dynamics has not been studied in the well-controlled fields. In this study, the effects of maternal population density on offspring stress axis, reproduction and population dynamics were studied in root voles (Microtus oeconomus). Parental enclosures for breeding offspring were established by introducing six adults per sex into each of 4 (low density) and 30 adults per sex into each of another 4 (high density) enclosures. Live-trapping started 2weeks after. Offspring captured at age of 20-30 days were removed to the laboratory, housed under laboratory conditions until puberty, and subsequently used to establish offspring populations in these same enclosures, after parental populations had been removed. [Correction added on 8 January 2015 after first online publication: 10-20 days' has been changed to 20-30 days.'] Offspring from each of the two parental sources were assigned into four enclosures with two for each of the two density treatments used in establishing parental populations (referred to as LL and LH for maternally unstressed offspring, assigned in low and highdensity, and HL and HH for maternally stressed offspring, assigned in low and high density). Faecal corticosterone metabolites (FCM) levels, offspring reproduction traits and population dynamics were tested following repeated live-trapping over two seasons. Differential fluctuations in population size were observed between maternally density-stressed and density-unstressed offspring. Populations in LL and LH groups changed significantly in responding to initial density and reached the similar levels at beginning of the second trapping season. Populations in HL and HH groups, however, were remained relatively steady, and in HL group, the low population size was sustained until end of experiment. Maternal density stress was associated with FCM elevations, reproduction suppression and body mass decrease at sexual maturity in offspring. The FCM elevations and reproduction suppression were independent of offspring population density and correlated with decreased offspring quality. These findings indicate that intrinsic state alterations induced by maternal stress impair offspring capacity in response to immediate environment, and these alterations are likely mediated by maternal stress system. The maladaptive reproduction suppression seen in HL group suggests intrinsic population density as one of ecological factors generating delayed density-dependent effects.

The functionalization steps on the nanofibers were monitored by a field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM), attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR/FT-IR), and an X-ray photoelectron (XPS). The prepared CoPc decorated BC nanocomposite, CoPc@BC, was used as an efficient heterogeneous catalyst for the decoloration of recalcitrant rhodamine B (RhB) dye wastewater. We found that CoPc@BC has high decoloration capacity for RhB dye wastewater. With H2O2 as oxidant, more than 90% of RhB dye molecules can be removed in 180 min. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Acequinocyl and hydroxyacequinocyl were found to be stable in the presence of formic acid at low temperature (-18 A degrees C) in the dark. The target compounds in solid food samples were successively extracted by acetonitrile containing 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid, and then cleaned up by using Florisil columns, and then evaporated to near dryness under a nitrogen stream at 40 A degrees C, and finally dissolved in acetonitrile containing 0.5 % (v/v) formic acid. No matrix effect was observed from any foodstuff. Linear calibration curves with correlation coefficients of 0.9996 for acequinocyl and 0.9998 for hydroxyacequinocyl over the same range 2 to 100 mu g L-1 were obtained. The intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were both superior to 3 % (N = 10) for 5 mu g L-1. The method detection limits were 1.4 mu g kg(-1) for acequinocyl and 1.3 mu g kg(-1) for hydroxyacequinocyl. The method quantification limits were 4.6 and 4.3 mu g kg(-1), respectively, which were at least five times lower than their maximum residue limits for food. Neither acequinocyl nor hydroxyacequinocyl was detected in any foodstuff. The recoveries at spiked levels of 5, 10, and 50 mu g kg(-1) varied in the ranges 81-100 % for acequinocyl and 77-103 % for hydroxyacequinocyl in the foodstuffs, validating the accuracy of the proposed method.

J	Luo, CM; Proctor, RW; Weng, XC				Luo, Chunming; Proctor, Robert W.; Weng, Xuchu			A Stroop effect emerges in the processing of complex Chinese characters that contain a color-related radical	PSYCHOLOGICAL RESEARCH-PSYCHOLOGISCHE FORSCHUNG			English	Article							PHONOLOGICAL ACTIVATION; DILUTION; IDENTIFICATION; INTERFERENCE; AUTOMATICITY; PERCEPTION	Three experiments examined whether a Stroop effect emerges in the processing of complex Chinese characters that contain a color-related radical. In Experiment 1, a Stroop effect occurred when participants responded to the black or white color of the simple characters </InlineMediaObject> (black) and </InlineMediaObject> (white) by making a left or right keypress. For Experiment 2, in which the stimuli were complex characters whose meanings were unrelated to color but that contained </InlineMediaObject> or </InlineMediaObject> as a radical, a Stroop effect also occurred, although it was smaller than in Experiment 1. Furthermore, this Stroop effect as a function of radical meaning was shown again in Experiment 3 for low-frequency complex characters but not high-frequency ones. These results suggest that the semantic representations of the complex characters' color-related radicals are accessed in the context of a Stroop color word task, especially for low-frequency characters. Reduction of the Stroop effect in complex characters composed of one radical with color meaning and one without is similar to dilution of the Stroop effect that occurs when a color word is accompanied by a neutral word. Possible implications of the results for accounts of Stroop dilution are discussed.

Compared to the wild type (WT), the DnWRKY29 transgenic tobacco seeds and seedlings showed more sensitivity to salt and drought stresses. The seed germination rate, seedling root length, and fresh weight of transgenic tobacco were lower than in WT. The activities of peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) in transgenic tobacco were decreased, and the content of malondialdehyde (MDA) in transgenic tobacco was increased. Moreover, the expression of DnWRKY29 was up-regulated in Dendrobium seedlings under salt and drought stresses, which was consistent with the function identified by its overexpression in tobacco, indicating that the up-regulation or overexpression of DnWRKY29 impaired plant tolerance to salt and drought stresses. These results provided a new insight to the low tolerance of Dendrobium seedlings to environmental change.

In our proposal, the sender can successfully teleport the qutrit state to a distant receiver with the help of all agents. However, if one agent in each group does not cooperate, the receiver cannot gain any information (including amplitude information or phase information or both) about the qutrit state to be teleported. Since a qubit is a special case of a qutrit when the state lies in a fixed two-dimensional subspace of the qutrit, the present proposal can be also applied in the implementation of controlled teleportation of an arbitrary unknown pure state of a qubit with many control agents in two groups. We note that our proposal is the first one to use two groups of agents to achieve controlled teleportation.

Based on the differences between the absorption characteristics of P. donghaiense and diatoms from the East China Sea and an extensive in-situ remote sensing reflectance (R-rs) dataset, a multispectral approach for discriminating P. donghaiense blooms from other water types was developed based on MODIS R-rs spectral shape discrimination. The procedure is separated into two steps. First, the bloom waters are identified by the low R-rs(555) and high R-AB owing to their relatively low reflectance and high spectral slope in the green bands. Second, two new indices of P. donghaiense index (PDI) and diatom index (DI) are developed for discriminating P. donghaiense from diatom blooms, based on the distinct spectral differences found in the green and red spectral ranges of phytoplankton absorption between the two algal groups. The validation using observations collected during near-con-current field surveys showed that the application of our practical method to MODIS imagery can provide reliable information on the inferred pattern and spatial distribution of the algal bloom, and that the classification technique for P. donghaiense bloom is considered successful, which may allow coastal mangers to better mitigate the harmful effects of P. donghaiense blooms in the East China Sea.

Cisplatin (DDP) is one of most common chemotherapeutic drugs, but is accompanied by side effects and drug resistance. Our previous studies have shown the strategy of cancer -targeting gene-viro-therapy (CTGVT) mediated by the oncolytic virus ZD55 containing the XAF1 cDNA (ZD55XAF1), which exhibited potent antitumor effects in various tumor cells and no apparent toxicities on normal cells. In the study, the CTGVT strategy is broadened by combining DDP with ZD55-XAF1 for growth inhibition of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells. Methods The transgenic expression was evaluated by both in vitro and in vivo experiments, and the enhanced inhibitory effect of ZD55-XAF1 combined with cisplatin was assessed in HCC cells. The cytotoxicity on normal liver cells was evaluated by MTT assay and apoptotic cell staining. Activation of caspase-9 and PARP for apoptosis was further detected by Western blot analysis. The in vivo antitumor efficacy of combination treatment with cisplatin and ZD55-XAF1 was estimated in an HCC xenograft mouse model. Results We found that the combination of ZD55-XAF1 and cisplatin showed enhanced inhibitory effects on the proliferation of HCC cells in vitro and tumor growth in mice. Furthermore, the combined treatment of ZD55-XAF1 and DDP decreases the chemotherapy dose needed to achieve the same inhibitory effect without overlapping toxicities on normal liver cells and induces tumor cell apoptosis via the activation of caspase-9/PARP pathway. Conclusion Thus, these data suggest that the chemogene-viro-therapeutic strategy by combining ZD55-XAF1 and DDP reveals a novel therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma.

Impact of land-use on carbon storage as dependent on soil texture: Evidence from a desertified dryland using repeated paired sampling design	JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Carbon storage; Desert grassland; Land-use type; Paired sampling; Sandy grassland; Soil texture	NUTRIENT DYNAMICS; NORTHERN CHINA; GRASSLAND; NITROGEN; FOREST; ECOSYSTEMS; MINERALIZATION; SEQUESTRATION; CONVERSION; RANGELANDS	Desertification resulting from land-use affects large dryland areas around the world, accompanied by carbon loss. However it has been difficult to interpret different land-use contributions to carbon pools owing to confounding factors related to climate, topography, soil texture and other original soil properties. To avoid such confounding effects, a unique systematic and extensive repeated design of paired sampling plots of different land-use types was adopted on Ordos Plateau, N China. The sampling enabled to quantify the effects of the predominant land-use types on carbon storage as dependent on soil texture, and to define the most promising land-use choices for carbon storage, both in grassland on sandy soil and in desert grassland on brown calcareous soil. The results showed that (1) desertification control should be an effective measure to improve the carbon sequestration in sandy grassland, and shrub planting should be better than grass planting; (2) development of man-made grassland should be a good choice to solve the contradictions of ecology and economy in desert grassland; (3) grassland on sandy soil is more vulnerable to soil degradation than desert grassland on brown calcareous soil. The results may be useful for the selection of land-use types, aiming at desertification prevention in drylands. Follow-up studies should directly investigate the role of soil texture on the carbon storage dynamic caused by land-use change. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We propose a mechanistic semi-analytic algorithm (MeSAA) to estimate sea surface pCO(2) in river-dominated coastal oceans using satellite data. Observed pCO(2) can be analytically expressed as the sum of individual components controlled by major factors such as thermodynamics (or temperature), mixing, and biology. With marine carbonate system calculations, temperature and mixing effects can be predicted using thermodynamic principles and by assuming conservative two end-member mixing of total dissolved inorganic carbon and total alkalinity (e.g., the Changjiang River and Kuroshio water in the East China Sea, ECS). Next, an integral expression for pCO(2) drawdown due to biological effects can be parameterized using the chlorophyll a concentration (chla). We demonstrate the validity and applicability of the algorithm in the ECS during summertime. Sensitivity analysis shows that errors in empirical coefficients and three input satellite parameters (salinity, SST, chla) have limited influence on the algorithm, and satellite-derived pCO(2) is consistent with underway data, even though no in situ pCO(2) data from the ECS shelves was used to train the algorithm. Our algorithm has more physical and biogeochemical mechanistic meaning than empirical methods, and should be applicable to other similar systems.

S1 shows high selectivity and sensitivity toward F- ions among several tested anions (Cl-, Br-, I-, OAc-, NO3-, HSO4-, H2PO4-, CN-) in CHCl3. Upon addition of F- ions, the maximum absorption band of S1 in CHCl3 displayed a red shift from 581 to588 nm. This shift was visually manifested as a color change from pink to blue. When excited at 550 nm, the fluorescent emission intensity of S1 at 608 nm was quenched to over 87% of its initial value. Both a Job'splot and H-1 NMR spectra analysis revealed a 1:1 stoichiometric relationship between S1 and the added F- ions. Moreover, we found that the absorption and fluorescence of the S1-F- complex was reversible upon addition of HSO(4)(-)ions. Finally, by using F- and HSO4- ions as chemical inputs and the absorbance and fluorescence intensity as outputs, a complementary INHIBIT/IMPLICATION (INH/IMP) logic gate was constructed at the nanoscale level.

The obtained molecules had both epoxide groups and long PMMA side chains distributed randomly along the PMMA backbone. The synthesized RC polymers were applied as compatibilizers in an immiscible poly(l-lactic acid)/poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PLLA/PVDF) system. Compared to their linear counterparts, only 1 wt % of RC polymers with appropriate length of side chains significantly reduced the size and enhanced the uniformity of the PVDF dispersed phase in PLLA matrix and the RC-compatibilized blends exhibited a significant improvement in fracture strain. The higher compatibilization efficiency of RC polymers was ascribed to the existence of PMMA side chains, which improved the stability of RC polymers at the interface of immiscible blend, and this was demonstrated by transmission electron microscopy.

Heavy surface state in a possible topological Kondo insulator: Magnetothermoelectric transport on the (011) plane of SmB6	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article								Motivated by the high sensitivity to Fermi surface topology and scattering mechanisms in magnetothermoelectric transport, we have measured the thermopower and Nernst effect on the (011) plane of the proposed topological Kondo insulator SmB6. These experiments, together with electrical resistivity and Hall effect measurements, suggest that the (011) plane also harbors a metallic surface with an effective mass on the order of 10-10(2) m(0). The surface and bulk conductances are well distinguished in these measurements and are categorized into metallic and nondegenerate semiconducting regimes, respectively. Electronic correlations play an important role in enhancing scattering and also contribute to the heavy surface state.	[Luo, Yongkang; Thompson, J.

Thermal conductivity across the metal-insulator transition in the single-crystalline hyperkagome antiferromagnet Na3+xIr3O8	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SPIN LIQUIDS; BISMUTH; HEAT	The hyperkagome antiferromagnet Na4Ir3O8 represents the first genuine candidate for the realization of a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid. It can also be doped towards a metallic state, thus offering a rare opportunity to explore the nature of the metal-insulator transition in correlated, frustrated magnets. Here, we report thermodynamic and transport measurements in both metallic and weakly insulating single crystals down to 150 mK. While in the metallic sample the phonon thermal conductivity (kappa(ph)) is almost in the boundary scattering regime, in the insulating sample, we find a large reduction kappa(ph) over a very wide temperature range. This result can be ascribed to the scattering of phonons off the gapless magnetic excitations that are seen in the low-temperature specific heat. This works highlights the peculiarity of the metal-insulator transition in Na3+xIr3O8 and demonstrates the importance of the coupling between lattice and spin degrees of freedom in the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling.

Using the latest updated Medicago truncatula reference genome sequence, a comprehensive characterization and analysis of 24 MtARF (M. truncatula ARF) genes were performed. To uncover the basic information and functions of MtARF genes during symbiosis, we analyzed the expression patterns of MtARF genes during the early phase of Sinorhizobium meliloti infection. The systematic analysis indicated that changes in MtARF gene expression occur during these early stages of infection, suggesting a functional role in symbiosis. Furthermore, the roles of MtARF-mediated auxin signaling in symbiosis were tested in the infection resistant mutant (dmi3). The expression responses of MtARFs to S. meliloti infection were attenuated in the mutant compared to wild-type A17. In summary, our results show that changes in MtARF gene expression occur during the response to S. meliloti infection, suggesting that members of this family may have important roles in the symbiotic interaction.

Eugene			Toward link predictability of complex networks	PROCEEDINGS OF THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA			English	Article						link prediction; complex networks; structural perturbation; predictability	RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS; SOCIAL NETWORKS; PREDICTION; BEHAVIOR; WEB	The organization of real networks usually embodies both regularities and irregularities, and, in principle, the former can be modeled. The extent to which the formation of a network can be explained coincides with our ability to predict missing links. To understand network organization, we should be able to estimate link predictability. We assume that the regularity of a network is reflected in the consistency of structural features before and after a random removal of a small set of links. Based on the perturbation of the adjacency matrix, we propose a universal structural consistency index that is free of prior knowledge of network organization. Extensive experiments on disparate real-world networks demonstrate that (i) structural consistency is a good estimation of link predictability and (ii) a derivative algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art link prediction methods in both accuracy and robustness. This analysis has further applications in evaluating link prediction algorithms and monitoring sudden changes in evolving network mechanisms. It will provide unique fundamental insights into the above-mentioned academic research fields, and will foster the development of advanced information filtering technologies of interest to information technology practitioners.

Using the Born-Markovian quantum master equation in the polaron basis we investigate the nonequilibrium photon state and emission spectrum of the resonator as well as properties of the transport current across the tunnel junction and its noise spectrum. The electroluminescence is optimized, with maximum peak height and narrow linewidth, when the back-action of the tunnel junction on the resonator and the damping of the resonator are similar in strength. For strong coupling between the resonator and tunnel junction, multiphoton effects create signatures in the transport current and current noise spectrum.

However, the resulting information is almost exclusively derived from a few model organisms, including A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, but little is known about rare pathogens. In this study, we performed a genomics based discovery of SM biosynthetic gene clusters in Aspergillus ustus, a rare human pathogen. A total of 52 gene clusters were identified in the draft genome of A. ustus 3.3904, such as the sterigmatocystin biosynthesis pathway that was commonly found in Aspergillus species. In addition, several SM biosynthetic gene clusters were firstly identified in Aspergillus that were possibly acquired by horizontal gene transfer, including the vrt cluster that is responsible for viridicatumtoxin production. Comparative genomics revealed that A. ustus shared the largest number of SM biosynthetic gene clusters with A. nidulans, but much fewer with other Aspergilli like A. niger and A. oryzae. These findings would help to understand the diversity and evolution of SM biosynthesis pathways in genus Aspergillus, and we hope they will also promote the development of fungal identification methodology in clinic.

The structure and properties of the composites have been investigated. Organoclay was selectively located in the crosslinked EVM phase for all the samples by the two strategies. However, it was found that the composites fabricated by the two-step strategy have much smaller phase size and the organocaly shows much higher exfoliation efficiency than those fabricated by onestep strategy. It was further found that the composites fabricated by the two-step strategy exhibit much better physical properties than those by one-step strategy. The tensile strength and elongation at break are 15. 5 MPa and 856% for the two-step fabricated sample with 5% organoclay, respectively, as compared with 9. 1 MPa and 423% for the one-step fabricated sample. Moreover, the limit oxygen index (LOI) of the two-step fabricated samples is also higher than that of the one-step fabricated sample.

However, no study has yet investigated the test-retest (TRT) reliability of the graph metrics of white matter (WM) structural brain networks constructed from this new sequence. Here, we employed a multiband diffusion MRI (dMRI) dataset with repeated scanning sessions and constructed both low- and high-resolution WM networks by volume- and surface-based parcellation methods. The reproducibility of network metrics and its dependence on type of construction procedures was assessed by the intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC). We observed conserved topological architecture of VVM structural networks constructed from the multiband dMRI data as previous findings from conventional dMRI. For the global network properties, the first order metrics were more reliable than second order metrics. Between two parcellation methods, networks with volume-based parcellation showed better reliability than surface-based parcellation, especially for the global metrics. Between different resolutions, the high-resolution network exhibited higher TRT performance than the low-resolution in terms of the global metrics with a large effect size, whereas the low-resolution performs better in terms of local (region and connection) properties with a relatively low effect size. Moreover, we identified that the association and primary cortices showed higher reproducibility than the paralimbic/limbic regions. The important hub regions and rich-club connections are more reliable than the non-hub regions and connections. Finally, we found VVM networks from the multiband dMRI showed higher reproducibility compared with those from the conventional dMRI. Together, our results demonstrated the fair to good reliability of the WM structural brain networks from the multiband EPI sequence, suggesting its potential utility for exploring individual differences and for clinical applications.

The sample consisted of 524 preschool students from 3 cities of Shandong province in northern China. Mothers reported children's shyness, school liking, and school avoidance, whereas teachers rated children's cooperative and independent participation and reported perceived teacher-child relationships. Overall, findings indicated that shyness was associated with lower teacher-child closeness, lower school liking, and higher school avoidance. Child gender moderated the relationship between shyness and teacher-child dependency. Moreover, teacher-child relationship and child gender moderated the shyness-adjustment relationships. Practice or Policy: These findings point to the potential for improving teacher-child relationships to facilitate shy preschoolers' school adjustment and the importance of taking child gender into consideration in such intervention programs.

In this study our primary objective is to explore the role of SLMAP gene polymorphisms in the susceptibility of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) with or without diabetic retinopathy (DR) in the Qatari population. Methods: A total of 342 Qatari subjects (non-diabetic controls and T2DM patients with or without DR) were genotyped for SLMAP gene polymorphisms (rs17058639 C > T; rs1043045 C > T and rs1057719 A > G) using Taqman SNP genotyping assay. Results: SLMAP rs17058639 C > T polymorphism was associated with the presence of DR among Qataris with T2DM. One-way ANOVA and multiple logistic regression analysis showed SLMAP SNP rs17058639 C > T as an independent risk factor for DR development. SLMAP rs17058639 C > T polymorphism also had a predictive role for the severity of DR. Haplotype C(rs17058639)T(rs1043045)A(rs1057719) was associated with the increased risk for DR among Qataris with T2DM.

Formation of the radical cation M+center dot in the ESI process has attracted our interest to perform further investigation. METHODSA series of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles were investigated using a quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer equipped with an ESI source or an atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI) source in the positive-ion mode. Theoretical calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. RESULTSBoth the radical ion M+center dot and the protonated molecule [M+H](+) were obtained by ESI-MS analysis of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles, while only [M+H](+) was observed in the APCI-MS analysis. The relative intensities of M+center dot and [M+H](+) were significantly affected by several ESI operating parameters and the nature of the substituents. CONCLUSIONSFormation of M+center dot and [M+H](+) was rationalized as two competing ionization processes in the ESI-MS analysis of indolyl benzo[b]carbazoles.

Chilling injury index, ion leakage, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content of the fruit pretreated with 5 kJ m(-2) UV-B for 4 h were significantly lower than those of the control during fruit ripening at ambient temperature following cold storage at 6 degrees C for 10 days. Fruit firmness of the mangoes irradiated with UV-B was significantly higher than the control during the ripening period. Endogenous NO levels of the UV-B-irradiated fruit were rapidly increased after UV-B treatment. Pre-treatment of mangoes with the NO specific scavenger, not only abolished UV-B-triggered NO accumulation, but also suppressed the UV-B-reduced chilling injury, oxidative damage, and ripening delay of the fruit. Together, the results suggest that UV-B treatment may enhance chilling tolerance and delay fruit ripening of mangoes by triggering endogenous NO generation in the fruit. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Moreover, this QSL time is applicable to either Markovian or non-Markovian dynamics. By using of a hierarchy equation method, we numerically study the QSL time bound in a qubit system interacting with a single broadened cavity mode without rotating-wave, Born and Markovian approximation. By comparing with rotating-wave approximation (RWA) results, we show that the counter-rotating terms are helpful to increase evolution speed. The problem of non-Markovianity is also considered. We find that for non-RWA cases, increasing system-bath coupling can not always enhance the non-Markovianity, which is qualitatively different from the results with RWA. When considering the relation between QSL and non-Markovianity, we find that for small broadening widths of the cavity mode, non-Markovianity can increase the evolution speed in either RWA or non-RWA cases, while, for larger broadening widths, it is not true for non-RWA cases.

In the present study, a set of 320 Dendrobium SSR markers were applied to test their transferability and polymorphism in this large plant family, and 109 of them showed high transferability (an average of 24.71%) and polymorphism (an average of 85.91%) across 44 species of 15 Orchidaceae genera. Ten SSR loci were randomly selected for DNA sequencing, and sequence alignment analysis revealed nucleotide variation of the SSR motifs and repeat lengths among Orchidaceae taxa. Those polymorphic SSR markers were further used for phylogeny analysis and the results showed a complex genetic architecture among genera but a relatively uniform structure in the same genus. These 109 cross-taxon transferable microsatellite markers enrich the available resource of molecular markers, which would facilitate further evolution and genetic diversity studies, germplasm appraisal and molecular breeding of Orchidaceae species.

However, its poor solubility in aqueous systems and in food grade solvents (oils) limits its extensive applications. The aim of this study was to improve the solubility of norartocarpetin by developing an oil-in-water (o/w) microemulsion with food grade components. A microemulsion was developed and characterized, and its chemical and physical stabilities were also evaluated within 8 weeks. Using the construction of pseudoternary phase diagrams, the optimized formulation of 2% w/w of ethyl oleate, 12% w/w of Tween 80, 6% w/w of polyethylene glycol 400, and 80% w/w of water was obtained, with a maximum solubility of norartocarpetin up to 1.73 +/- 0.21 mg/mL, at least a 1000-fold increase in solubility. The microemulsion base and norartocarpetin-loaded microemulsion were demonstrated to be stable after accelerated and long-term conditions (8 weeks). The norartocarpetin microemulsion still showed strong tyrosinase inhibitory activity and antibrowning effect on fresh-cut apple slices. These combined results indicated that norartocarpetin microemulsion may be suitable as an antibrowning agent for fresh-cut fruits.

We have cloned kinesin-like gene kifc3 (termed ec-kifc3) from the total RNA of the testis of the skink Eumeces chinensis. The cDNA sequence of ec-kifc3 had a full-length of 3033 bp, including a 260 bp 5'-untranslated region (5'UTR), a 445 bp 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR) and an open reading frame that encoded a 775-amino-acid protein. Additionally, the calculated molecular weight of the putative ec-KIFC3 was 87 kDa and its estimated isoelectric point was 618. Structurally, the putative ec-KIFC3 had three domains: head domain, neck domain and tail domain. Protein alignment demonstrated that ec-KIFC3 had 47.2%, 67.8%, 68.8%, 693% and 76.8% identity with its homologues in Xenopus laevis, Mus musculus, Cricetulus griseus, Homo sapiens, and Gallus gallus. The phylogenetic analysis showed that ec-KIFC3 was more related to KIFC3 in vertebrates than invertebrates. Tissue expression results showed the presence of ec-KIFC3 in various tissues with its highest expression in the testis. In situ hybridization demonstrated that ec-KIFC3 mRNA was distributed around the nucleus in early and middle stage spermatids and expressed in the nucleus in the elongating spermatids during spermiogenesis. Besides, the ec-KIFC3 mRNA was expressed in the acrosome of the developmental spermatids. From the results of in situ hybridization and previous researches, we speculated that ec-KIFC3 may play a role in nuclear morphogenesis and acrosome formation during spermiogenesis of E. chinensis.

We use the Five-Flavor-Number Schemes (5FNS) with massless bottom quark assumption in the whole calculation. Our results show that the QCD NLO corrections can reduce the scale uncertainty. The typical K-factors are in the range of 1.15 to 1.2 which lead to the QCD NLO corrections of 15% to 20% correspond to the leading-order (LO) predictions with our chosen parameters.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurement of the D*(0) decay branching fractions	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							QCD	Using 482 pb(-1) of data taken at root s = 4.009 GeV, we measure the branching fractions of the decays of D*(0) into D-0 pi(0) and D-0 gamma to be B(D*(0) -> D-0 pi(0)) = (65.5 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.5)% and B(D*(0) -> D0 gamma) = (34.5 +/- 0.8 +/- 0.5)%, respectively, by assuming that the D*(0) decays only into these two modes. The ratio of the two branching fractions is B(D*(0) -> D-0 pi(0))/B(D*(0) -> D-0 gamma) = 1.90 +/- 0.07 +/- 0.05, which is independent of the assumption made above. The first uncertainties are statistical and the second ones systematic. The precision is improved by a factor of 3 compared to the present world average values.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for the Y(4140) via e(+)e(-) -> gamma phi J/psi at root s=4.23, 4.26 and 4.36 GeV	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BESIII	Using data samples collected at center-of-mass energies root s = 4.23, 4.26, and 4.36 GeV with the BESIII detector operating at the BEPCII storage ring, we search for the production of the charmoniumlike state Y(4140) through a radiative transition followed by its decay to phi J/psi. No significant signal is observed and upper limits on sigma[e(+)e(-) -> gamma Y(4140)] . B(Y(4140) -> phi J/psi at the 90% confidence level are estimated as 0.35, 0.28, and 0.33 pb at root s = 4.23, 4.26, and 4.36 GeV, respectively.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J.

Genes from Catharanthus roseus encoding strictosidine synthase (STR) and geraniol 10-hydroxylase (G10H), were separately and simultaneously introduced into Ophiorrhiza pumila hairy roots. Overexpression of individual G10H (G lines) significantly improved CPT production with respect to non-transgenic hairy root cultures (NC line) and single STR overexpressing lines (S lines), indicating that G10H plays a more important role in stimulating CPT accumulation than STR in O. pumila. Furthermore, co-overexpression of G10H and STR genes (SG Lines) caused a 56% increase on the yields of CPT compared to NC line and single gene transgenic lines, showed that simultaneous introduction of G10H and STR can produce a synergistic effect on CPT biosynthesis in O. pumila. The MTT assay results indicated that CPT extracted from different lines showed similar anti-tumor activity, suggesting that transgenic O. pumila hairy root lines could be an alternative approach to obtain CPT. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the enhancement of CPT production in O. pumila employing a metabolic engineering strategy.

Focusing on PD patients with tremor, this study investigated their discoordination patterns of spontaneous brain activity by combining voxel-wise centrality, seed-based functional connectivity, and network efficiency methods. Sixteen patients and 20 matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited and underwent structural and resting-state functional MRI scan. Compared with the HCs, the patients exhibited increased centrality in the frontal, parietal, and occipital regions while decreased centrality in the cerebellum anterior lobe and thalamus. Seeded at these regions, a distributed network was further identified that encompassed cortical (default mode network, sensorimotor cortex, prefrontal and occipital areas) and subcortical (thalamus and basal ganglia) regions and the cerebellum and brainstem. Graph-based analyses of this network revealed increased information transformation efficiency in the patients. Moreover, the identified network correlated with clinical manifestations in the patients and could distinguish the patients from HCs. Morphometric analyses revealed decreased gray matter volume in multiple regions that largely accounted for the observed functional abnormalities. Together, these findings provide a comprehensive view of network disorganization in PD with tremor and have important implications for understanding neural substrates underlying this specific type of PD.

Here we identify a mechanism that limits the inflammatory response. Probing the responses of macrophages to the key sensory Toll-like receptors, we identify that the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-abrac/ poxvirus and zinc finger (BTB/POZ), transcriptional regulator promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) limits the expression of inflammatory gene products. In accord with this finding, PLZF-deficient animals express higher levels of potent inflammatory cytokines and mount exaggerated inflammatory responses to infectious stimuli. Temporal quantitation of inflammatory gene transcripts shows increased gene induction in the absence of PLZF. Genome-wide analysis of histone modifications distinguish that PLZF establishes basal activity states of early response genes to maintain immune homeostasis and limit damaging inflammation. We show that PLZF stabilizes a corepressor complex that encompasses histone deacetylase activity to control chromatin. Together with our previous demonstration that PLZF promotes the antiviral response, these results suggest a strategy that could realize one of the major goals of immune therapy to retain immune resistance to pathogens while curbing damaging inflammation.

Although much is known about plasticity in seed plants in terms of functional clonal traits while little is known about ferns. Variation of functional clonal traits of two ferns Dicranopteris dichotoma and Diplopterygium glaucum among plots differing in elevation in a subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest in southern China was investigated. Along with elevation increasing the two fern species showed similar variation pattern of functional clonal traits: stable spacer length, increasing specific spacer length and decreasing spacer weight per ramet and specific spacer weight. The two ferns species had similar variation pattern of ramet performance traits but different variation pattern of ramet population properties. These results suggest an evolutionary trade-off between functions of foraging for and storing of resources in the two ferns, with a functional preference for the foraging in response to environmental change.

We present here the Tangent Injury Severity Score (TISS), which transforms the Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) as a predictor of mortality. Material and methods: The TISS is defined as the sum of the tangent function of AIS/6 to the power 3.04 multiplied by 18.67 of a patient's three most severe AIS injuries regardless of body regions. TISS values were calculated for every patient in two large independent data sets: 3,908 and 4,171 patients treated during a 6-year period at level-3 first-class comprehensive hospitals: the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University and Fengtian Hospital Affiliated to Shenyang Medical College, China. The power of TISS to predict mortality was compared with previously calculated NISS values for the same patients in each data set. Results: The TISS is more predictive of survival than NISS (Hangzhou: receiver operating characteristic (ROC): NISS = 0.929, TISS = 0.949; p = 0.002; Shenyang: ROC: NISS = 0.924, TISS = 0.942; p = 0.008). Moreover, TISS provides a better fit throughout its entire range of prediction (Hosmer Lemeshow statistic for Hangzhou NISS = 29.71; p < 0.001, TISS = 19.59; p = 0.003; Hosmer Lemeshow statistic for Shenyang NISS = 33.49; p < 0.001, TISS = 21.19; p = 0.002). Conclusions: The TISS shows more accurate prediction of prognosis and a linear relation to mortality. The TISS might be a better injury scoring tool with simple computation.

Pip, with the gift from Magwitch, follows the trend of social mobility but fails to model himself as a gentleman. The gift, which enables him to climb to a higher stratum of the society, implicates the illusion of moral righteousness and the original sin of capital. The forging and melting of power reveals the hardship that one may encounter in the upward endeavor of social mobility. This novel exemplifies Dickens' reconsideration of and worry about the decline of industrial spirit in the value judgments of British culture.

It is a useful technique that can be applied for video displaying, storage, and communication. In this paper, we propose a new summarization technique that enforces video stability and preserves well-aesthetic frames. In particular, a multitask feature selection is introduced to efficiently discover the semantically important features. Then, the key frames are selected based on their contributions to reconstruct the video semantics. Thereafter, a probabilistic model is proposed to dynamically fit the key frames into an aesthetically pleasing video summary, wherein its constituent frames are adaptively destabilized. Experimental results on multiple videos taken from prominent sceneries throughout the world demonstrate the descriptiveness, aesthetics, and stability of the generated summary.

However, its detection is challenging due to varying backgrounds, low contrast between text and non-text regions, perspective distortion and other disturbing factors. In this paper, we propose a novel text line detection method which can detect text line aligned with a straight line in any direction. It is mainly composed of three steps. In the first step, we use the maximal stable extremal region detector with dam line constraint to detect candidate text regions, we then define a similarity measurement between two regions which combines sizes, absolute distance, relative distance, contextual information and color histograms. In the second step, we propose a text line identification algorithm based on the defined similarity measurement. The algorithm firstly searches three regions as the seeds of a line, and then expands to obtain all regions in the line. In the last step, we develop a filter to remove non-text lines. The filter uses a sparse classifier based on two dictionaries which are learned from feature vectors extracted from morphological skeletons of those candidate text lines. A comparative study using two datasets shows the excellent performance of the proposed method for accurate text line detection with horizontal or arbitrary consistent orientation.

The chemically bonded PSQ-PAS thin films were obtained via sol-gel process after addition of hydrophilic cosolvent to PSQ-PAS emulsion and subsequent drying at room temperature. The effects of silica/PSQ-PA ratio (w/w) on the film properties of hardness, optical property and thermal stability were investigated. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) were used to characterize the chemical composition and morphology of the resultant hybrid particles. DLS and TEM results indicated that both PSQ and PSQ-PA particles had narrow size distribution and their average diameters were about 200 and 350 nm, respectively. Pendulum durometer, UV-vis spectroscopy, and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) were used to characterize the hardness, optical property and thermal stability of PSQ-PAS latex films. The results showed that the PSQ-PAS films hardness increased with the increasing ratio of silica/PSQ-PA, whereas the transmittance decreased slightly. TGA curves demonstrated PSQ-PAS films displayed excellent thermal stability, and the residual silicon weight exceeded 30%. POLYM. COMPOS., 36:389-396, 2015.

In this study, a special tablet containing carbon dioxide sources (sodium dihydrogenphosphate and sodium carbonate) and the sorbent (mesoporous hybrid materials) was prepared. The effects of different parameters influencing the extraction efficiency such as the concentration of salts, the type and concentration of mesoporous material, pH of diluent, and desorption solvents were investigated and optimized. Results show that the proposed method using green solvents (water) as extraction solutions required low consumption of sample amount and obtained high enrichment efficiency. Moreover, under optimized conditions, the tested tanshinones exhibited good linearity (r (2) > 0.994) in the concentration range of 0.5 to 80 ng mL(-1). The limits of detection values were lower than 0.0803 pg using UV-visible detection. The developed method was successfully applied for the analysis of trace tanshinones in compound Danshen dripping pill and Danqi tablet samples.

Herein, creep and recovery behaviors of polystyrene (PS) composites filled with various loadings of chemically reduced graphene oxide (CRGO) were investigated at different environment temperatures. As expected, incorporation of CRGO into PS polymer increases the thermal stability, glass transition temperature and elastic modulus, although the tensile strength of the composite has a slight decrease. It was found that the creep deformation and strain rate of PS polymer reduce with decreasing temperature and with increasing loading of CRGO. A significant improvement in the recovered strain of PS was also obtained after the presence of CRGO. Based on the analytical modelings (Burger's model and Weibull distribution function) and experimental results, the role of CRGO on improving the creep and recovery performance of thermoplastics was proposed and discussed.

In this study, we cloned a GILT gene homolog from goldfish (designated gGILT), a kind of precious freshwater fish with high market value. The open reading frame of gGILT consists of 756 bases encoding a protein of 251 amino acids with an estimated molecular mass of 27.8 kDa and a theoretical isoelectric point of 5.24. The deduced protein possesses the typical structural features of known GILT proteins, including an active-site motif, a GILT signature sequence, and 10 conserved cysteines. RT-PCR results showed that gGILT and gIFN-gamma (goldfish IFN-gamma) mRNA were expressed in a tissue-specific manner and obviously up-regulated in splenocytes and the cells from head kidney after induction with LPS. Recombinant gGILT fused with His6 tag was efficiently expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) and purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. Further study revealed that gGILT was capable of catalyzing the reduction of the interchain disulfide bonds from intact IgG. This study shows that gGILT may be involved in the immune response to bacteria challenge and maintain first line of innate immune defense at basal level in goldfish. It also provides the basis for investigating on the role of GILT using goldfish as an animal model. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Methods: Several electronic databases were searched for eligible articles. Twelve studies involving 2,233 cases and 2,655 controls were retrieved and analyzed. Odds ratios (ORs) along with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of relationship between the IL-8 polymorphisms and periodontitis risk. Results: No significant association was found for IL-8 -251A/T polymorphism with periodontitis in the overall analysis and stratification by periodontitis type and smoking status. Subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed that -251A/T T allele and TT genotype were associated with decreased risk of periodontitis in a Brazilian mixed population (T allele versus A allele: OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.94, P-heterogeneity = 0.30; TT versus AA: OR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46 to 0.93, P-heterogeneity = 0.39; TT versus AA/AT: OR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.98, P-heterogeneity = 0.01). In addition, -251A/T T allele was associated with increased periodontitis risk in Asians. Pooled estimates showed that the -845T/C polymorphism was associated with periodontitis susceptibility in overall analysis and the chronic periodontitis subgroup. In addition, marginal associations were observed between -845T/C polymorphism and periodontitis in a Brazilian mixed population. Moreover, this association was also confirmed to be significant in Brazilian non-smokers. Conclusion: This meta-analysis indicated that both IL-8 -251A/T and -845T/C polymorphisms may be involved in the development of periodontitis in a Brazilian mixed population, whereas the -251A/T allele T appeared to be a risk factor for periodontitis in Asians.

Alterations in these systems, in particular in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex (PACC), seem to play a central role in bipolar disorder (BD). However, the exact role of the PACC, and its functional connections to other midline regions (within and outside DMN) still remains unclear in BD. Methods: We investigated functional connectivity (FC), standard deviation (SD, as a measure of neuronal variability) and their correlation in bipolar patients (n=40) versus healthy controls (n=40), in the PACC and in its connections in different frequency bands (standard: 0.01-0.10 Hz; Slow-5: 0.01-0.027 Hz; Slow-4: 0.027-0.073 Hz). Finally, we studied the correlations between FC alterations and clinical-neuropsychological parameters and we explored whether subgroups of patients in different phases of the illness present different patterns of FC abnormalities. Results: We found in BD decreased FC (especially in Slow-5) from the PACC to other regions located predominantly in the posterior DMN (such as the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and inferior temporal gyrus) and in the SN (such as the supragenual anterior cingulate cortex and ventrolateral prefrontal cortex). Second, we found in BD a decoupling between PACC-based FC and variability in the various target regions (without alteration in variability itself). Finally, in our subgroups explorative analysis, we found a decrease in FC between the PACC and supragenual ACC (in depressive phase) and between the PACC and PCC (in manic phase). Conclusions: These findings suggest that in BD the communication, that is, information transfer, between the different cortical midline regions within the cingulate gyrus does not seem to work properly. This may result in dysbalance between different resting state networks like the DMN and SN. A deficit in the anterior DMN-SN connectivity could lead to an abnormal shifting toward the DMN, while a deficit in the anterior DMN-posterior DMN connectivity could lead to an abnormal shifting toward the SN, resulting in excessive focusing on internal contents and reduced transition from idea to action or in excessive focusing on external contents and increased transition from idea to action, respectively, which could represent central dimensions of depression and mania. If confirmed, they could represent diagnostic markers in BD. Hum Brain Mapp 36:666-682, 2015. (c) 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Several phytohormones, including auxin, are involved in iron uptake and homeostasis. However, the mechanisms behind how auxin participates in the iron deficiency response in rice are largely unknown. We found that OsARF16 was involved in the iron deficiency response and the induction of iron deficiency response genes. Most Fe-deficient symptoms could be partially restored in the osarf16 mutant, including dwarfism, photosynthesis decline, a reduction in iron content and root system architecture (RSA) regulation. OsARF16 expression was induced in the roots and shoots by Fe deprivation. Restoration of the phenotype could also be mimicked by 1-NOA, an auxin influx inhibitor. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR data indicated that the induction of Fe-deficiency response genes by iron deficiency was more compromised in the osarf16 mutant than in Nipponbare. In conclusion, osarf16, an auxin insensitive mutant, was involved in iron deficiency response in rice. Our results reveal a new biological function for OsARF16 and provide important information on how ARF-medicated auxin signaling affects iron signaling and the iron deficiency response. This work may help us to improve production or increased Fe nutrition of rice to iron deficiency by regulating auxin signaling. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

Increased levels of inflammatory factors, including C-reactive protein (CRP), in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may affect myocardial perfusion. However, why the no-reflow phenomenon increases in inflammation stress after PCI is not clear. The aim of the present study was to determine the effects and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of CRP on the expression of cyclo-oxygenase (COX) on the development of the no-reflow phenomenon. There was a significant increase in plasma levels of CRP and interleukin (IL)-6 in no-reflow patients, suggesting that inflammatory factors play an important role in the development of the no-reflow phenomenon. The mechanisms involved were further evaluated after reperfusion in a rat model mimicking the no-reflow phenomenon. Compared with normal reflow rats, there were significant increases in both COX-1 and COX-2 in cardiac tissue from no-reflow rats. The COX inhibitor indomethacin (5mg/kg, i.p.) significantly reduced the no-reflow area. In another series of experiments, human coronary artery endothelial cells (HCAEC) were treated with CRP at clinically relevant concentrations (5-25g/mL). C-Reactive protein significantly increased COX-1 and COX-2 levels in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. In addition, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) were activated in CRP (5, 10, 25g/mL)-treated HCAEC cultures. Furthermore, the ERK inhibitor pd98059 (30mol/L) and the JNK inhibitor sp600125 (10mol/L) blocked CRP-induced COX-1 and COX-2 expression for 12h. Together, the findings of the present study suggest that CRP can promote the development of the no-reflow phenomenon by increasing COX-1 and COX-2 expression, which is regulated, in part, via ERK and JNK activity.

While object-level saliency has been recently suggested by psychophysics experiments and shown effective with a few computational models, the spatial relationship between the objects has not yet been explored in this context. We in this work for the first time explicitly model such spatial relationship, as well as leveraging semantic information of an image to enhance object-level saliency modeling. The core computational module is a graphlet-based (i.e., graphlets are moderate-sized connected subgraphs) deep architecture, which hierarchically learns a saliency map from raw image pixels to object-level graphlets (oGLs) and further to spatial-level graphlets (sGLs). Eye tracking data are also used to leverage human experience in saliency prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed oGLs and sGLs well capture object-level and spatial-level cues relating to saliency, and the resulting saliency model performs competitively compared with the state-of-the-art.

However, the molecular mechanism underlying macrophage functional shaping remains largely unknown. In this study, we reveal a pivotal role of miR-127 in macrophage development and thereby the pathogenesis of inflammation and lung injury. In particular, miR-127 was demonstrated to be prominently induced upon TLR engagement and repressed by the M2-prone cytokines. Enforced expression of miR-127 in macrophages resulted in significantly increased production of proinflammatory cytokines, whereas deletion of miR-127 impaired M1 gene expression and led to a M2-biased response. Accordingly, intratracheal administration of miR-127 resulted in an exaggerated pulmonary inflammation and injury. Conversely, antagonizing of miR-127 suppressed production of the proinflammatory cytokines and rendered the mice more refractory to the inflammation-associated pathology. Mechanistically, miR-127 demonstrated to target B cell lymphoma 6 (Bcl6) and remarkably downregulated its expression and subsequently dual specificity phosphatase 1 (Dusp1), which in turn enhanced the activation of JNK kinase and hence the development of proinflammatory macrophages. Thereby, reconstitution with the expression of Bcl6 or Dusp1 or inhibition of JNK activity impaired miR-127-mediated skewing of M1 proinflammatory macrophages, whereas interference of Bcl6 or Dusp1 expression abrogated the anti-inflammatory property of anti-miR-127. Together, these data establish miR-127 as a molecular switch during macrophage development and as a potential target for treatment of inflammatory diseases.

The excess molar volume, partial excess volume at infinite dilution, isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion, excess refraction indices, Lorentz-Lorenz molar refraction and the deviation in molar refraction have been calculated using this data. The results have been incorporated into the Redlich-Kister equation and used to estimate the binary interaction parameters and standard deviation. The values of partial excess volume at infinite dilution and excess refraction indices for the four binary systems at different temperatures were calculated using the adjustable parameters of the Redlich-Kister smoothing equation. The factors that affect these excess quantities are discussed. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, existing CSC algorithms are inefficient in handling moderate and large datasets. In this paper, we aim to develop a scalable and efficient CSC algorithm by integrating sparse coding based graph construction into a framework called constrained normalized cuts. To this end, we formulate a scalable constrained normalized-cuts problem and solve it based on a closed-form mathematical analysis. We demonstrate that this problem can be reduced to a generalized eigenvalue problem that can be solved very efficiently. We also describe a principled k-way CSC algorithm for handling moderate and large datasets. Experimental results over benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is greatly cost-effective, in the sense that (1) with less side information, it can obtain significant improvements in accuracy compared to the unsupervised baseline; (2) with less computational time, it can achieve high clustering accuracies close to those of the state-of-the-art.

J	Xu, QJ; Chang, CH				Xu, Qing-Jun; Chang, Chao-Hsi			Suggestion for measuring the weak dipole moment of tau lepton at Z factory	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							CP VIOLATION; SEARCH; POLARIZATION; INVARIANCE; LIMIT	Three new observables for Z factory to measure the weak dipole moment of tau lepton (d(w)(tau)) are proposed. As those observables are employed at LEP-I, the new observables depend on the real and imaginary parts of d(w)(tau) linearly; thus, we calculate the slopes, i.e., the linear coefficients of the dependence, precisely and find that the obtained slopes are much lager than those employed at LEP-I. It means that the signal for the weak dipole moment d(w)(tau) may be enhanced quite a lot if one employs the new observables. Being superior to those at LEP-I, we recommend measuring the weak dipole moment d(w)(tau) in terms of the new observables if reanalyzing the data of LEP-I or doing the measurement at a possible Z factory in the near future.

Addition of 0.01 mM tetrabutyl ammonium hydroxide (TBAH) as the ion-pairing reagent into the electrophoretic buffer resulted in the complete separation of four iodine species (I-, IO3-, mono-iodothyrosine-MIT and di-iodothyrosine-DIT), because of the electrostatic interaction between TBAH and the negatively charged analytes. A +16 kV separation voltage was applied along the separation capillary (50 mu m i.d., 80 cm total and 60 cm effective) with the inlet grounded. The detection wavelength was fixed at 210 nm, and the pressure-driven flow rate was set at 0.12 mL min(-1) with an injected volume of 2 mu L. The optimal electrolyte consisted of 2 mM borate, 2 mM TBAH and 80% methanol with pH adjusted to 8.5. Baseline separation of iodine species was achieved within 7 min. The detection limits for I-, IO3-, MIT and DIT were 0.052, 0.040, 0.032 and 0.025 mg L-1, respectively. The relative standard deviations of peak heights and areas were all below 3% for 5 mg L-1 and 5% for 1 mg L-1. Application of the proposed method was demonstrated by speciation analysis of iodine in two seaweed samples. The developed method offered satisfactory recoveries in the 91-99% range and good precisions (<5%). Good agreement between the determined values by the proposed CE method and the HPLC-ICP-MS method was also obtained. All results proved its great potential in routine analysis of iodine speciation in environmental, food and biological samples. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Unusual structural and electronic properties of porous silicene and germanene: insights from first-principles calculations	NANOSCALE RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Si/Ge nanosheet; Tunable bandgap; Solar energy application	TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS; CARRIER MOBILITY; DONOR MATERIALS; DESIGN RULES; SOLAR-CELLS; GRAPHDIYNE; GRAPHYNE; GRAPHENE; NANORIBBONS	Using first-principles calculations, we investigate the geometric structures and electronic properties of porous silicene and germanene nanosheets, which are the Si and Ge analogues of alpha-graphyne (referred to as silicyne and germanyne). It is found that the elemental silicyne and germanyne sheets are energetically unfavourable. However, after the C-substitution, the hybrid graphyne-like sheets (c-silicyne/c-germanyne) possess robust energetic and dynamical stabilities. Different from silicene and germanene, c-silicyne is a flat sheet, and c-germanyne is buckled with a distinct half-hilled conformation. Such asymmetric buckling structure causes the semiconducting behaviour into c-germanyne. While in c-silicyne, the semimetallic Dirac-like property is kept at the nonmagnetic state, but a spontaneous antiferromagnetism produces the massive Dirac fermions and opens a sizeable gap between Dirac cones. A tensile strain can further enhance the antiferromagnetism, which also linearly modulates the gap value without altering the direct-bandgap feature. Through strain engineering, c-silicyne can form a type-II band alignment with the MoS2 sheet. The combined c-silicyne/MoS2 nanostructure has a high power conversion efficiency beyond 20% for photovoltaic solar cells, enabling a fascinating utilization in the fields of solar energy and nano-devices.

How the varied emotional states of BD I and II are related to the comorbid personality disorders remains to be settled. Methods We therefore administered the Plutchick - van Praag Depression Inventory (PVP), the Mood Disorder Questionnaire (MDQ), the Hypomanic Checklist-32 (HCL-32), and the Parker Personality Measure (PERM) in 37 patients with BD I, 34 BD II, and in 76 healthy volunteers. Results Compared to the healthy volunteers, patients with BD I and II scored higher on some PERM styles, PVP, MDQ and HCL-32 scales. In BD I, the PERM Borderline style predicted the PVP scale; and Antisocial predicted HCL-32. In BD II, Borderline, Dependant, Paranoid (-) and Schizoid (-) predicted PVP; Borderline predicted MDQ; Passive-Aggressive and Schizoid (-) predicted HCL-32. In controls, Borderline and Narcissistic (-) predicted PVP; Borderline and Dependant (-) predicted MDQ. Conclusion Besides confirming the different predictability of the 11 functioning styles of personality disorder to BD I and II, we found that the prediction was more common in BD II, which might underlie its higher risk of suicide and poorer treatment outcome.

However, most of the imputations have been run using HapMap samples as reference, imputation of low frequency and rare variants (minor allele frequency (MAF) < 5%) are not systemically assessed. With the emergence of next-generation sequencing, large reference panels (such as the 1000 Genomes panel) are available to facilitate imputation of these variants. Therefore, in order to estimate the performance of low frequency and rare variants imputation, we imputed 153 individuals, each of whom had 3 different genotype array data including 317k, 610k and 1 million SNPs, to three different reference panels: the 1000 Genomes pilot March 2010 release (1KGpilot), the 1000 Genomes interim August 2010 release (1KGinterim), and the 1000 Genomes phase1 November 2010 and May 2011 release (1KGphase1) by using IMPUTE version 2. The differences between these three releases of the 1000 Genomes data are the sample size, ancestry diversity, number of variants and their frequency spectrum. We found that both reference panel and GWAS chip density affect the imputation of low frequency and rare variants. 1KGphase1 outperformed the other 2 panels, at higher concordance rate, higher proportion of wellimputed variants (info>0.4) and higher mean info score in each MAF bin. Similarly, 1M chip array outperformed 610K and 317K. However for very rare variants (MAF <= 0.3%), only 0-1% of the variants were well imputed. We conclude that the imputation of low frequency and rare variants improves with larger reference panels and higher density of genome-wide genotyping arrays. Yet, despite a large reference panel size and dense genotyping density, very rare variants remain difficult to impute.

In this article, we review a broad spectrum of multi-agent models of competition (El Farol Bar problem, Minority Game, Kolkata Paise Restaurant problem, Stable marriage problem, Parking space problem and others) and the methods used to understand them analytically. We emphasize the power of concepts and tools from statistical mechanics to understand and explain fully collective phenomena such as phase transitions and long memory, and the mapping between agent heterogeneity and physical disorder. As these methods can be applied to any large-scale model of competitive resource allocation made up of heterogeneous adaptive agent with non-linear interaction, they provide a prospective unifying paradigm for many scientific disciplines.

METHODS: From January 2010 to July 2012, 66452 patients with suspected Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection from 26 hospitals in Zhejiang and Jiangsu Provinces in China underwent gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gastric mucosal biopsies were taken from the antrum for culture. These biopsies were transported under natural environmental temperature to the central laboratory in Hangzhou city and divided into three groups based on their transport time: 5, 24 and 48 h. The culture results were reported after 72 h and the positive culture rates were analyzed by a chi(2) test. An additional 5736 biopsies from H. pylori-positive patients (5646 rapid urease test-positive and 90 C-14-urease breath test-positive) were also cultured for quality control in the central laboratory setting. RESULTS: The positive culture rate was 31.66% (21036/66452) for the patient samples and 71.72% (4114/5736) for the H. pylori-positive quality control specimens. In the 5 h transport group, the positive culture rate was 30.99% (3865/12471), and 32.84% (14960/45553) in the 24 h transport group. In contrast, the positive culture rate declined significantly in the 48 h transport group (26.25%; P < 0.001). During transportation, the average natural temperature increased from 4.67 to 29.14 degrees C, while the positive culture rate declined from 36.67% (1462/3987) to 24.12% (1799/7459). When the temperature exceeded 24., the positive culture rate decreased significantly, especially in the 48 h transport group (23.17%). CONCLUSION: Transportation of specimens within 24 h and below 24. is reasonable and acceptable for centralized culture of multicenter H. pylori samples. et	[Gong, Ya-Nan; Zhang, Jian-Zhong] Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China; [Gong, Ya-Nan; Zhang, Jian-Zhong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Diag & Treatment Infect Di, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, You-Ming] Zhejiang Univ, Affiliated Hosp 1, Coll Med, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Yang, Ning-Min] Zhiyuan Med Inspect Inst Co Ltd, Hangzhou 310021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Li, Hong-Zhang] Sanmen Peoples Hosp, Taizhou 317100, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Guo, Feng] First Peoples Hosp Xiaoshan, Hangzhou 311200, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Lin, Lang] First Peoples Hosp Cangnan, Wenzhou 325800, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Qun-Ying] Jinhua Municipal Cent Hosp, Jinhua 321001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Jia-Kun] First Peoples Hosp Pingyang, Wenzhou 325400, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ji, Zi-Zhong] First Hosp Jiaxing, Jiaxing 314001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mao, Ji-Bo] Zhoushan Hosp, Zhoushan 316021, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Mao, Jun-Liang] First Peoples Hosp Wenling, Wenling 317500, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Shi, Zheng-Chao] Ruian Peoples Hosp, Ruian 325200, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tang, Wu-Heng] Maternal & Child Hlth Hosp Zhoushan City, Zhoushan 316000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhu, Xin-Jian] Shangyu Peoples Hosp, Shaoxing 312300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Shao, Wei] Peoples Hosp, Zhoushan 316399, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Zhang, Xiao-Feng] Hangzhou First Peoples Hosp, Hangzhou 310006, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Xing-Hua] Qingtian Peoples Hosp, Lishui 323900, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tong, Yue-Feng] First Peoples Hosp Yongkang, Yongkang 321300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Mi-Zu] Zhejiang Univ, Childrens Hosp, Sch Med, Hangzhou 310003, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Guang-Lan] Lishui Peoples Hosp, Lishui 323000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhi-Yong] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Affiliated Hosp, Hangzhou 310015, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Tu, Hui-Min] Suzhou Univ, Hosp Affiliated, Wuxi 214062, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jiang, Guo-Fa] Jinhua Wenrong Hosp, Jinhua 321001, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wu, Jian-Sheng] First Affiliated Hosp, Wenzhou Med Coll, Wenzhou 325000, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Chen, Xu-Peng] Yueqing Peoples Hosp, Wenzhou 325600, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ding, Qiu-Long] Tiantai Peoples Hosp, Taizhou 317200, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Ouyang, Hong] Linan Peoples Hosp, Linan 311300, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Jin, Feng-Zhe] Ruian City TCM Hosp, Ruian 325200, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Xu, Yan-Li] Hebei Univ Engn, Coll Med, Handan 056038, Herts, Peoples R China	Zhang, JZ (reprint author), Chinese Ctr Dis Control & Prevent, Natl Inst Communicable Dis Control & Prevent, State Key Lab Infect Dis Prevent & Control, 155 Changbai Rd, Beijing 102206, Peoples R China.	zhangjianzhong@icdc.cn		Ma, Han/0000-0001-9985-3035	Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province China [2001C23140]; National Technology RD Program in the 12th Five-Year Plan of China [2012BAI06B02]; Major Technology Project as part of "Prevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases including AIDS and Viral Hepatitis" [2013ZX10004216-002]; National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Project [2012YQ180117]; Medical and Health Science and Technology Plan Project of Zhejiang Province [2012KYB248]; Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang province [2011C23140]	Supported by Grants from the Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province China, No. 2001C23140, National Technology RD Program in the 12th Five-Year Plan of China, No. 2012BAI06B02, the Major Technology Project as part of "Prevention and Control of Major Infectious Diseases including AIDS and Viral Hepatitis", No. 2013ZX10004216-002, the National Key Scientific Instrument and Equipment Development Project, No. 2012YQ180117, the Medical and Health Science and Technology Plan Project of Zhejiang Province, No. 2012KYB248, and the Science and Technology Project of Zhejiang province, No. 2011C23140.		30	4	4	1	4	BAISHIDENG PUBLISHING GROUP INC	PLEASANTON	8226 REGENCY DR, PLEASANTON, CA 94588 USA	1007-9327	2219-2840		WORLD J GASTROENTERO	World J.

It is found that Sr0.5Ce0.5FBiS2 undergoes a second-order transition below similar to 7.5 K, followed by a superconducting transition with the critical temperature T-c similar to 2.8 K. Our transport, specific heat, and dc-magnetization results suggest the presence of bulk ferromagnetic correlation of Ce ions below 7.5 K that coexist with superconductivity when the temperature is further lowered below 2.8 K.

However no miRNA has been experimentally documented to be functionally involved in fruit ripening although many miRNAs have been profiled in fruits. Here we show that SlymiR157 and SlymiR156 differentially modulate ripening and softening in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). SlymiR157 is expressed and developmentally regulated in normal tomato fruits and in those of the Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) epimutant. It regulates expression of the key ripening gene LeSPL-CNR in a likely dose-dependent manner through miRNA-induced mRNA degradation and translation repression. Viral delivery of either pre-SlymiR157 or mature SlymiR157 results in delayed ripening. Furthermore, qRT-PCR profiling of key ripening regulatory genes indicates that the SlymiR157-target LeSPL-CNR may affect expression of LeMADS-RIN, LeHB1, SlAP2a and SlTAGL1. However SlymiR156 does not affect the onset of ripening, but it impacts fruit softening after the red ripe stage. Our findings reveal that working together with a ripening network of transcription factors, SlymiR157 and SlymiR156 form a critical additional layer of regulatory control over the fruit ripening process in tomato.

The protonated molecules underwent dissociation reactions, upon collisional activation, to give the [tosyl cation/aniline] ion-neutral complex (INC), in which the coupling reactions subsequently occurred to afford an ionic species of toluenesulfinate. The subsequent reactions of the toluenesulfinate species resulted in generation of the protonated 6-iminocyclohexa- 2,4-dienone or the 2-aminophenol radical cation, via cleavage of the S-O bond. The above processes involved the tosyl oxygen transfer, and calculation results indicated that both the ortho- and the para- positions at the aniline ring are favorite for the tosyl oxygen transfer, and formation of radical cation involved an INC mediated electron transfer. The isomeric N-methylphenyl p-toluenesulfonamides behaved significant difference in the CID-MS spectra, indicating that the three isomers can be distinguished by ESI-MS. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, we employed a simple, yet versatile hydrogen bonding directed supramolecular assembly (HBSA) strategy to control the localization of Au NPs from the center to the interface in polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P4VP) cylindrical micellar aggregates by tailoring the selectivity of polymer brushes on the surface of Au NPs. PS-b-P4VP(PDP)(x) combcoil supramolecules were constructed by PS-b-P4VP and n-pentadecylphenol (PDP) via the hydrogen bonding between the pyridine of P4VP and the hydroxyl of PDP. PS-tethered Au NPs (PS-Au NPs) were selectively localized in the PS domain while a binary mixture of PS and P4VP-tethered Au NPs (PS/P4VP-Au NPs) were adsorbed to the interface between PS and P4VP(PDP)x domains presumably due to the redistribution of PS and P4VP ligands on the Au NPs surface, triggering the formation of amphiphilic surfactant-like NPs. Isolated cylindrical micellar aggregates with controlled localization of Au NPs were obtained by the selective disassembly of the supramolecules. Moreover, supramolecular block domain size, composition of the supramolecules, size of the Au NPs, and volume fraction of the Au NPs were carefully investigated to reveal their effects on the morphology of hybrid micellar aggregates and localization of NPs. These hybrid micellar aggregates with controlled localization and loading efficiency of Au NPs may extend the applications of the hybrid micellar aggregates and find more potential uses in optical/electronic devices, catalysis, and drug delivery system.

Concurrent signature without random oracles	THEORETICAL COMPUTER SCIENCE			English	Article						Concurrent signature; Fair exchange; Ambiguity; Anonymity; Accountability; Provable security; Multi-user setting	OPTIMISTIC FAIR EXCHANGE; UNDENIABLE SIGNATURES; DIGITAL-SIGNATURES; BILINEAR MAPS; CONSTRUCTION; CERTIFICATE; COLLISIONS; MD5	A concurrent signature provides an efficient way to exchange digital signatures between parties in a fair manner. Since its introduction in Eurocrypt 2004, removing the random oracle heuristic in the security analysis of a concurrent signature scheme has become an open problem, and the security of all the existing provably secure schemes could have only been done in the random oracle model, while it has been known that the security in the random oracle model may not be guaranteed when the underlying random oracles are replaced by real-life hash functions. In this paper, we solve this open problem by proposing a new concurrent signature scheme, which allows us to prove its security without random oracles. The security model we consider in this paper also slightly differs from previous works. Signatures before revealing the keystone are strongly ambiguous (or anonymous) in the sense that everyone is able to produce signatures that are indistinguishable from those generated honestly by the parties involved in the exchange, while signatures after revealing the keystone remain unforgeable without sacrificing the fairness property. In the multi-user setting and without random oracles, we prove the security of our scheme based on the intractability of Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem and collision resistance of hash functions.

The five emission features alpha, beta, gamma, delta, and epsilon originating from the CuPc molecules locate at 1.48, 3.66, 4.98, 6.90, and 9.04 eV, respectively. These features shift in binding energy with the increasing CuPc coverage. The feature alpha is mostly deriving from Cu 3d orbital with some contributions from C 2p orbital. Further theoretical calculation indicates that the adsorption of CuPc on a top site is the most favorable configuration, and the separation between the adsorbate and graphene is about 3.47A angstrom. According to the density of states before and after CuPc adsorption, the LUMO of CuPc is slightly occupied, while the Dirac point of graphene slightly shift towards higher energy, suggesting that a small amount of electron transfer from graphene to CuPc upon contact.

While the stoichiometric CuCl2/base persistently gave the C5-monochlorination, the Pd(II)-catalyzed chlorination by using N-chlorosuccinimide (NCS) as a chlorine source led to variable results mainly relying on the substitution pattern of the 8-acylaminoquinolines and the loading of NCS. This work demonstrated not only an unprecedented access to divergently halogenated quinolines, but also a less studied C(sp(2))-H functionalization mode, namely the single-electron transfer (SET) mediated C(sp(2))-H functionalization.

Here, we described the complementary annealing mediated by exonuclease (CAME), in which the insert or vector fragment is amplified to carry sequences complementary to the other, and both fragments are modified by exonuleases to create directional single-stranded overhangs. The two recessed DNA fragments are joined through complementary strand annealing. The CAME is highly efficient for cloning the DNA of at least 12kb and single DNA fragment out of a complex DNA sample. Moreover, the application of CAME greatly improved the efficiency of site-directed mutagenesis.

The animals were divided into four groups, i.e. the control (C), low-dose PMO-treated (DPT, 100mg/kg), moderatedose PMO-treated (MPT, 200 mg/kg) and high-dose PMO-treated (HPT, 400 mg/kg) groups. PMO were administered orally by gavag once a day for 28 days. After 28 days, the mice performed an exhaustive swimming exercise and the livers were collected to measure malondialdehyde (MDA) levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), glutathione peroxidase (GPx), xanthine oxidase (XO) and reduced glutathione (GSH) activities. The data obtained showed that MDA levels were significantly lower in the DPT, MPT and HPT groups than those in the C group (P < 0.05). SOD, GPx and GSH activities were significantly higher in the DPT, MPT and HPT groups than those in the C group (P < 0.05). CAT activities were significantly higher in the MPT and HPT groups than those in the C group (P < 0.05). XO activities were significantly lower in the MPT and HPT groups than those in the C group (P < 0.05). The results revealed that PMO can effectively attenuate the exhaustive exercise-induced oxidative stress in liver.

Gingipains were isolated and purified from the supernatant of P. gingivalis W83, which was cultured under standard anaerobic conditions; primary RASMCs were also cultured. RASMCs were exposed to 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, 6, 3, 1, and 0 mu g/mL activated gingipains and the proliferation was evaluated using a cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay after 48 h. alpha-Smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and osteopontin (OPN) expression were measured by immunohistochemical staining. In addition, RASMCs were stimulated with 5, 10, 20, and 40 mu M KYT-1 (arg-gingipain inhibitor) and KYT-36 (lys-gingipain inhibitor) in combination with the gingipain extracts. Different concentrations of gingipains significantly promoted the proliferation of RASMCs, except those treated with 1 mu g/mL, compared to the untreated controls. The proliferation was sustained at a concentration above 12 mu g/mL. Immunohistochemical staining showed OPN expression after gingipain stimulation. The proliferative effects of gingipains on RASMCs were blocked after treatment with 10 mu M KYT-1 or 10 mu M KYT-36 (P < 0.0001); however, the difference between KYT-1 and KYT-36 groups was not statistically significant. These results demonstrated that gingipains can promote phenotypic transformation and proliferation of RASMCs and their effects were blocked by KYT-1 and KYT-36, which help us to ascertain whether Rgp or Kgp contributes to the development of atherosclerosis.

J	Zhang, J; Ye, WQ; Fan, F				Zhang, Ju; Ye, Wenqin; Fan, Fan			Development of a self-assessment tool for measuring competences of obstetric nurses in rooming-in wards in China	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CLINICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL MEDICINE			English	Article						Competency assessment; competency-based education/organization & administration; educational measurement; obstetric nurse; rooming-in ward nurse	PERFORMANCE; EDUCATION	Introduction: To provide high-quality nursing care, a reliable and feasible competency assessment tool is critical. Although several questionnaire-based competency assessment tools have been reported, a tool specific for obstetric nurses in rooming-in wards is lacking. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to develop a competency assessment tool for obstetric rooming-in ward nurses. Methods: A literature review was conducted to create an individual intensive interview with 14 nurse managers, educators, and primary nurses in rooming-in wards. Expert reviews (n = 15) were conducted to identify emergent themes in a Delphi fashion. A competency assessment questionnaire was then developed and tested with 246 rooming-in ward nurses in local hospitals. Results: We constructed a three-factor linear model for obstetric rooming-in nurse competency assessment. Further refinement resulted in a self-assessment questionnaire containing three first-tier, 12 second-tier, and 43 third-tier items for easy implementation. The questionnaire was reliable, contained satisfactory content, and had construct validity. Discussion: Our competency assessment tool provides a systematic, easy, and operational subjective evaluation model for nursing managers and administrators to evaluate obstetric rooming-in ward primary nurses. The application of this tool will facilitate various human resources functions, such as nurse training/education effect evaluation, and will eventually promote high-quality nursing care delivery.

Genomics, or whole genome approach, has become the most comprehensive investigative method to identify new gene mutations, signal pathways and drug targets for cancers. The purpose of this review is to summarize current second generation sequencing techniques in applied genomics, and to analyze the advantages and/or problems associated with each of the various sequencing platforms. Our understanding of molecular factors associated with tumorigenesis is no longer limited to the mutation of well-known cancer related genes, but may involve a broader range of factors involved in tumor development, including novel somatic mutations, gene fusions, long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs, copy number variations, methylation, and genomic structural variations. Furthermore, these new methods are not limited to analyses of single genetic or epigenetic factor, but offer comprehensive molecule profiling as a more critical and powerful approach to decoding the mystery of tumor development and identifying more reliable cancer biomarkers.

Both telomere length and hypertension risk can be modified by certain dietary factors, such as fruit and vegetables. This study was to examine the potential effect of these dietary factors on the association between telomere length and hypertension risk. Study design: A community-based case-control study. Participants: 271 hypertensive patients and 455 normotensive controls aged 40-70 years and living in Yinzhou, Zhejiang Province, China. Outcome measures: Peripheral leucocyte relative telomere length (RTL) was measured using quantitative real-time PCR. Dietary intake was assessed by a brief semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. The association between RTL and hypertension risk was analysed using logistic regression, and the modulatory effect of dietary intake on RTL-related hypertension risk was analysed using likelihood ratio tests. Results: Among controls, longer age-adjusted RTL was associated with higher vegetable intake (p = 0.01). Individuals with longer age-adjusted RTL (based on median value) were 30% less likely to have hypertension (OR = 0.70, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.96; p = 0.03). The observed RTL-hypertension relationship appeared to be modified by vegetable intake-longer RTL was significantly associated with lower hypertension risk only in those with greater vegetable consumption (OR = 0.28, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.57; p < 0.001), but not in those with lower vegetable intake (P-interaction = 0.008). Conclusions: Certain dietary factors might modify telomere-related hypertension risk.

SEE APRIL; GROWTH-FACTOR; MMP9 ACTIVATION; INHIBITION; IDH2; METASTASIS; EXPRESSION; MUTATIONS; APOPTOSIS	Background/Aims: Isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2) is a mitochondrial NADP-dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, and has been found to be a tumor suppressor in several types of tumors. However, the roles of IDH2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as well as underlying mechanisms remain unknown. Methods: The IDH2 and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP9) levels in the specimens from 24 HCC patients were investigated by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. Their relationship was examined by correlation analyses. Patient survival with high IDH2 levels and low IDH2 levels was compared. IDH2 levels and MMP9 levels were modified in a human HCC cell line. The effects of IDH2 or MMP9 modulation on the expression of the other were analyzed. The effects of IDH2 on cell invasion were analyzed in a transwell cell invasion assay. The dependence of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) signaling was examined using a specific inhibitor. Results: The IDH2 levels significantly decreased in HCC, and were lower in HCC with metastases, compared to those without metastases. IDH2 levels inversely correlated with MMP9 levels in HCC. HCC patients with Low IDH2 had lower 5-year survival. MMP9 levels did not regulate IDH2 levels, while IDH2 inhibited MMP9 levels in HCC cells, in a NF-kappa B signaling dependent manner, possibly through i kappa B, to suppress HCC cell invasion. Conclusions: Down regulation of IDH2 may promote HCC cell invasion via NF-kappa B-dependent increases in MMP9 activity. IDH2 may be a potential therapeutic target for HCC.

Study design: In the present study, a novel genotyping method for detecting 30 HPV genotypes, specifically by genotyping both the HPV E6 and L1 genes with multiplex PCR using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) (PCR-MS) was first adopted to evaluate HPV genotypes in 89 esophageal cancer samples and 49 matched adjacent normal esophageal tissues. Results: Six HPV genotypes (HPV6, HPV16, HPV33, HPV39, HPV51, and HPV82) were present in at least 51.7% of the esophageal carcinoma tissues, which was significantly greater than 28.6% prevalence among controls (P < 0.05). HPV16 was the most common of all the genotypes investigated (HPV16 prevalence in carcinoma tissue: 49.4%; odds ratio 3.02, 95% confidence interval 1.39-6.53). HPV-positive ESCC patients were generally younger than HPV-negative patients (P = 0.04). In addition, HPV infection was more common in cases of well-differentiated and shallower invasive depth. Conclusions: Based on this new detection method, our findings reiterate the possibility that HPV infection (especially HPV16) may be involved in the etiology of esophageal carcinoma in the Kazakh populations and that HPV E6 gene positivity may be associated with prognosis of patients.

It can occur in nearly every part of the body. Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor (IMT) is a rare neoplasm mostly seen in the lungs, but also in extrapulmonary sites. But it may rarely be seen in the vical cord. We report a case of a 73-year-old men presented with hoarseness and cough. Laryngoscopy reveals a large non-ulcerated, red subepithelial mass arising from the right vical cord. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a mass in the right vical cord, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) enhanced scan showed the mass of the right vical cord inhomogeneous enhancement. The patient underwent right cordectomy with KTP laser, and further assessment of the tissue demonstrated a pathologic diagnosis of IMT.

To investigate this in turtles, we acclimated juvenile Chinese three-keeled pond turtles, Chinemys reevesii, under three thermal conditions for four weeks. Subsequently, we measured three locomotor performances (swimming, running, and righting) at different test temperatures. Overall, swimming and running speeds of turtles increased with increasing test temperature in the range of 13-33 degrees C and decreased at higher test temperatures, whereas righting time decreased with increasing test temperature in the range of 13-33 degrees C and slightly increased at higher test temperatures. Acclimation temperature affected both swimming and running speeds, with the high temperature-acclimated turtles swimming and running faster than low temperature-acclimated turtles, but it did not affect righting performance. From the constructed thermal performance curves, between-group differences were found in the estimated maximal speed (swimming and running) and optimal temperature, but not in the performance breadth. Juvenile turtles acclimated to relatively warm temperatures had better performances than those acclimated to cool temperatures, supporting the "hotter is better" hypothesis. A similar acclimatory change was found during aquatic and terrestrial locomotion in juvenile C. reevesii. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that animals from less thermally variable environments should have a greater acclimatory ability than those from more variable environments, because turtles were acclimated under aquatic environments with no thermal variability.

Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered one of the most effective and fast-acting treatment options for depressive episodes. Little is known, however, about ECT's enabling brain (neuro)plasticity effects, particular for plasticity of white matter pathway. Materials and Methods. We collected longitudinal diffusion tensor imaging in the first-episode, drug-naive major depressive disorder (MDD) patients (n = 24) before and after a predefined time window ECT treatment. We constructed large-scale anatomical networks derived from white matter fiber tractography and evaluated the topological reorganization using graph theoretical analysis. We also assessed the relationship between topological reorganization with improvements in depressive symptoms. Results. Our investigation revealed three main findings: (1) the small-worldness was persistent after ECT series; (2) anatomical connections changes were found in limbic structure, temporal and frontal lobes, in which the connection changes between amygdala and parahippocampus correlate with depressive symptom reduction; (3) significant nodal strength changes were found in right paralimbic network. Conclusions. ECT elicits neuroplastic processes associated with improvements in depressive symptoms that act to specific local ventral frontolimbic circuits, but not small-world property. Overall, ECT induced topological reorganization in large-scale brain structural network, opening up new avenues to better understand the mode of ECT action in MDD.

Their optical properties are described based on UV-Vis absorption and both steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectroscopy. DFT and TD-DFT calculations are also presented to support experimental data. The difluoroboron complexes 1a and 2a display moderate fluorescence quantum yields both in aprotic solvents with different polarity and in the solid-state. Replacement of the fluoride group with the phenyl group at the boron atom to form 1b and 2b results in efficient nonradiative decay of the S-1 state and hence a drastic decrease in fluorescence intensity. The maximum emission wavelength (lambda(em)) and fluorescence lifetime (tau(F)) of 2a incorporating a phenyl-substituent at the isoindonyl moiety are found to be very sensitive to the solvent (a bathochromic shift of 82 nm and an 8-fold increase in tau(F) in aprotic polar solvents). The longer emission wavelength in polar solvents compared with that in low-polar solvents is due to the intramolecular charge-transfer (ICT) character of the excited state from the phenyl-isoindolyl unit to the pyridyl unit. The Stokes shift of 2a exhibits a linear increase as a function of the solvent orientation parameter, reaching similar to 7890 cm(-1) in methanol.

Lennard-Jones interactions between polymers and fillers are considered. Results show that the statistical dimensions and dynamical diffusion of polymer are dependent on the polymer-filler interaction strength epf. The mean square radius of gyration < R-G(2)> i shows a minimum at a critical polymer-filler interaction epsilon(pf)*. The value of epsilon(pf)* decreases with the increase in the polymer length or the concentration of fillers. The exponent nu in < R-G(2)> similar to N-2 nu is a typical value of self-avoiding walking chain at small epsilon(pf) but it increases sharply to a bigger value at epsilon(pf) > epsilon(pf)*. The mean square displacement decreases with the increase in epsilon(pf). Moreover, the normal diffusion of the polymer at weak interactions changes to subnormal diffusion at moderate and strong attractions. We find that polymers diffuse in dilute filler regions at weak attraction and diffuse in dense filler regions at strong attraction.

The plasma samples can be extracted with minimal effort by utilizing a simple protein precipitation with acetonitrile. The chromatographic separation was achieved using a C18 column (2.1 x 100 mm, 1.7 mu m). The mobile phase consisted of acetonitrile and water (containing 0.1% formic acid) with gradient elution. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometric detection was performed by using multiple reactions monitoring in positive electrospray ionization. The intra-day and inter-day RSD value were < 14%, and the accuracy ranged from 85.4 to 112.2%. The recoveries were > 64.1% and the matrix effects ranged from 92.4 to 108.2%. The calibration curves in plasma were linear in the range of 2-2000 ng/mL for all analytes with correlation coefficient > 0.993. Effectiveness of this method was validated with pharmacokinetic studies of the dasatinib and sorafenib in rat plasma.

We formulated a hypothesis that the mean number of syllables per word type in texts or speeches by writers and speakers has a certain pattern or regularity. This work reports the distribution of the mean number of syllables per word from all available electronic books at the Project Gutenberg's Web site. We used three dictionaries and built a rule-based algorithm to compute the mean number of syllables per word type in each e-book and observed the distribution of the words with the largest number of syllables in those books. A linear equation between the length of word type and the word's number of syllables was proposed through regression analysis.

J	Ding, Y; Wang, YL				Ding, Yi; Wang, Yanli			Hydrogen-induced stabilization and tunable electronic structures of penta-silicene: a computational study	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; 2D MATERIALS; GRAPHENE; SEMICONDUCTORS; ROADMAP	Using first-principles calculations, we have systematically investigated the structural stability and electronic properties of penta-silicene nanosheets, which are the Si analogues of recently proposed penta-graphene [S. Zhang et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 2015, 112, 2372]. We find that unlike penta-graphene, the pristine penta-silicene sheet has soft modes from the unfavourable high-buckled configuration for tricoordinated Si atoms. The dynamic stability of penta-silicene is restored by surface hydrogen decoration, which also gives it good energetic and mechanical stability. The hydrogenated penta-silicene (p-SiH) sheet is a soft material with superior flexibility, which can endure large biaxial and uniaxial strains up to 25% and 31%, respectively. The two-dimensional p-SiH nanosheet is an indirect-band-gap semiconductor, while for one-dimensional nanoribbons, the edge states induce flat bands at the Fermi level, causing a spontaneous spin-polarization in the system. In narrow nanoribbons, the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state is more favorable than the ferromagnetic (FM) one, while they become degenerate in wide nanoribbons. More interestingly, the FM p-SiH nanoribbons are bipolar magnetic semiconductors that can be altered to half-metals with opposite conducting spin channels by p-type and n-type doping. Our study demonstrates that the hydrogenated penta-silicene possesses robust structural stabilities and promising mechanical and electronic properties, which gives the Si-based nanostructure many potential applications in future nanodevices.

In this paper, hydrogen production by non-catalytic partial oxidation of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater was systematically investigated in supercritical water (SCW) with a continuous reactor for the first time. The influences of the main operating parameters including residence time, temperature and oxidant equivalent ratio (ER) on the gasification characteristics of analgin pharmaceutical wastewater were investigated. The experimental results showed that H-2 yield and carbon gasification efficiency (CE) increased with increasing temperature. CE increased with increasing ER, and H2 yield peaked when ER equaled 0.2. CE increased quickly within 180 s and then tended to be stable between 240 and 300 s.

Depression is a common psychiatric disorder occurring in people across the lifespan. Accumulating evidence indicates that depression may be a prodrome and/or a "risk factor" for AD. However, whether AD and depression share a common pathophysiological pathway is still unclear. The aim of this study was to identify regional alterations in brain function associated with depressive symptoms in mild AD patients. Thirty-two mild AD patients were evaluated using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and were divided into two groups: 15 AD patients with depressive symptoms (D-AD) and 17 non-depressed AD (nD-AD) patients. Using the approach of regional homogeneity (ReHo), we characterized resting-state regional brain activity in D-AD and nD-AD patients. Compared with nD-AD patients, D-AD patients showed decreased ReHo in the right precentral gyrus, right superior frontal gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and right inferior frontal cortex. Our findings show regional brain activity alterations in D-AD patients. Thus, D-AD pathogenesis may be attributed to abnormal neural activity in multiple brain regions.

Then, the Hep-GO was used as a carrier of doxorubicin hydrochloride (DOX) and granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), and a Hep-GO/DOX/G-CSF complex was fabricated. UV-Vis analysis was carried out to study the colloidal stability of Hep-GO in aqueous solution. A thermogravimetric test was used to determine its composition. Then, the loading process, in vitro release behavior, heat stability and cytotoxicity of the Hep-GO/DOX/G-CSF complex were studied. The results showed that the Hep-GO/DOX/G-CSF complex displayed heat stability, long-term drug release property and lower drug cytotoxicity, suggesting the great potential application of Hep-GO as a multifunctional drug delivery system.

Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis to evaluate and compare the sensitivity and specificity of single test of CA19-9, CA242, and CEA, as well as combination test in pancreatic cancer detection. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, Medline, and Wanfang databases for studies that evaluated the diagnostic validity of CA19-9, CA242, and CEA between January 1990 and September 2014. Data were analyzed by Meta-Disc and STATA software. Results: A total of 21 studies including 3497 participants, which fulfilled the inclusion criteria were considered for analysis. The pooled sensitivities for CA19-9, CA242, and CEA were 75.4 (95% CI: 73.4-77.4), 67.8 (95% CI: 65.5-70), and 39.5 (95% CI: 37.3-41.7), respectively. The pooled specificities of CA19-9, CA242, and CEA were 77.6 (95% CI: 75.4-79.7), 83 (95% CI: 81-85), and 81.3 (95% CI: 79.3-83.2), respectively. Parallel combination of CA19-9+ CA242 has a higher sensitivity (89, 95% CI: 80-95) without impairing the specificity (75, 95% CI: 6782). Conclusions: Our meta-analysis showed that CA242 and CA19-9 have better performance in the diagnosis of pancreatic cancer than CEA. Furthermore, parallel combination test of CA19-9+ CA242 could be of better diagnostic value than individual CA242 or CA19-9 test.

A scheme using Extended Service Set-(ESS-) based architecture is presented to implement the proxy mobile IPv6 protocol, that is, PMIPv6, for IEEE 802.11 infrastructure Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs). The key signaling packets together with their time sequences for the mobility management in the proposed scheme are proposed. Moreover, the handoff delay in the proposed scheme is derived, through which the performance of the proposed scheme is analyzed. Numerical analysis indicates that the proposed scheme considerably outperforms the existing scheme that uses the Basic Service Set (BSS) based architecture in terms of handoff delay in the case when the delay between Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) and local mobile anchor (LMA) is relatively large.

The results indicated that most ethyl acetate extracts of fermentation broth of these fungal endophytes had stronger antimicrobial activities than their fermentation broth. Among these endophytic strains, both fermentation broth and the ethyl acetate extract of strain D showed the strongest inhibitory effects on all pathogens. Strains 5-19 and BZ also exhibited potent antibacterial activities. However, other strains had weak or no antimicrobial effect. This was the first report on the isolation and antimicrobial effects of endophytic fungi from E. chrysantha.

J	Li, X; Zang, YF; Zhang, H				Li, Xun; Zang, Yu-Feng; Zhang, Han			Exploring Dynamic Brain Functional Networks Using Continuous "State-Related'' Functional MRI	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; POWER GRIP; FMRI DATA; CONNECTIVITY; FORCE; FEEDBACK	We applied a "temporal decomposition" method, which decomposed a single brain functional network into several "modes"; each of them dominated a short temporal period, on a continuous, "state-" related, "finger-force feedback" functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment. With the hypothesis that attention and internal/external information processing interaction could be manipulated by different (real and sham) feedback conditions, we investigated functional network dynamics of the "default mode," "executive control," and sensorimotor networks. They were decomposed into several modes. During real feedback, the occurrence of "default mode-executive control competition-related" mode was higher than that during sham feedback (P = 0.0003); the " default mode-visual facilitation-related" mode more frequently appeared during sham than real feedback (P = 0.0004). However, the dynamics of the sensorimotor network did not change significantly between two conditions (P > 0.05). Our results indicated that the visual-guided motor feedback involves higher cognitive functional networks rather than primary motor network. The dynamics monitoring of inner and outside environment and multisensory integration could be the mechanisms. This study is an extension of our previous region-specific and static-styled study of our brain functional architecture.

Because these reactions occur at low temperatures of ca. -30 degrees C, initial complexation of the silylene to the carbonyl oxygen of the diazocarbonyl compounds is suggested to trigger dinitrogen elimination followed by cyclization. In contrast, a six-membered cyclic diazo compound 8 and 1-sila-2,3-diazabicyclo[3.3.0]oct-3-ene 10 were obtained in good yields by the reaction of 1 with less reactive ethyl 2-diazo-3-oxo-3-phenylpropanoate 7 and trimethylsilyldiazomethane 9. Molecular structures of 2, 3, 8 and 10 were determined by X-ray crystallography.

Herein we report a green miniemulsion-based technique for preparing polymeric AIE nanoparticles (NPs). A vinyl-containing AIE luminogen, 1-allyl-1-methyl-2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsilole (AMTPS), was incorporated into the NPs through copolymerization with a common monomer, styrene. Spherical AIE NPs with a size of 50-60 nm could emit strong green fluorescence under irradiation with UV light. The photoluminescence (PL) intensity of the AIE NPs could be precisely tuned through the variation of the AMTPS content. The chemical composition, molecular weight, and optical properties of the copolymers were systematically investigated. The molecular weight of the copolymer could be modulated by the AMTPS content. The PL intensity of the copolymers could be significantly enhanced by aggregation formation of the copolymers, displaying a typical AIE property.

The clinical and pathological characteristics of the lesion and a review of the literature are both described. Methods: A descriptive study of a case of invasive CHC occurring in a 60-yr-old woman is presented. Tumor was standard processed and stained by hematoxylin & eosin, PAS, immunohistochemically examined for ER, PR, C-erbB-2, CEA, thyroglobulin, E-cadherin, S-100 protein, and Cytokeratin5/6. Results: The tumor, which was 4.7x3.7x3.0 cm, was localized in the upper region of the left breast. This tumor revealed multiple cystic spaces, which were filled with PAS. It was positive for CEA, ER, E-cadherin, and S-100 protein, but negative for thyroglobulin, PR, and C-erbB-2. Cytokeratin5/6 was expressed in the cystic hypersecretory hyperplasia region, but not in the invasive area. The ten-month follow-up period was uneventful. Conclusions: Cystic hypersecretory carcinoma of the breast is a rare and distinctive variant of ductal carcinoma in situ. It has the potential for invasive growth. As there are few recorded cases, the prognosis in patients with invasive CHC is still uncertain and a matter of intensive debate.

An analytic expression of the irradiance distribution of the focusing partially coherent dark hollow Gaussian beams in the back focal plane has been given by using the Collins formula. The focus shift of focused partially coherent dark hollow Gaussian beams in different parameters is studied in detail by numerical calculations. It is found that the absolute value of the focal shift of partially coherent dark hollow Gaussian beams decreases as the transverse coherence width or the order of the dark hollow Gaussian beams or a parameter of the dark hollow Gaussian beams increases.

The POM components in the ternary nanocomposites crystallize first to form "nano-hybrid shish-kebab (NHSK)'' structures at a high temperature in the presence of MWCNTs, with the simultaneous exclusion of poorly crystallizable PLLA chains into the intra-NHSK regimes. The subsequent PLLA crystallization in the intra-NHSK regimes is also nucleated on the surface of MWCNTs and transforms the final crystal morphology into "ternary-hybrid shish-kebab (THSK)'' superstructures. Therefore, a "binary-polymer-decoration'' of MWCNTs, named "block-assembling'', is achieved. Such a novel "block-assembling'' structure is further used to fabricate conductive nanoporous polymeric materials with a unique interposition structure of CNTs in the inner wall of the internal pores after the removal of the PLLA components in the ternary nanocomposites.

Hormetic responses of food-supplied PCB 31 (2, 4', 5-Trichlorobiphenyl) was studied by using zebrafish (Danio rerio) growth as an end point. The results in general followed the hormesis hypothesis, PCB 31 at lower concentrations (0.042 mu g/g and 0.084 mu g/g) exhibited beneficial effects on the growth of zebrafish by weight and length while higher concentrations (10 mu g/g and 20 mu g/g) revealed inhibitory effects. The magnitude of stimulatory responses of zebrafish growth by weight and length at lower concentrations (0.01-0.084 mu g/g) on days 14 and 21 were in the range 9.09-18.18%; 10-38.09% and 4-14.4%; 6.25-10.93%, respectively as compared to control. Growth and conditions indices also suggested that the zebrafish was healthier at lower concentrations as compared to those at higher concentrations. The results of the present study will elaborate fish toxicological evaluation regarding the hormetic model.

Our simulation results showed that the loading of different ssDNA oligomers into the zigzag SWNT is much easier than for the armchair SWNT. Confined in both zigzag and armchair type SWNTs, ssDNA oligomers have a helical structure and their bases adapt the orientation parallel to the interior wall. From detailed analysis of the interaction energy, potential of mean force (PMF) of the unloading process and nucleotide binding free energy, our results show that the chirality of SWNTs has a large effect on the binding strength of nucleotides, and hence affects the loading dynamics of ssDNA into SWNTs.

Clonal plants can selectively place ramets in resource-rich patches to efficiently use heterogeneously distributed resources by altering spacer performance. Leymus secalinus, with a combination of phalanx and guerilla growth forms, can produce both spreading and clumping ramets. Previous studies have shown that nutrient availability decreases the proportion of spreading ramets. It was hypothesized that L. secalinus could place more ramets in resource-rich patches by producing more clumping ramets. To test this hypothesis, L secalinus was grown under artificial conditions with heterogeneously distributed nutrients and light. Results showed that L. secalinus not only altered the spacer length and specific spacer biomass between spreading ramets, but also balanced the trade-off between phalanx and guerilla growth forms to place more ramets in resource-rich patches, even if the patches were very small. Such multiple adaptations by L. secalinus, together with a division of labor, may enable it to efficiently use heterogeneous resources in natural ecosystems and to subsequently change the localized environment.

Here, we carried out an fMRI study by using a continuous paradigm, that is, continuous (8 min) feedback of finger force. Borrowing an analytic method widely used in resting-state fMRI studies, that is, regional homogeneity (ReHo), we compared the local synchronization in some subfrequency bands between real and sham feedback, and the subbands were defined as Slow-6 (0.0-0.01Hz), Slow-5 (0.01-0.027Hz), Slow-4 (0.027-0.073Hz), Slow-3 (0.073-0.198Hz), and Slow-2 (0.198-0.25Hz). Our results revealed that the five subfrequency bands of brain activity contributed to the changes of ReHo between real and sham feedback differently, and, more importantly, the changes in basal ganglia were only manifested in Slow-6, implicating the fact that ReHo in ultraslow band may be associated with the functional significance of BG, that is, motor control. These findings provide novel insights into the neural substrate underlying motor feedback, and properties of the ultraslow band of local synchronization deserve more attention in future explorations.

In this study, we use molecular dynamics simulation to demonstrate that DNA tends to adsorb on pristine neutralized graphene rather than on graphene with negative charge. This property of graphene could be charge-tuned from DNA-philic to DNA-phobic, and the property is evaluated by the contact angle of DNA absorbed the on graphene surface. With a negative charge, graphene is prone to be DNA-phobic; with a positive charge, or without a charge, it is likely to be DNA-philic. The translocation time of DNA on a graphene nanopore was greatly extended if the graphene nanopore is functionalized by a negative charge. This study could help us to better design a promising device for DNA sequencing by graphene nanopores.

The patients with SSN-PTB have to wait for a longer period of time before receiving proper treatment than sputum smear positive pulmonary TB (SSP-PTB) patients due to delay in diagnosis. The purpose of this study is to discover potential serum protein biomarkers for SSN-PTB. Surface-enhanced laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from SSN-PTB patients (N = 66), SSP-PTB patients (N = 49), and healthy volunteers (N = 80). The serum protein profiles were analyzed with Biomarker Wizard system. A classification model was established using Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Fifty-eight protein peaks were identified to exhibit significant differences between SSN-PTB, SSP-PTB and healthy control groups (P < 0.05), among which 6 peaks were found to be down-regulated, while 10 peaks were up-regulated gradually in the healthy control, SSN-PTB, and SSP-PTB groups. Twenty-three discriminating m/z peaks were detected between SSN-PTB patients and healthy controls (P < 0.01, Fold >= 1.5). The classification tree combined with three protein peaks (2747.0, 4480.0, and 9410.1 Da) could distinguish SSN-PTB patients from healthy controls with a sensitivity of 83.33% and a specificity of 82.50%. Early diagnosis of SSN-PTB disease is critical in order to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with TB. The study will help to clarify the role of differential proteins in the pathogenesis of TB.

Above the critical micelle concentration, PRB forms nanodisks in the aqueous solution. The addition of acetate ions induces a morphological change in self-assembled aggregates, which convert into nanofibers with a diameter of several nanometers. More interestingly, along with the morphological change, the fluorescence of the assemblies was enhanced concomitantly, which can be attributed to the binding effect of acetate ions on pyridinium head groups of PRB.

Interestingly, several unusual [M + 15](+), [M + 33](+) and [M+ 47](+) ions were observed with a high abundance in the ESI-MS spectrum when methanol was used as the ESI solvent. However, only the protonated molecule was obtained with acetonitrile as the ESI solvent. These unusual ions have been proposed as the intermediates of an aldolization reaction occurring in the ESI source, which have been validated by a tandem mass spectrometry experiment, high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis and theoretical calculations. A full understanding of this reaction can contribute to the avoidance of analysis errors in the ESI-MS analysis of unknown heteroaromatic aldehydes.

A highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) can be used as a predictor of future coronary events in healthy populations and in patients with angina. However, the relationship between hs-CRP and coronary lesion characteristics as well as their associations with clinical outcomes in Chinese patients with coronary artery diseases has not been well described. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of coronary lesion characteristics and hs-CRP in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease. Coronary lesion characteristics were characterized by intravascular ultrasound. Serum hs-CRP and pro-matrix metalloproteinase-1 (ProMMP-1) concentrations were measured by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 184 patients. Among these patients, 101 suffered from acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and 83 suffered from stable angina (SA). These patients were followed up for one year to monitor subsequent major adverse cardiac events (MACE). Patients with ACS exhibited an increased external elastic membrane cross-sectional area, plaque burden, lipid pool burden, and remodeling index compared with the patients with SA (P < 0.05). Rupture and vulnerable plaques were more frequently observed in patients with ACS than in patients with SA (40.59% vs. 1.20% and 42.57% vs. 3.61%, respectively; P < 0.001). Serum hs-CRP and proMMP-1 concentrations were higher in patients with ACS (18.17 [6.32, 22.10] mg/L vs. 3.75 [1.86, 4.32] mg/L, P < 0.001 and 1.56 [0.72, 1.82] ng/ml vs. 1.14 [0.75, 1.14] ng/ml, P = 0.012]. Strong associations were found between hs-CRP, proMMP-1 and plaque type. Univariate analysis found that ACS, Troponin I and hs-CRP were associated with MACE, while multivariate logistic regression found that only hs-CRP was independently associated with MACE for one year. An increase in hs-CRP is correlated with rupture and vulnerable plaques. hs-CRP but not plaque morphology is associated with poor prognosis in Chinese patients with coronary artery disease.

The effect of polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) solution as a protective colloid on the redispersibility of the polyacrylate powder was investigated, along with the stabilization of the reconstituted emulsion. The results show that bulk carboxylic ions were formed on the particle surface when the pH value was between 9.0 and 10.0, leading to a high zeta potential and strong electrostatic repulsion force among the latex particles of the reconstituted emulsion. The hydrophilic group -OH of the protective colloid PVA combined with water molecules and the hydrophobic polyethylene long-chain groups were adhered onto the particle surface of the reconstituted emulsion latex, which induced steric hindrance between latex particles and prevented particle aggregation. The synergistic effect of the strong electrostatic repulsion force produced by carboxylic ions and the space steric hindrance generated by the PVA solution provided excellent redispersibility and stability to the reconstituted emulsion.

There is as yet little information regarding the toxicity of benzimidazole fungicides to human placenta. In this study, we utilized human placental trophoblast cell line HTR-8/SVneo (HTR-8) to access the toxic effects of benomyl and carbendazim. Our data showed that these two fungicides decreased cell viability and the percentages of cells in G0/G1 phase, as well as induced apoptosis of HTR-8 cells. The invasion and migration of HTR-8 cells were significantly inhibited by benomyl and carbendazim. We further found that benomyl and carbendazim altered the expression of protease systems (MMPs/TIPMs and uPA/PAI-1) and adhesion molecules (integrin alpha 5 and beta 1) in HTR-8 cells. Our present study firstly shows the deleterious effects of benomyl and carbendazim on placental cells and suggests a potential risk of benzimidazole fungicides to human reproduction.

This study aims to investigate the effect of acute exercise on mitochondrial H2O2 production and its association with p(66Shc), FOXO3a, and antioxidant enzymes. Male ICR/CD-1 mice were subjected to an acute exercise. Muscle tissues (gastrocnemius and quadriceps femoris) were taken after exercise to measure mitochondrial H2O2 content, expression of p(66Shc) and FOXO3a, and the activity of antioxidant enzymes. The results showed that acute exercise significantly increased mitochondrial H2O2 content and expressions of p(66Shc) and FOXO3a in a time-dependent manner, with a linear correlation between the increase in H2O2 content and p(66Shc) or FOXO3a expression. The activity of mitochondrial catalase was slightly reduced in the 90 min exercise group, but it was significantly higher in groups with 120 and 150 min exercise compared to that of 90 min exercise group. The activity of SOD was not significantly affected. The results indicate that acute exercise increases mitochondrial H2O2 production in the skeletal muscle, which is associated with the upregulation of p(66Shc) and FOXO3a. The association of p(66Shc) and FOXO3a signaling with exercise induced H2O2 generation may play a role in regulating cellular oxidative stress during acute exercise.

Compound 1 crystallizes in monoclinic, P2(1)/n space group with a = 7.0304(3), b = 10.3047(3), c = 10.6446(4) angstrom, beta= 107.174(4)degrees, V = 736.78(5) angstrom(3), Z = 4, C4H5CdClN2O3, M-r = 276.95, D-c = 2.497 g/cm(3), F(000) = 528.0, mu = 3.281 mm(-1), R = 0.0169 and wR = 0.0387. The central metals adopt distorted octahedral geometry. Carboxyl groups of the ligand connect Cd(II) into a one-dimensional chain, which further constructs a two-dimensional network by halogen bridging. Such two-dimensional structures are finally connected into a three-dimensional supramolecular architecture due to the hydrogen bonds and intermolecular pi-pi interactions. In addition, complex 1 has high thermal stability.

Existing treatments for IBD include control of active inflammation and regulation of immune disorders, and commonly used drugs include salicylates, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants. At the same time, an in-depth study of IBD pathogenesis promoted the acceptance of bioimmunotherapy by increasing numbers of people. However, long-term use of these drugs can cause adverse reactions that are difficult for patients to overcome, with limited efficacy for critically ill patients. Recent studies have found that stem cell transplantation is a new and effective therapy and IBD treatment, particularly for refractory cases. Stem cells, especially induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), can differentiate into functional intestinal epithelia and their use avoids ethical issues arising from embryonic stem cells, providing a new kind of seed cell for alternative treatments for IBD. This paper reviews iPSCs as a potential new treatment for IBDs in order to provide an experimental and clinical reference.

After the sludge was characterized using instrumental techniques (SEM, FTIR, and TG-DTA), adsorption studies were performed in a batch system, and the effects of various experimental parameters were evaluated upon CV adsorption. The results revealed that more irregular pores, higher surface roughness, and a greater content of oxygen functional groups formed in adsorbents derived from direct incineration (SC). Batch experiments revealed that stirring intension had the least effect on CV adsorption. With increasing adsorbent dosage, the CV removal efficiency increased, but the opposite result was observed for the effect of particle size. CV adsorption onto the three adsorbents was a rapid adsorption process and that onto SC was the most rapid, with the first-order kinetic model best describing the adsorption. The equilibrium data fit the Landgmiur isotherm models best, whereas much higher CV adsorption capacity and better adsorption strength onto SC were found. Desorption studies showed that acid solution was beneficial to the desorption process and the desorption rate of acetic acid reached up to about 55%. Those results proved that the solidified landfilled sewage sludge previously modified by incineration treatment was an effective adsorbent for CV removal from aqueous solution.

However, the wgl1 mutant gradually changed in color from white-green to light green at the later stages of development in field-grown plants. Pigment investigation showed that the change in leaf color in wgl1 mutant is associated with chlorophyll (Chl) and carotenoid content reduction. Electron microscopic analysis of wgl1 chloroplasts revealed a decrease in the number of chloroplasts and loss of grana stacks. In addition, the prolamellar bodies of wgl1etioplasts were smaller than that of NIP etioplasts with concentric-rings stromal thylakoids in 7-d-old darkness-grown seedlings. As a result, chloroplast development was impaired. Genetic analysis results showed that the wgl1 mutant phenotype was caused by recessive mutations in a single nuclear gene. Map-based cloning and complementation tests revealed that WGL1, located on chromosome 10, encodes OsPOR B (Os10 g35370), one of two isoforms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 2'-phosphate reduced tetrasodium salt: protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase (POR). Real-time polymerase chain reaction analysis and beta-Glucuronidase reporter results showed that the highest expression levels were observed in flag leaves, whereas expression in the root was almost undetected. These results indicate that WGL1 is involved in Chl biosynthesis and chloroplast development in rice.

However, it is still unclear how motor learning affects the resting-state default-mode network (DMN). Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, this study investigated the alteration of the DMN after motor skill learning with mental imagery practice. Fourteen participants in the experimental group learned to imagine a sequential finger movement over a two-week period while twelve control participants did not undergo motor imagery learning. For the experimental group, interregional connectivity, estimated by the graph theory method, between the medial temporal lobe, lateral temporal, and lateral parietal cortex within the DMN was increased after learning, whereas activity of the DMN network, estimated by the independent component analysis method, remained stable. Moreover, the experimental group showed significant improvement in motor performance after learning and a negative correlation between the alteration of the execution rate and changes in activity in the lateral parietal cortex. These results indicate that the DMN could be sculpted by motor learning in a manner of altering interregional connectivity and may imply that the DMN plays a role in improving behavioral performance.

Numerous studies have suggested that the modulation of APOE epsilon 4 affects cognition and brain structure and function in healthy populations, particularly in the hippocampus, a key area associated with AD pathology. However, the effect of APOE epsilon 4 allele on cognitive performance, hippocampal structural morphology, and specifically on functional characteristics in patients with AD remains poorly understood. Here, we employed a neuropsychological battery test and multi-modal structural MRI and resting-state functional MRI dataset to systematically investigate cognitive performance, hippocampal structural volume, and functional properties (including local low-frequency oscillating amplitude, intra-regional functional synchrony, and inter-regional functional connectivity) in 16 APOE epsilon 4-carriers and 26 non-carriers at early stages of AD. Compared to non-carriers, APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited poorer performance on recognition performance, but performed better on the late item generation of the verbal fluency task (associated with executive function). Structural imaging analysis revealed that APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited smaller left hippocampal volumes compared to non-carriers, and the result remains significant after correcting for effects of brain size. Functional imaging analysis revealed that APOE epsilon 4-carriers exhibited decreased amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations in the left hippocampus, non-significant changes in intra-regional synchronization within the hippocampus and decreased hippocampal functional connectivity predominantly in components of the default-mode network including the medial frontal and parietal cortices and the lateral temporal cortical regions. Taken together, our results showed APOE genotypic effects on the cognitive profile and hippocampal structural and functional characteristics in patients at early stages of AD, thus providing empirical evidence for the modulation of the APOE genotype on disease phenotype.

Some populations have been shown to possess sex chromosomes and thus genotypic sex determination (GSD), while others were reported to exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination (TSD). To test whether TSD and GSD coexist in this species or whether populations differ in their sex-determining system, we conducted egg incubation experiments to investigate how temperature influences hatchling sex in a wide range of populations of this species in China. In parallel, we used comparative genome hybridization (CGH) to study the micro-sex chromosomes of adult P. sinensis in the 2 populations that were previously identified to be TSD. The incubation experiments showed that temperature did not affect hatchling sex in any of the studied populations. CGH indicated that turtles have micro-sex chromosomes of the female heterogametic (ZZ/ZW) system in the 2 disputed populations. These results indicate that P. sinensis is a GSD rather than a TSD species. Thus, the apparent coexistence of TSD and GSD in this species is the result of previous misdiagnosis in purportedly TSD populations. (C) 2015 S.

Reproduction of massive asexual spores is the primary factor contributing to the epidemic of citrus green mold. To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying conidiogenesis in P. digitatum, we functionally characterized the Aspergillus nidulans orthologs of br1A, abaA and wetA. We showed that deletion of PdbrlA completely blocked formation of conidiophores, whereas deletion of PdabaA led to the formation of aberrant and non-functional phialides. The PdwetA mutant showed various defective phenotypes, such as abnormal conidia with loose cell walls, delayed germination and reduced tolerance to osmotic, detergent, heat shock and menadione stresses, but elevated resistance to H2O2. Pdbr/A-influenced genes were identified by comparing global gene expression profiles between the wild-type and the PdbrlA deletion mutant during conidiation. Gene ontology analysis of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs) revealed the diverse roles of PdbrIA in metabolism, transportation and cell structure. Moreover, out of 39 genes previously reported to be involved in conidiogenesis in Aspergillus, mRNA levels of 14 genes were changed in APdbr1A. Our results confirm the roles of br1A, abaA and wetA in P. digitatum conidiogenesis and provide new insights into the genetics of conidiation in filamentous fungi. (C) 2015 Institut Pasteur.

Ten juvenile male sheep weighing 20.95 +/- 2.18 kg (a range of 23-27.5 kg) were used for the experiment. The sheep were implanted with decellularized porcine valved conduits upon the native pulmonary arteries without cardiopulmonary bypass. The native pulmonary valves were destroyed to induce valve regurgitation. The native pulmonary arteries were ligated. 3 months after implantation, the function of the implanted valves was evaluated by echocardiograms. 6 months after implantation, the size and morphology of the implanted valved conduits were observed using computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest. The animals were sacrificed, and the pathological changes were observed using optical microscopy. All of the sheep developed uneventfully for more than 6 months. The postoperative echocardiograms showed that the implanted valves could open and close freely. Computed tomography (CT) angiography of the chest showed that the implanted conduits were smooth and lacked dilation and stenosis. Autopsies showed that the inner walls and the valves of the pulmonary valved conduits were smooth and lacked thrombus formation. To ensure that an appropriate pressure difference between the both sides of the implanted valves during the cardiac systolic and diastolic periods is the key factor to successfully construct an in vivo model of heart valves without cardiopulmonary bypass. Our method is convenient, economical, minimally invasive, and more reliable, in addition to resulting in a high post-operation survival rate.

Most of them are isolated nanoparticles with simple geometric features, such as nanodots, nanorods and nanospheres. In this work, we demonstrated that ordered mesoporous CdS with a complex cubic Ia3d gyroidal 3D bicontinuous porous structure and large particle size can be successfully converted to crystalline CuS and Ag2S materials via cation exchange reaction without destroying the well-defined nanostructure. The change in crystal structure is an important factor for a successful conversion when the reaction is carried out without the presence of a silica template. In addition, the cation exchange reaction is sufficient for a complete compositional conversion, even when the mesostructured CdS precursor is embedded inside a mesoporous silica matrix. Our results indicate that cation exchange reaction may be applied to highly complex nanostructures with extremely large particle sizes.

Plants have evolved different strategies to achieve salt tolerance. miR393 has been identified as closely related to biotic and abiotic stresses, and targets F-box genes that encode auxin receptors. The miR393-TIR1/AFB2/AFB3 regulatory module was discovered to have multiple functions that manipulate the auxin response. This study focused on miR393 and one of its targets, TIR1, and found that they played potential roles in response to salt stress. Our results showed that overexpression of a miR393-resistant TIR1 gene (mTIR1) in Arabidopsis clearly enhanced salt stress tolerance, which led to a higher germination rate, less water loss, reduced inhibition of root elongation, delayed senescence, decreased death rate and stabilized Chl content. These plants accumulated more proline and anthocyanin, and displayed enhanced osmotic stress tolerance. The expression of some salt stress-related genes was altered, and sodium content can be reduced in these plants under salt stress. We proposed that highly increased auxin signaling by overexpression of mTIR1 may trigger auxin-mediated downstream pathways to enhance plant salt stress resistance by osmoregulation and increased Na+ exclusion.

Recent neurobiological approaches have focused on, especially, the abnormal contents of consciousness, the "substantive parts" as James said, to associate them with the neural mechanisms related to sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, and the brain's underlying stimulus-induced or task-evoked activity. This leaves open, however, the neural mechanisms that provide the temporal linkage or glue between the various contents, the transitive parts that makes possible the "stream of consciousness." Interestingly, schizophrenic patients seem to suffer from abnormalities specifically in the "transitive parts" when they experience contents as temporally disconnected or fragmented which in phenomenological psychiatry has been described as "temporal fragmentation." The aim of this article is to develop so-called neurophenomenal hypothesis about the direct relationship between phenomenal features of the "stream of consciousness," the "transitive parts," and the specific neuronal mechanisms in schizophrenia as based on healthy subjects. Rather than emphasizing stimulus-induced and task-evoked activity and sensory and lateral prefrontal cortical regions as in neurocognitive approaches with their focus on the "substantive parts," the focus shifts here to the brain's intrinsic activity, its resting state activity, which may account for the temporal linkage or glue between the contents of consciousness, the transitive parts.

The WC/CMS support is characterized by XRD, SEM, and BET. Pt nanparticles are loaded on the WC/CMS support and Pt/WC/CMS catalyst is formed. The onset potential of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on Pt/WC/CMS is 120 mV higher than that on Pt/C, indicating the superior ORR performance of Pt/WC/CMS. The Pt/WC/CMS catalyst shows higher electrocatalytic activity for ethanol electrooxidation than Pt/C (E-TEK). The higher I-f/I-b ratio of Pt/WC/CMS indicates better resistance to carbon monoxide poisoning on the Pt/WC/CMS. The rate constant of oxygen reduction reaction for Pt/WC/CMS is twice as high as that of Pt/C, indicating the synergetic effects between the Pt and the WC support. The electrochemical stability of Pt/WC/CMS is higher than that of Pt/C, which can be attributed to the high stability of WC support. (C) The Author(s) 2015. Published by ECS. All rights reserved.

UV-vis spectra, electrochemistry and thermogravimetric analysis results reveal that this material has a large energy bandgap, low-lying highest occupied molecular orbital level and good thermal stability. Atomic force microscopy demonstrates that the thin films show high surface roughness and consisted of interconnected sheet-like crystalline grains. A highly ordered aggregation structure in grains was evidenced by X-ray diffraction measurements. Mobility up to 0.04 cm(2) V-1 s(-1) and an on/off ratio over 10(5) were achieved for the thin film field-effect transistors. These results suggest that this new benzoannulated pentathienoacene derivative is an important member of the thienoacene family and will contribute to a comprehensive analysis of the structure-property relationship of the thienoacene analogue.

The shortest time (0.5 min) was obtained for one separation with 1.5 mL min(-1) of methanol-water 50 : 50 (v/v) as the mobile phase at a column temperature of 30 degrees C. A linear response between peak area and the concentration of formaldehyde was obtained over the range 0.1 to 20 mg L-1 with a relative standard deviation of 1.4% (n = 10) at the concentration of 1.0 mg L-1 and a detection limit of 5.1 mg L-1. The confirmation assay by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry indicated that there was no interfering effect from other carbonyl compounds. The proposed method was applied for the determination of formaldehyde residue in cosmetics at the mg L-1 level. Free formaldehyde up to 27 mg kg(-1) was found in cosmetics and the spike recovery at the spiked levels of 1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 varying from 92% to 105% was also obtained. The difference between the values determined by the proposed method and the standard spectrophotometric method was below 3.7%. The results proved the accuracy and precision of the method, showing potential for the routine analysis of formaldehyde residue.

This may be due to the impact of different frequency bands. In this study, we examined the ALFF in five different frequency bands (slow-6: 0-0.01Hz; slow-5: 0.01-0.027Hz; slow-4: 0.027-0.073Hz; slow-3: 0.073-0.167Hz, and slow-2: 0.167-0.25Hz) within the whole brain during resting-state fMRI in 16 LOD patients and 16 normal control (NC) subjects. The ALFF of primary effect of disease was widely distributed over left cerebellum anterior lobe, left cerebellum posterior lobe, left middle orbitofrontal gyrus, left superior occipital, and right superior parietal, while the interaction effect of disease and frequency was distributed over right superior frontal gyrus. Further relationship analysis findings suggest these abnormal ALFF may relate to cognitive dysfunction of LOD. Therefore, our data show that LOD patients have widespread abnormalities in intrinsic brain activity, which is dependent on the frequency band, and suggest that future studies should take the frequency bands into account when measuring intrinsic brain activity.

A compact three-level power divider is developed to provide the required phase distribution and enhanced co-phase bandwidth. Then, the Elliott's design procedure is employed taking accurately into account both the external coupling and the high-order mode internal coupling. The measured radiation pattern and the frequency response are in very good agreement with design specifications and with simulated results provided by CST Microwave Studio. The measured sidelobe level at the center frequency is below -32.3 dB in the E-plane and below -33.8 dB in the H-plane for a design goal of -35 dB.

Some special nonlocal symmetries and nonlocal conservation laws are obtained from the linearized equations of the SG equation and its BT. Furthermore, one can derive infinitely many nonlocal symmetries from a known nonlocal symmetry, but also infinitely many nonlocal conservation laws from a known nonlocal conservation law. In addition, infinitely many local and nonlocal conservation laws can be directly generated from the BT through the parameter expansion procedure. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Accumulating evidence suggests that epigenetic mechanisms play important roles in hypoxia-induced EMT and metastasis. These epigenetic regulations are mediated by various players including chromatin modifiers, transcriptional co-regulators, microRNAs, etc. In this review, we discuss how his tone-modifying enzymes and transcriptional co-regulators regulate EMT under hypoxic conditions. Developed or potential anticancer agents targeting epigenetic molecules regulating hypoxia-induced EMT are also discussed.

The analytical propagation expression for the AHB with OAM passing through an ABCD optical system is derived. The effect of topological charge (TC) on the propagation properties of the AHB with OAM is studied numerically. The dependence of the normalized intensity distribution, the phase distribution and the optical angular momentum density (OAMD) distribution of the proposed beam on its TC is illustrated numerically. Furthermore, it is found that the intensity distribution, phase distribution, and the OAMD distribution are shaped through varying the TC and propagation distance. Our results will be useful for optical communication and optical trapping.

However, it has remained unclear whether PF treatment can inhibit allergic inflammation in asthma. In this study, we evaluated the effects of PF on pulmonary function and airway inflammation in asthmatic mice. The allergic asthma models were established in BALB/c mice. The mice were sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin. Airway hyperresponsiveness was detected by direct airway resistance analysis. Lung tissues were examined for inflammatory cell infiltration. IL-5, IL-13, IL-17, and eotaxin in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and their mRNA expression in lung tissue were examined by ELISA and realtime PCR, respectively. The total IgE level in serum was measured by ELISA. The protein expression of p-ERK and p-JNK was detected by western blot. Our data showed that PF oral administration significantly reduced airway hyperresponsiveness to aerosolized methacholine and decreased IL-5, IL-13, IL-17 and eotaxin levels in the BALF, and decreased IgE level in the serum. Histological studies showed that PF administration markedly decreased inflammatory infiltration. Similarly, treatment with PF significantly inhibited IL-5, IL-13, IL-17 and eotaxin mRNA expression in lung tissues. The protein expression levels of p-ERK and p-JNK were substantially decreased after oral administration of PF. In summary, PF displayed anti-inflammatory effects in the OVA-induced asthmatic model by decreasing the expression of IL-5, IL-13, IL-17 and eotaxin. These effects were mediated at least partially by inhibiting the activation of MAPK pathway. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, previous studies have been mainly focused on the topological properties of the stationary ground state. Here, we investigate the quench dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled two-dimensional Fermi gas in which the Zeeman field serves as the major quench parameter. Three post-quench dynamical phases are identified according to the asymptotic behaviour of the order parameter. In the undamped phase, a persistent oscillation of the order parameter may support a topological Floquet state with multiple edge states. In the damped phase, the magnitude of the order parameter approaches a constant via a power-law decay, which may support a dynamical topological phase with one edge state at the boundary. In the overdamped phase, the order parameter decays to zero exponentially although the condensate fraction remains finite. These predictions can be observed in the strong-coupling regime.

The materials were synthesized through a combination of a sol-gel process and in situ reduction of HAuCl4 by hydrazine to Au nanoparticles in the nanocomposite particles. The photocatalytic activity of the as-synthesized Au/amorphous TiO2 nanocomposite particles is much higher than that of the Au/anatase TiO2 and Au/rutile TiO2 nanocomposite particles prepared by calcination. Therefore, no further heat treatments are required to achieve visible-light photocatalytic active catalysts. The loading of Au in the nanocomposite particles could be conveniently tuned by varying the HAuCl4 loading in the dispersed phase of the inverse miniemulsions. Only a small amount of Au was required to achieve a high photocatalytic activity. The size, particle morphology, TiO2 phase, optical property, elemental content and distribution, and pore properties of the Au/TiO2 nanocomposite particles were systematically characterized by dynamic light scattering, transmission/scanning electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, UV-vis spectroscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and N-2 sorption measurements.

Despite extensive studies, the exact functions, as well as if and how these two pathways act coordinately in regulating early tooth development, remain elusive. In this study, we dissected regulatory functions of BMP and Wnt pathways in early tooth development using a transgenic noggin (Nog) overexpression model (K14Cre; pNog). It exhibits early arrested tooth development, accompanied by reduced cell proliferation and loss of odontogenic fate marker Pitx2 expression in the dental epithelium. We demonstrated that overexpression of Nog disrupted BMP non-canonical activity, which led to a dramatic reduction of cell proliferation rate but did not affect Pitx2 expression. We further identified a novel function of Nog by inhibiting Wnt/beta-catenin signaling, causing loss of Pitx2 expression. Co-immunoprecipitation and TOPflash assays revealed direct binding of Nog to Wnts to functionally prevent Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. In situ PLA and immunohistochemistry on Nog mutants confirmed in vivo interaction between endogenous Nog and Wnts and modulation of Wnt signaling by Nog in tooth germs. Genetic rescue experiments presented evidence that both BMP and Wnt signaling pathways contribute to cell proliferation regulation in the dental epithelium, with Wnt signaling also controlling the odontogenic fate. Reactivation of both BMP and Wnt signaling pathways, but not of only one of them, rescued tooth developmental defects in K14Cre; pNog mice, in which Wnt signaling can be substituted by transgenic activation of Pitx2. Our results reveal the orchestration of non-canonical BMP and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in the regulation of early tooth development.

In this paper, we report our work on using molecular dynamics simulation to study the dependence of DNA sequencing on the translocation time of DNA through a graphene nanopore, using the single-strand DNA fragment translocation through graphene nanopores with diameters down to similar to 2 nm as examples. We found that A, T, C, and G could be identified by the difference in the translocation time between different types of nucleotides through 2 nm graphene nanopores. In particular, the recognition of the graphene nanopore for different nucleotides can be greatly enhanced in a low electric field. Our study suggests that the recognition of a graphene nanopore by different nucleotides is the key factor for sequencing DNA by translocation time. Our study also indicates that the surface of a graphene nanopore can be modified to increase the recognition of nucleotides and to improve the resolution of DNA sequencing based on the DNA translocation time with a suitable electric field.

However, knowledge remains limited about how such effects vary across populations. Here, we investigated whether incubation temperature (26, 28, and 30 degrees C) differentially affects the embryonic development of Asian yellow pond turtle (Mauremys mutica) eggs originating from low-latitude (Guangzhou, 23 degrees 06N) and high-latitude (Haining, 30 degrees 19N) populations in China. At 26 degrees C, the duration of incubation was shorter in the high-latitude population than in the low-latitude population. However, this pattern was reversed at 30 degrees C. As the incubation temperature increased, hatching success increased in the low-latitude population but slightly decreased in the high-latitude population. Hatchlings incubated at 30 degrees C were larger and righted themselves more rapidly than those incubated at 26 degrees C in the low-latitude population. In contrast, hatchling traits were not influenced by incubation temperature in the high-latitude population. Overall, 30 degrees C was a suitable developmental temperature for embryos from the low-latitude population, whereas 26 and 28 degrees C were suitable for those from the high-latitude population. This interpopulation difference in suitable developmental temperatures is consistent with the difference in the thermal environment of the two localities. Therefore, similarly to posthatching individuals, reptile embryos from different populations might have evolved diverse physiological strategies to benefit from the thermal environment in which they develop.(c) 2014 The Linnean Society of London, Biological Journal of the Linnean Society, 2014, 114, 35-43.

J	Lv, MQ; Li, YL; Yuan, ZM; Wang, QH				Lv, Mingqi; Li, Yinglong; Yuan, Zhenming; Wang, Qihui			Route Pattern Mining From Personal Trajectory Data	JOURNAL OF INFORMATION SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING			English	Article						route pattern; personal trajectory data; data mining; future route prediction; trajectory abstraction		The discovery of route patterns from trajectory data generated by moving objects is an essential problem for location-aware computing. However, the high degree of uncertainty of personal trajectory data significantly disturbs the existing route pattern mining approaches, and results in finding only short and incomplete patterns with high computational complexity. In this paper, we propose a personal trajectory data mining framework, which includes a group-and-partition trajectory abstraction technique and a frequent pattern mining algorithm called SCPM (Spatial Continuity based Pattern Mining). The group-and-partition technique can discover common sub-segments which are used to abstract the original trajectory data. The SCPM algorithm can efficiently derive longer and more complete route patterns from the abstracted personal trajectory data by tolerating various kinds of disturbances during the trips. Based on the real-world personal trajectory data, we conducted a number of experiments to evaluate the performance of our framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our framework is more efficient and effective as compared with the existing route pattern mining approaches, and the extracted route patterns can be effectively utilized to predict users' future route.

However, why obese individuals eat more still remains unclear. Recent functional neuroimaging studies have found abnormal brain activations in obese people. In the present study, we used resting state functional MRI to observe spontaneous blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations during both hunger and satiety states in 20 lean and 20 obese men. Using a regional homogeneity (ReHo) analysis method, we measured temporal homogeneity of the regional BOLD signals. We found that, before food intake, obese men had significantly increased synchronicity of activity in the left putamen relative to lean men. Decreased synchronicity of activity was found in the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and medial prefrontal cortex(MPFC) in the obese subjects. And, the ratings of hunger of the obese subjects were higher than those of the lean subjects before food intake. After food intake, we did not find the significant differences between the obese men and the lean men. In all participations, synchronicity of activity increased from the fasted to the satiated state in the OFC. The results indicated that OFC plays an important role in feeding behavior, and OFC signaling may be disordered in obesity. Obese men show less inhibitory control during fasting state. This study has provided strong evidence supporting the hypothesis that there is a hypo-functioning reward circuitry in obese individuals, in which the frontal cortex may fail to inhibit the striatum, and consequently lead to overeating and obesity.

Researches indicated that the Hippo pathway is a key regulator of organ size and is conserved during evolution. Furthermore, studies of mouse models and clinical samples demonstrated the importance of Hippo pathway dysregulation in human cancer development. In addition, the Hippo pathway contributes to progenitor cell and stem cell self-renewal and is thus involved in tissue regeneration. In the Hippo pathway, MST1/2 kinases together with the adaptor protein SAV phosphorylate LATS1/2 kinases. Interaction with an adaptor protein MOB is also important for LATS1/2 activation. Activated LATS1/2 in turn phosphorylate and inhibit Yes-associated protein (YAP). YAP is a key downstream effector of the Hippo pathway, and is a transcriptional co-activator that mainly interacts with TEAD family transcription factors to promote gene expression. Alteration of gene expression by YAP leads to cell proliferation, apoptosis evasion, and also stem cell amplification. In this review, we mainly focus on YAP, discussing its regulation and mechanisms of action in the context of organ size control, tissue regeneration and tumorigenesis.

However, its effects on bacterium-induced acute lung injury (ALI) are not fully understood. ObjectiveTo investigate the protective effects of curcumin on a mouse model of S.aureus-induced ALI. MethodsMice were pretreated with intraperitoneal injection of curcumin or vehicle 2h before Staphylococcusaureus instillation. The survival rate and bacterial burden after infection were recorded. Mice were sacrificed for the analyses of severity of pneumonia, integrity of lung barrier, disorder of coagulation cascades and extent of inflammation 12h postinfection. The production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in the lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was detected. ResultsPretreatment with curcumin markedly attenuated S.aureus-induced pneumonia, barrier disruption, lung edema and vascular leakage. Activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and infiltration of neutrophils were reduced by curcumin, together with lower levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines. ConclusionCurcumin can alleviate S.aureus-induced ALI through multiple pathways.

However, several problems exist in treating multiple segmental thoracolumbar TB, including reducing surgical trauma with effective incision exposure; ensuring the effective long-armed fixation, and maintaining the possibility for revisionary surgery in cases of treatment failure. PURPOSE: To investigate the clinical efficacy and surgical technique of the single posterior midline approach for screw-rod fixation and debridement through the sacrospinalis muscle outer cross-window to treat multiple segmental thoracolumbar spinal TB. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective cohort study. PATIENT SAMPLE: A group of 17 patients with spinal TB after surgical treatment, with a mean follow-up of 27.9 months (range, 18-48 months). OUTCOME MEASURES: Neurologic recovery, Cobb angle, and graft union assessed by the Moon standard. METHODS: This study was approved by the local ethical committee and recruited patients from January, 2005 to January, 2011. We used a posterior midline incision for internal fixation of a pedicle screw system in the gap of the longissimus and spinal multifidus. Anterior lesion debridement and interbody fusions were performed through bilateral cross-windows in the outer edge of the sacrospinalis muscle. Using this technique, we treated 17 patients (10 men; aged 19 to 68 years; mean 39.8 years) with spinal TB involving more than four vertebrae. Nerve damage was classified by the Frankel classification. All patients were treated with regular anti-TB chemotherapy and were followed for 18 to 48 (mean: 27.9 months) months. RESULTS: The mean (range) for operative time was 4.7 (3.6-6.3) hours, for blood loss during surgery was 1,100 (850-2,300) mL, and for time of interbody fusion was 6.3 (4 to 11) months. The Cobb angle correction rate is 67.1%. Nine of 11 patients' neurologic function returned to normal, which was statistically significant (p=.004). There was no TB recurrence or internal fixation failure. CONCLUSIONS: Combined with anti-TB chemotherapy, the discussed surgical technique can show improved lesion clearance, decompression of the anterior aspect of the spine, bone graft fusion, internal fixation of outside lesions, drainage and lead to positive treatment outcomes.

Imidazoles, benzimidazole, indole, pyrrolidine and diphenyl disulfide undergo reactions with aryl halides in the presence of 10 mol% D-glucosamine, 10 mol% CuI, and 2 equiv. of Cs2CO3 in DMSO-H2O at moderate temperature to give the corresponding products in good to excellent yields. Substrates bearing halides, free amino groups, trifluoromethyl and heterocycles were well tolerated. The high water solubility of the ligand enables easy catalyst removal. In addition, the application of this catalytic system for the synthesis of nilotinib intermediate was also successfully demonstrated using commercially available substrates.

Based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional and free weighting matrix method, some novel delay-dependent global asymptotic stability results are derived in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) which can be easily solved using efficient convex optimization algorithms. The results show that the system stability is very sensitive to the singular perturbation and the small parameter in time delays. A numerical example is given to show the effectiveness of the proposed results. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As one of the major auxin early response gene families, Gretchen Hagen 3 (GH3) genes are involved in auxin homeostasis by conjugating excess auxins to amino acids. However, how GH3 genes function in environmental stresses and rhizobial infection responses in Medicago truncatula are largely unknown. Here, based on the latest updated M. truncatula genome, a comprehensive identification and expression profiling analysis of MtGH3 genes were performed. Our data showed that most of MtGH3 genes were expressed in tissue-specific manner and were responsive to environmental stress-related hormones. To understand the possible roles of MtGH3 genes involved in symbiosis establishment between M. truncatula and symbiotic bacteria, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expressions of MtGH3 genes during the early phase of Sinorhizobium meliloti infection. The expression levels of most MtGH3 genes were upregulated in shoots and downregulated in roots by S. meliloti infection. The differences in expression responses to S. meliloti infection between roots and shoots were in agreement with the results of free indoleacetic acid (IAA) content measurements. The identification and expression analysis of MtGH3 genes at the early phase of S. meliloti infection may help us to understand the role of GH3-mediated IAA homeostasis in the regulation of nodule formation in model legumes M. truncatula.

Many factors affect gut microbiota; application of broad range antibiotics disturb microbiota, while probiotic application protects the microbiota. To investigate how probiotics alter the physiological and psychological changes induced by antibiotics, we tested the performance of ampicillin-treated rats in the presence or absence of Lactobacillus fermentum strain NS9, in elevated plus maze and Morris water maze. The results showed that NS9 normalised the composition of gut microbiota and alleviated the ampicillin-induced inflammation in the colon. The levels of the mineralocorticoid and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors were also elevated in the hippocampus of the ampillicin+ NS9 treated group. NS9 administration also reduced the anxiety-like behaviour and alleviated the ampicillin-induced impairment in memory retention. These findings suggest that NS9 is beneficial to the host, because it restores the physiological and psychological abnormalities induced by ampicillin. Our results highlight how gut contents regulate the brain, and shed light on the clinical applications of probiotics to treat the side effect of antibiotics and mental disorders.

Divergence of above- and belowground C and N pool within predominant plant species along two precipitation gradients in North China	BIOGEOSCIENCES			English	Article							METROSIDEROS-POLYMORPHA; BIOMASS ALLOCATION; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; NITROGEN-USE; CARBON; WATER; VARIABILITY; NUTRIENT; CLIMATE; SOIL	The coupling of carbon cycle and nitrogen cycle drives the food web structure and biogeochemistry of an ecosystem. However, across precipitation gradients, there may be a shift in C pool and N pool from above-to belowground because of shifting plant stoichiometry and allocation. Based on previous evidence, biomass allocation to roots should increase with aridity, while leaf [N] should increase. If their effect sizes are equal, they should cancel each other out, and the above-and belowground proportions of the N would remain constant. Here, we present the first study to explicitly compare above-and belowground pool sizes of N and C within predominant plant species along precipitation gradients. Biomass and nutrient concentrations of leaves, stems and roots of three predominant species were measured along two major precipitation gradients in Inner Mongolia, China. Along the two gradients, the effect sizes of the biomass shifts were remarkably consistent among three predominant species. However, the size of the shift in aboveground [N] was not, leading to a species-specific pattern in above-and belowground pool size. In two species (Stipa grandis and Artemisia ordosica) the effect sizes of biomass allocation and [N] were equal and the proportion of N of above-and belowground did not change with aridity, but in S. bungeana the increase in leaf [N] with aridity was much weaker than the biomass shift, leading to a decrease in the proportion of N aboveground at dry sites. We have found examples of consistent N pool sizes above-and belowground and a shift to a greater proportion of belowground N in drier sites depending on the species. We suggest that precipitation gradients do potentially decouple the C and N pool, but the exact nature of the decoupling depends on the dominant species' capacity for intraspecific variation.	[Ye, X.

J	Dong, GG; Du, RJ; Tian, LX; Liu, RR				Dong, Gaogao; Du, Ruijin; Tian, Lixin; Liu, Runran			Percolation on interacting networks with feedback-dependency links	CHAOS			English	Article							ROBUSTNESS	When real networks are considered, coupled networks with connectivity and feedback-dependency links are not rare but more general. Here, we develop a mathematical framework and study numerically and analytically the percolation of interacting networks with feedback-dependency links. For the case that all degree distributions of intra-and inter-connectivity links are Poissonian, we find that for a low density of inter-connectivity links, the system undergoes from second order to first order through hybrid phase transition as coupling strength increases. It implies that the average degree (k) over bar of inter-connectivity links has a little influence on robustness of the system with a weak coupling strength, which corresponds to the second order transition, but for a strong coupling strength corresponds to the first order transition. That is to say, the system becomes robust as (k) over bar increases. However, as the average degree k of each network increases, the system becomes robust for any coupling strength. In addition, we find that one can take less cost to design robust system as coupling strength decreases by analyzing minimum average degree k(min) of maintaining system stability. Moreover, for high density of inter-connectivity links, we find that the hybrid phase transition region disappears, the first order region becomes larger and second order region becomes smaller. For the case of two coupled scale-free networks, the system also undergoes from second order to first order through hybrid transition as the coupling strength increases. We find that for a weak coupling strength, which corresponds to the second order transitions, feedback dependency links have no effect on robustness of system relative to no-feedback condition, but for strong coupling strength which corresponds to first order or hybrid phase transition, the system is more vulnerable under feedback condition comparing with no-feedback condition. Thus, for designing resilient system, designers should try to avoid the feedback dependency links, because the existence of feedback-dependency links makes the system extremely vulnerable and difficult to defend.

Early examples for the synthesis of C-S bonds are generally limited to the condensation reaction between a metal thiolate and an organic halide. Recent chemical approaches for C-S bond formation, based upon direct C-H bond functionalization and decarboxylative reactions, not only provide new insights into the mechanistic understanding of C-S coupling reactions but also allow the synthesis of sulfur-containing compounds from more effective synthetic routes with high atom economy. This review intends to explore recent advances in C-S bond formation via C-H functionalization and decarboxylation, and the growing opportunities they present to the construction of complex chemical scaffolds for applications encompassing natural product synthesis, synthetic methodology development, and functional materials as well as nanotechnology.

The feasibility for their community-based bioassessment was studied in a mid-subtropical canal (Tiesha River), southern China, during a 1-year cycle (November 2009-December 2010). Samples were monthly collected at four sampling stations within a contamination gradient. Environmental variables, such as water temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO), chemical oxygen demand (COD), biological oxygen demand (BOD5), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN), were measured synchronously for comparison with biotic parameters. The phytoplankton community structures showed a significant difference among four stations. The spatial variation in abundance was significantly correlated with the changes in environmental variables, especially TN, TP, and COD. Four dominant species (Aulacoseira granulata, Leptocylindrus danicus, Oscillatoria tenuis, and Radiococcus nimbatus) were significantly correlated with nutrients, while the species richness index represented a significant correlation with BOD5. The phytoplankton-based Saprobien indices could not reveal the spatial variation in water quality status although may reflect water pollution levels (from beta- to alpha-mesosaprobic zone) in the canal system. It is suggested that phytoplankton communities might be used as a potentially robust bioindicator for discriminating environmental quality status in mid-tropical canal systems.

After the vegetable oil samples were prepared using gel permeation chromatography, the eluent was collected, evaporated and dried with nitrogen gas. The residue was silylated with N,O-bis-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide, containing 1% trimethylchlorosilane. GC-QqQ MS was performed in the reaction-monitoring mode to confirm and quantify mycotoxins in vegetable oil. The limits of quantitation were 0.03-0.2 mu g kg(-1) for the six mycotoxins. The average recoveries, measured at 2, 20 and 200 mu g kg(-1), were in the range 80.3-96.5%. Zearalenone was detected in the range 5.2-184.6 mu g kg(-1) in nine maize oils and at 40.7 mu g kg(-1) in a rapeseed oil from the local market. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this method, multiple cells are combined into cellets in the proposed categorization model, which are highly responsive to an object's fine categories. The object components are represented by cellets that can connect spatially adjacent cells within the same pyramid level. Here, image categorization can be formulated as the matching between the cellets of corresponding images. Toward an effective matching process, an active learning algorithm that can effectively select a few representative cells for constructing the cellets is adopted. A linear-discriminant-analysis-like scheme is employed to select discriminative cellets. Then, fine-grained image categorization can be conducted with a trained linear support vector machine.

J	Qin, BD; Liu, SL; Chen, KF				Qin, Baodong; Liu, Shengli; Chen, Kefei			Efficient chosen-ciphertext secure public-key encryption scheme with high leakage-resilience	IET INFORMATION SECURITY			English	Article							CRYPTOSYSTEMS RESILIENT; CRYPTOGRAPHY	A leakage-resilient public-key encryption (PKE) scheme provides security even if an adversary obtains some information on the secret key. In recent years, much attention has been focused on designing provably secure PKE in the presence of key-leakage and almost all the constructions rely on an important building block namely hash proof system (HPS). However, in the setting of adaptive chosen-ciphertext attacks (CCA2), there are not many HPS-based leakage-resilient PKE schemes available. Moreover, most of them have an unsatisfactory leakage rate. In this study, the authors propose a new method of constructing leakage-resilient CCA2-secure PKE scheme from any tag-based strongly universal(2) HPS. The striking advantage of the authors scheme is the leakage rate, which is the best one among all known HPS-based indistinguishability key leakage CCA2-secure constructions. In particular, they present an instantiation under the n-linear assumption. In the cases of n = 1 (resp. n = 2), they actually obtain a decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH)-based [resp. decisional linear (DLIN)-based] PKE scheme, where the leakage rate can be made to 1/4 (resp. 1/6). The authors DDH-based scheme achieves the best leakage rate among all known DDH-based (Cramer-Shoup-type) schemes. Their DLIN-based scheme is the first one that can achieve leakage of L/6 bits without pairing, where L is the length of the secret key.

Despite its effectiveness (i.e. without heavy computational overheads) in ensuring a message can only be read when all the designated parties are available, this is an under-researched topic (there are only two published MDE schemes in the literature, to the best of our knowledge). In this paper, we propose an efficient MDE scheme and prove its CCA2 security in the standard model under the decisional bilinear Diffie Hellman assumption.

Methods: A total of 72 SPF level male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study, they were divided into 9 groups randomly and 8 rats in each group. The expression changes of ATF4 and RUNX2 in periodontal tissue of pressure side at different straining time point were detected with RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. The morphological changes of cells in the tissue samples were observed by HE staining. The data were analyzed with SPSS 19.0 software. Results: The expression levels of ATF4 and RUNX2 increased during orthodontic tooth movement and were related with the movement time. They reached highest after straining for 24 h and began to decrease after straining for 12 d. Conclusions: The expression levels of ATF4 and RUNX2 in periodontal tissue can increase transiently induced by stress, which play a role in the process of osteogenesis and reconstruction of periodontal tissue during orthodontic tooth movement.

A small-bore capillary (20 mm) with a tapered tip served as the sample capillary of the nebulizer. The gas orifice diameter, the internal diameter and the wall thickness at the tip of the sample capillary were 160, 20, and 5 mm, respectively, which ensured stable generation of aerosol by the nebulizer at nanoflow rates down to 50 nL min(-1) and an ultra-low aspiration rate (80 nL min(-1)). Narrower aerosol size distribution and higher analyte transport efficiency (nearly 100%) were obtained with the proposed nebulizer than with the previous demountable capillary microflow nebulizer. The sensitivity and detection limit of the proposed nebulizer at 500 nL min(-1) were about one third of those obtained by using the demountable capillary microflow nebulizer at 5 mL min(-1), whereas the precision of the former at 500 nL min(-1) was even to some extent superior over that obtained with the latter at 5 mL min(-1). Furthermore, the ICP-MS instrument could tolerate direct introduction of 100% organic solvents by using the developed nebulizer operating at nanoflow rates. It was utilized to sheathless interface nano-high performance liquid chromatography with ICP-MS for arsenic speciation analysis with good accuracy and precision, proving its strong robustness and good suitability.

J	Luo, S; Li, XM; Li, SH; Bi, GA				Luo, Shan; Li, Xiumei; Li, Shenghong; Bi, Guoan			Adaptive Interference Suppression Based on Lv Distribution for DSSS Communications	JOURNAL OF CIRCUITS SYSTEMS AND COMPUTERS			English	Article						DSSS communications; interference suppression; time-frequency distribution; Lv distribution	SPREAD-SPECTRUM COMMUNICATIONS; FOURIER-TRANSFORM RECEIVER; CONSTANT AMPLITUDE; EXCISION; SIGNALS; SYSTEMS; PERFORMANCE; WIGNER	It is generally difficult to effectively eliminate intentional multiple component interference in any communication systems mainly because of the difficulties in accurately estimating the parameters of interference particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. This paper proposes effective methods of adaptive interference suppression based on Lv distribution (AISL) for direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) communications. Since the recently reported Lv distribution (LVD) provides better concentration of signal energy in the domain of frequency-chirp rate than other reported methods, it achieves performance improvement on estimating the parameters containing multiple linear frequency modulated (LFM) signals. With the desirable properties of the LVD, the proposed interference suppression methods are able to excise interference of multiple components. The proposed methods firstly examine if the received signal is interfered by using a high-order statistics, known as skewness, to measure the distribution concentration of the received signal in the LVD domain. Then the interference excision process is employed only when the interference is present. Two methods, i.e., AISL-I based on the concept of interference cancellation and AISL-II based on phase cancellation and filtering, are investigated. The merits of these methods are analyzed and compared in terms of bit error rates (BERs). Results of Monte Carlo experiments are also presented to show the effectiveness of suppressing interference by the proposed methods.

Schedules of survival, growth and reproduction are key life-history traits. Data on how these traits vary among species and populations are fundamental to our understanding of the ecological conditions that have shaped plant evolution. Because these demographic schedules determine population growth or decline, such data help us understand how different biomes shape plant ecology, how plant populations and communities respond to global change and how to develop successful management tools for endangered or invasive species. 2. Matrix population models summarize the life cycle components of survival, growth and reproduction, while explicitly acknowledging heterogeneity among classes of individuals in the population. Matrix models have comparable structures, and their emergent measures of population dynamics, such as population growth rate or mean life expectancy, have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among populations and species. 3. Thousands of plant matrix population models have been parameterized from empirical data, but they are largely dispersed through peer-reviewed and grey literature, and thus remain inaccessible for synthetic analysis. Here, we introduce the COMPADRE Plant Matrix Database version 3.0, an open-source online repository containing 468 studies from 598 species world-wide (672 species hits, when accounting for species studied in more than one source), with a total of 5621 matrices. COMPADRE also contains relevant ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, growth form, taxonomy, phylogeny) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from the matrices. 4. Synthesis. Large collections of data allow broad questions to be addressed at the global scale, for example, in genetics (GENBANK), functional plant ecology (TRY, BIEN, D3) and grassland community ecology (NUTNET). Here, we present COMPADRE, a similarly data-rich and ecologically relevant resource for plant demography. Open access to this information, its frequent updates and its integration with other online resources will allow researchers to address timely and important ecological and evolutionary questions.

Double layer electroluminescent devices of these silafluorene derivatives exhibited efficient blue emission. The non-doped double layer OLEDs containing TDMS, TDPS, CDMS, or CDPS exhibited better electroluminescence efficiencies than those of the devices using the reference emitter DPFL-NPB, among which the best device was with TDPS, which showed a maximum current efficiency of 1.62 cd A(-1) and an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.36%. The solution processed device using TDPS as dopant exhibited a high performance with an EQE of 2.48% and an obviously low turn-on voltage of 4 V, when compared to the results of the reference device. The replacement of the carbon atom of the fluorene unit with a silicon atom could lower the energy gap effectively and improve the thermal stability as well as optical performances. The results indicate that the end-capped arylamino groups affect the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) performances greatly and aryl or alkyl substitution on the 9-position of a silafluorene unit is also crucial to the OLED performances of this kind of silafluorene.

Based on first-principles calculation, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of bilayer hetero-sheets composed of group-V (arsenene/antimonene) and group-IV (graphene/silicene) layers. These hetero-sheets exhibit typical van der Waals features with small binding energies and soft interlayer elastic constants. In the hetero-sheets, the Dirac characteristics of the group-IV layer and the semiconducting feature of the group-V one are well preserved, which causes a Schottky contact at the metal-semiconductor interface. The Schottky barriers are always p-type in the Si-based hetero-sheets, whereas in the C-based ones, the interfacial feature is sensitive to the interlayer distance. A tensile strain would induce a p-type-to-n-type Schottky barrier transition for the As-C hetero-sheet, while a compressive strain can cause a Schottky-to-ohmic contact transition in the Sb-C one. Moreover, due to the inhomogeneous charge redistribution, a sizeable band gap is opened at the Dirac point of the Sb-Si hetero-sheet, which could be linearly modulated by perpendicular strains around the equilibrium site. The versatile electronic structures and tunable interfacial properties enable the group-V-group-IV hetero-bilayer structures to have many potential applications in nano-devices and nano-electronics.

The calmodulin-binding transcription activators (CAMTA) belong to a transcription factor family that plays critical roles in plant responses to both abiotic and biotic stresses such as drought, cold and attacks from pathogens and insects. Our current knowledge about CAMTA genes in soybean is scarce, but is of critical significance to the improvement of stress tolerance and production of soybean, a worldwide major protein-rich food crop. In this study, we first searched for all the CAMTA homologous genes in the whole genome of soybean. We then surveyed the distribution of stress-related cis-regulatory elements in the -1.5 kb promoter regions of all GmCAMTA genes. Next, we analyzed the expression patterns of all these GmCAMTAs in root and leaf tissues and studied how they respond to various stress treatments by quantitative RT-PCR. Fifteen genes in the soybean genome were identified to encode CAMTA proteins, and their gene structures and protein sequences were highly similar to that in Arabidopsis. Like their counterparts in other plants and animals, all GmCAMTAs contain a CG-1 DNA-binding domain in the N terminal region, followed by a TIG domain, ankyrin repeats, IQ motifs and a calmodulin binding site. All GmCAMTA genes were found to be expressed in root and leaf tissues. The expression of all GmCAMTAs was induced by salinity. Most of the GmCAMTA genes were induced by several stresses and hormone signals including dehydration, cold, H2O2, abscisic acid, salicylic acid, and methyl jasmonate. Only four GmCAMTAs (GmCAMTA5, 6, 7 and 10) were found to be repressed by H2O2 treatment. Consistent with their responsiveness to all these stimuli, many stress-related cis-elements were found in the promoter regions of all the GmCAMTA genes. These results indicate that GmCAMTA genes are responsive to various stress and hormone signals, and likewise, GmCAMTAs could act as critical components in regulating soybean tolerances to various environmental stresses.

The adsorbent offered adsorption capacities of 27.4 mg g(-1) for Hg2+, 62.1 mg g(-1) for MeHg and 59.6 mg g(-1) for EtHg. The enrichment could be directly performed without any column preconditioning, where commonly coexisting ions in seawater and sample pH (1.0-9.0) as well as the sampling flow rate caused no significant adverse effects. The adsorbed Hg-analytes (Hg2+, MeHg and EtHg) could be readily eluted (less than 20 s) from the surface of SH-SiO2 with 60 mu L of 100 mM L-cysteine (Cys) + 0.1 M HCl. Hence the enrichment factors of 830 for Hg2+, 916 for MeHg and 883 for EtHg were obtained using 5 mL sample in a 35 s enrichment procedure. The detection limits for Hg2+, MeHg and EtHg were 0.019, 0.013 and 0.014 ng L-1, respectively, and the relative standard deviations of peak height and peak area were all below 4% for 5 ng L-1. Mercury speciation in ten seawater samples was then analyzed by the proposed method, giving rise to satisfactory spiking recoveries (90-102%).

Optical and electrochemical measurements and DFT simulation revealed the distinctly different electronic structure of the alpha-position and beta-position linked oligomers.

The significant difference of the OFET performances and thin film microstructures between the naphthalene oligomers also confirmed that the substituted position has an important effect on the properties of semiconductor materials and the alpha-position linked oligomer is better than beta-position linked isomers.

It consisted of one high-pressure pump, a six-port injection valve, a PEEK cross, a separation and back pressure capillary, an ultraviolet-visible detector and a high voltage power supply. The pressuredriven flow ranging from 4.5 nL min(-1) to 0.81 mu L min(-1) in the separation capillary was produced by splitting to the flow from the high-pressure pumps (0.005-0.4 mL min(-1)). Nano-volume sample injection (< 10 nL) was conducted by a micro-volume rotary injector (0.5-5 mu L) with flow splitting. In the p-CE system, the new commercial capillary could be directly used without any wash, and the capillary-flush process between runs was also eliminated. In this case, the analytes were driven toward the outlet of the separation capillary by the pressurized flow, the electric field force and minute electroosmotic flow, and they were separated owing to the electrophoretic mobility. The p-CE system allows for the independent variation of the pressurized flow rate and electrical field and electrophoretic separation of good repeatability (below 3%) under high electrical fields (500-1000 V cm(-1)) and flow rate gradient modes. The feasibility of the p-CE system in real analysis was demonstrated by iodate quantification in iodized table salts. The separation of iodide and iodate was realized within 0.3 min, proving its high analytical speed.

The corresponding closed-forms for unapertured case, the far held expression and the scalar paraxial result are also given as special cases of the general formulae. By using the derived formulae, some numerical examples are given to illustrate the nonparaxial propagation properties of a vectorial off-axis AHB through a rectangular aperture. It is shown that the f parameter, the off-axis displacement and the truncation parameter all play an important role in determining nonparaxial propagation behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The key lightweight feature of the method is that it can generate plausible wrinkles using a single low-cost Kinect camera and one high quality 3D face model with details as the example. Our method works in two stages: (1) offline personalized wrinkled blendshape construction. User-specific expressions are recorded using the RGB-Depth camera, and the wrinkles are generated through example-based synthesis of geometric details. (2) Online 3D facial performance capturing. These reconstructed expressions are used as blendshapes to capture facial animations in real-time. Experiments on a variety of facial performance videos show that our method can produce plausible results, approximating the wrinkles in an accurate way. Furthermore, our technique is low-cost and convenient for common users. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Liu, FC; Martin, T; Yeung, SK; Gross, M				Liu, Fuchang; Martin, Tobias; Yeung, Sai-Kit; Gross, Markus			Efficient direct rendering of deforming surfaces via shared subdivision trees	COMPUTER-AIDED DESIGN			English	Article						Isosurface visualization; GPU rendering; Computational geometry and object modeling	VISUALIZATION; ACCURATE; ELEMENTS; SYSTEM	In this paper, we present a subdivision-based approach to rasterize implicit surfaces embedded in volumetric Bezier patches undergoing a nonlinear deformation. Subdividing a given patch into simpler patches to perform the surface rasterization task is numerically robust, and allows guaranteeing visual accuracy even in the presence of geometric degeneracies. However, due to its memory requirements and slow convergence rates, subdivision is challenging to be used in an interactive environment. Unlike previous methods employing subdivision, our approach is based on the idea where for a given patch only one subdivision tree is maintained and shared among pixels. Furthermore, as the geometry of the object changes from frame to frame, a flexible data structure is proposed to manage the geometrically varying Bezier patches. The resulting algorithm is general and maps well to parallel computing platforms such as CUDA. We demonstrate on a variety of representative graphics and visualization examples that our GPU scheme scales well and achieves up to real-time performance on consumer-level graphics cards by guaranteeing visual accuracy.

Correlation-Induced Self-Doping in the Iron-Pnictide Superconductor Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							DOPED BAFE2AS2; LAYERS	The electronic structure of the iron-based superconductor Ba2Ti2Fe2As4O (T-c(onset) = 23.5 K) has been investigated by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and combined local density approximation and dynamical mean field theory calculations. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by both the Fe 3d and Ti 3d orbitals, indicating that the spacer layers separating different FeAs layers are also metallic. By counting the enclosed volumes of the Fermi surface sheets, we observe a large self-doping effect; i.e., 0.25 electrons per unit cell are transferred from the FeAs layer to the Ti2As2O layer, leaving the FeAs layer in a hole-doped state. This exotic behavior is successfully reproduced by our dynamical mean field calculations, in which the self-doping effect is attributed to the electronic correlations in the 3d shells. Our work provides an alternative route of effective doping without element substitution for iron-based superconductors.

J	Wang, ZG; Theeuwes, J				Wang, Zhiguo; Theeuwes, Jan			Distractor Evoked Deviations of Saccade Trajectory Are Modulated by Fixation Activity in the Superior Colliculus: Computational and Behavioral Evidence	PLOS ONE			English	Article							OCULOMOTOR INHIBITION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; COMPETITIVE INTEGRATION; REMOTE DISTRACTORS; TARGET SELECTION; TIME-COURSE; CURVATURE; INITIATION; SIGNALS; SYSTEM	Previous studies have shown that saccades may deviate towards or away from task irrelevant visual distractors. This observation has been attributed to active suppression (inhibition) of the distractor location unfolding over time: early in time inhibition at the distractor location is incomplete causing deviation towards the distractor, while later in time when inhibition is complete the eyes deviate away from the distractor. In a recent computational study, Wang, Kruijne and Theeuwes proposed an alternative theory that the lateral interactions in the superior colliculus (SC), which are characterized by short-distance excitation and long-distance inhibition, are sufficient for generating both deviations towards and away from distractors. In the present study, we performed a meta-analysis of the literature, ran model simulations and conducted two behavioral experiments to further explore this unconventional theory. Confirming predictions generated by the model simulations, the behavioral experiments show that a) saccades deviate towards close distractors and away from remote distractors, and b) the amount of deviation depends on the strength of fixation activity in the SC, which can be manipulated by turning off the fixation stimulus before or after target onset (Experiment 1), or by varying the eccentricity of the target and distractor (Experiment 2).

This study aimed to investigate population histories and refugia during the Last Glacial Maximum of two sympatric Eremias lizards (E. argus and E. brenchleyi) inhabiting northern China. We sequenced partial mitochondrial DNA from the ND4 gene for 128 individuals of E. argus from nine localities, and 46 individuals of E. brenchleyi from five localities. Forty-four ND4 haplotypes were determined from E. argus samples, and 33 from E. brenchleyi samples. Population expansion events began about 0.0044 Ma in E. argus, and 0.031 Ma in E. brenchleyi. The demographic history of E. brenchleyi indicates a long-lasting population decline since the most recent common ancestor, while that of E. argus indicates a continuous population growth. Among-population structure was significant in both species, and there were multiple refugia across their range. Intermittent gene flow occurred among expanded populations across multiple refugia during warmer phases of the glacial period, and this may explain why the effective population size has remained relatively stable in E. brenchleyi and grown in E. argus.

Forty-two adult females larger than 500 mm SVL and 32 adult males larger than 400 mm SVL were donated by local people in Ledong, Hainan under permit to our laboratory in Hainan in 2013 and 2014. The largest male and female measured 745 and 755 mm SVL, respectively. The mean SVL was greater in adult females than in adult males. Males had larger heads (head width) than females of the same SVL. The smallest reproductive female in our sample was 565 mm SVL. Females produced a single clutch of 17.1 (10-23) pliable-shelled eggs per breeding season stretching from mid-June and mid-September. Clutch size and clutch mass were all positively related to female SVL. However, there was no significant linear relationship between egg mass and female SVL. Larger females generally produced more eggs, and thus heavier clutches than did smaller ones. There was no significant linear relationship between relative clutch mass and female SVL. Phylogenetic generalized least squares (PGLS) analysis, accounting for phylogenetic relationships, showed that clutch size was positively correlated with mean maternal SVL in varanid lizards. PGLS analysis showed that phylogenetic relationships did not affect clutch (or/and egg) mass and the SVL although there were significant linear relationship between clutch (or/and egg) mass and mean maternal SVL. Therefore, we could draw some general conclusions about the body size and reproductive tactics in varanid lizards that larger females generally produced more eggs, larger eggs and thus heavier clutches than did smaller ones.

In this study, we measured samples of unhatched and hatched eggshells of the Chinese cobra Naja atra to determine the percentage of ash and the phase composition of calcium carbonate. The mean percentage of ash was significantly higher in unhatched eggshells (24.6%) than in hatched eggshells (22.3%). The dominant phase in unhatched eggshells was the calcite form of calcium carbonate. In addition to the peaks of calcite, a few small peaks were found to be caused by the aragonite and vaterite phases of calcium carbonate, implying that there are small amounts of aragonite and vaterite in the eggshell. The concentration of the various phases calculated from the intensity of the X-ray diffraction spectra allowed the estimation that percentages of calcite, aragonite and vaterite were about 92%, 4% and 4%, respectively. Hatched eggshells produced similar spectral characteristics as unhatched eggshells, with one exception. The dominant phase composition in the hatched eggshell was also calcite, but the amount of the aragonite phase had a marked increase. Our study adds evidence that embryonic mobilization of minerals from the eggshell may result in changes in structure of the eggshell.

Pharmacological interference of intracellular pro-inflammatory signaling may confer a therapeutic benefit under these conditions. Daphnetin, a natural coumarin derivative, has been used to treat inflammatory diseases including bronchitis. However, the protective effect of daphnetin in inflammatory airway disorders has yet to be determined, and the molecular basis for its anti-inflammatory properties is unknown. This paper shows that daphnetin treatment conferred substantial protection from endotoxin-induced acute lung injury (ALI), in parallel with reductions in the production of inflammatory mediators, symptoms of airway response, and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Further studies indicate that activation of macrophage and human alveolar epithelial cells in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was remarkably suppressed by daphnetin, which was related to the down-regulation of NF-kappa B-dependent signaling events. Importantly, this study demonstrates that TNF-alpha-induced protein 3 (TNFAIP3), also known as A20, was significantly induced by daphnetin, which appeared to be largely responsible for the down-regulation of NF-kappa B activity through modulation of nondegradative TRAF6 ubiquitination. Accordingly, the deletion of TNFAIP3 in primary macrophages reversed daphnetin-elicited inhibition of immune response, and the beneficial effect of daphnetin in the pathogenesis of ALI was, partially at least, abrogated by TNFAIP3 knockdown. These findings demonstrate the anti-inflammatory and protective functions of daphnetin in endotoxin-induced lung inflammation and injury and also reveal the key mechanism underlying its action in vitro as well as in vivo.

PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BESIII; FACTORIES; PHYSICS; QUARK	Using a sample of 2.25 x 10(8) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider, we search for the J/psi semileptonic weak decay J/psi -> D-s(-) e(+)nu(e) +c.c. with a much higher sensitivity than previous searches. We also perform the first search for J/psi -> D-s(*-) e(+) nu(e) + c.c. No significant excess of a signal above background is observed in either channel. At the 90% confidence level, the upper limits are determined to be B(J/psi -> D-s(-) e(+) nu(e) + c.c.) < 1.3 x 10(-6) and B(J/psi -> D-s*(-) e(+) nu(e) + c.c.) < 1.8 x 10(-6), respectively. Both are consistent with Standard Model predictions.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; An, F. F.; Bai, J. Z.; Cai, X.; Cao, G. F.; Chang, J. F.; Chen, G.; Chen, H. S.; Chen, J. C.; Chen, M.

Saccharide-Functionalized Organoplatinum(II) Metallacycles	ORGANOMETALLICS			English	Article							COORDINATION; DISCRETE; GLYCOMICS; COMPLEXES; BINDING; DESIGN; LECTIN; NANOSTRUCTURES; GLYCOPOLYMERS; ARCHITECTURES	Coordination-driven self-assembly can be used to construct metallacycles decorated with saccharide functionalities by combining organoplatinum acceptor building blocks with glycosylated dipyridyl donors. We describe here the synthesis of a suite of donors encoded with 120 degrees directionality. The 1,3-bis(pyridin-4-ylethynyl)benzene cores contain one of four pendant saccharide groups, resulting in a glucose-, galactose-, mannose-, and lactose-variant. The angularity of these donors makes them suitable for the self-assembly of [2 + 2] rhomboids and [3 + 3] hexagons containing two and three saccharide groups on combination with a 60 or 120 degrees acceptor, respectively. The synthesis and characterization of eight such metallacycles are described, supported by multinuclear NMR and electrospray mass spectrometry data that confirm clean, highly symmetric products with the expected stoichiometries of formation. This work illustrates the use of coordination-driven self-assembly to obtain nanoscopic metallacycles with biologically relevant functionalities in high yields and facile synthetic methods.

The present catalytic system exhibited excellent enantioselectivity and a broad substrate scope for indanone-derived beta-ketoamides under mild conditions (up to 99% ee and 99% yields). Notably, the biomimetic salan-copper complex was demonstrated for the first time to be a highly efficient catalyst in the fluorination of beta-ketoamides. Experimental results and mechanistic studies indicated that both excess amount of copper salt and electrophilic attack of cationic fluorine to activated methylene assisted by amide group on the beta-ketoamides were key factors for high yield and excellent enantioselectivity, respectively, in this enantioselective fluorination, which was controlled by the two-point binding between the salan-copper complex with cyclic beta-ketoamides and hydrogen-bonding activation of the electrophilic fluorinating reagent.

Recently, significant beneficial effects of CPs on early alcoholic liver injury in rats and on acute alcoholic injury in mice were observed. To our knowledge, the present study is the first report showing that CPs supplementation has beneficial effects on lipid profile, oxidative stress and alcoholic liver injury in men with chronic alcohol consumption. Methods: A 9-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was conducted between September 2011 and August 2012 to assess the hepatoprotective effect of CPs. A total of 161 men were randomized to receive CPs (n = 53), whey protein (n = 54), or corn starch placebo (n = 54) at the same dose of 2 g twice daily. 146 participants completed the study. Serum lipid profile, serum markers of liver injury, oxidative stress and inflammation, and fatty liver based on the results of abdominal ultrasonography were assessed at the beginning and end of the intervention. Results: CPs supplementation (4 g/d) for 9 weeks significantly lowered serum levels or activities of total cholesterol, triglyceride, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, malondialdehyde and tumor necrosis factor-a, and significantly increased serum activities of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase, but the same dose of whey protein and corn starch (placebo) did not demonstrate these effects. Conclusions: Our results indicate that CPs may have protective effects on alcohol-induced liver damage via modulation of lipid metabolism and oxidative stress. CPs may potentially be used as a functional food for the management of alcoholic liver disease in subjects with chronic alcohol consumption.

In particular, new items will be overlooked, impeding the development of new products online. Given limited resources, how to utilize the knowledge of recommender systems and design efficient marketing strategy for new items is extremely important. In this paper, we convert this ticklish issue into a clear mathematical problem based on a bipartite network representation. Under the most widely used algorithm in real e-commerce recommender systems, the so-called item-based collaborative filtering, we show that to simply push new items to active users is not a good strategy. Interestingly, experiments on real recommender systems indicate that to connect new items with some less active users will statistically yield better performance, namely, these new items will have more chance to appear in other users' recommendation lists. Further analysis suggests that the disassortative nature of recommender systems contributes to such observation. In a word, getting in-depth understanding on recommender systems could pave the way for the owners to popularize their cold-start products with low costs.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are key regulators of aging and cellular senescence in eukaryotes. Here, to help understand their biological role in rice leaf senescence, we report identification of miRNAs and their putative target genes by deep sequencing of six small RNA libraries, six RNA-seq libraries and two degradome libraries from the leaves of two super hybrid rice, Nei-2-You 6 (N2Y6, age-resistant rice) and Liang-You-Pei 9 (LYP9, age-sensitive rice). In total 372 known miRNAs, 162 miRNA candidates and 1145 targets were identified. Compared with the expression of miRNAs in the leaves of LYP9, the numbers of miRNAs up-regulated and down-regulated in the leaves of N2Y6 were 47 and 30 at early stage of grain-filling, 21 and 17 at the middle stage, and 11 and 37 at the late stage, respectively. Six miRNA families, osa-miR159, osa-miR160 osa-miR164, osa-miR167, osa-miR172 and osa-miR1848, targeting the genes encoding APETALA2 (AP2), zinc finger proteins, salicylic acid-induced protein 19 (SIP19), auxin response factors (ARF) and NAC transcription factors, respectively, were found to be involved in leaf senescence through phytohormone signaling pathways. These results provided valuable information for understanding the miRNA-mediated leaf senescence of rice, and offered an important foundation for rice breeding.

Electronic literature databases were searched to identify eligible studies published before Jun, 2014. The association was assessed by the odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI). The publication bias was explored using Begg's test. Sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the stability of the crude results. A total of 35 studies were included in this meta-analysis. For the MTHFR C677T polymorphism, we detected significant association in all genetic models for Asian children and the maternal population. Significant association was also detected in T vs. C for a Caucasian paediatric population (OR51.163, 95% CI: 1.008-1.342) and in both T vs. C (OR = 51.125, 95% CI: 1.043-1.214) and the dominant model (OR = 51.216, 95% CI: b1.096-1.348) for a Caucasian maternal population. For the MTHFR A1298C polymorphism, the association was detected in CC vs. AC for the Caucasian paediatric population (OR = 51.484, 95% CI: 1.035-2.128). Our results support the MTHFR -677T allele as a susceptibility factor for CHD in the Asian maternal population and the -1298C allele as a risk factor in the Caucasian paediatric population.

In this study, to develop an edible, safe, low-cost vaccine for AD, a cholera toxin B subunit (CTB)-A beta 42 fusion protein was successfully expressed in silkworm pupae. We tested the silkworm pupae-derived oral vaccination containing CTB-A beta 42 in a transgenic mouse model of AD. Anti-A beta 42 antibodies were induced in these mice, leading to a decreased A beta deposition in the brain. We also found that the oral administration of the silk worm pupae vaccine improved the memory and cognition of mice, as assessed using a water maze test. These results suggest that the new edible CTB-A beta 42 silkworm pupae-derived vaccine has potential clinical application in the prevention of AD.

In this study, the changes in pressure gradients between the two cerebral hemispheres were investigated after hemorrhagic stroke of one side, and after a craniotomy. Methods: Twenty-four patients with acute cerebral hemorrhages and intracerebral hematomas who exhibited mass effect and midline shift to the contralateral side on computed tomography were selected for this study. After admission, both sides of the cranium were drilled, and optical fiber sensors were implanted to monitor the brain parenchyma pressure (BPP) in both cerebral hemispheres. All patients underwent surgical hematoma evacuations. The preoperative and postoperative BPP data from both cerebral hemispheres were collected at various time points and compared pairwise. Results: There were statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) in the preoperative BPP values between the two hemispheres at three different time points. Differences in the BPP values between the two hemispheres at the time of surgery, and 24 and 48 h after surgery, were not statistically significant (P > 0.05). The posteroperative BPPs of both hemispheres were statistically significantly lower than preoperative recordings. Conclusions: BPP sensors should be applied to the injured cerebral hemisphere, because this becomes the source of increased ICP. Hematoma evacuation surgery effectively decreases ICP and eliminates pressure gradients between the two cerebral hemispheres, consequently enabling brain shift correction.

Sinalliaria differs from the related genus Orychophragmus in having basal leaves petiolate, simple or rarely with 1-3 lateral lobes (not pinnatisect); cauline leaves petiolate, cordate at base (not sessile, auriculate or amplexicaul at base); petals obovate to narrowly obovate, claw inconspicuous (not broadly obovate, with a claw as along as sepal); siliques truncate (not long-beaked) at apex. The microscopic characters of seed testa also show significant differences between Sinalliaria and Orychophragmus. Phylogenetic evidence from DNA sequences of nuclear ribosomal ITS and plastid region trnL-trnF indicates that Sinalliaria is a distinct group related to Orychophragmus and Raphanus, but these three genera do not form a clade. The new genus Sinalliaria is endemic to eastern China and has only one species and one variety. The new combinations, S. limprichtiana (Pax) X. F. Jin, Y. Y. Zhou & H. W. Zhang and S. limprichtiana var. grandifolia (Z. X. An) X. F. Jin, Y. Y. Zhou & H. W. Zhang are proposed here.

In order to clarify the mechanism of ALI, we, therefore, studied the operative course of a group of patients who underwent elective esophagectomy. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed 75 patients underwent an esophagectomy and reconstruction for thoracic esophageal cancer. Results: No statistically significant differences were observed between the two groups regarding their clinical backgrounds, such as their age, smoking index, preoperative pulmonary function, the location of the main tumor, and the tumor nodes metastasis stage. Operative time is thus considered to be a significant factor. The odds ratio (OR) of ALI in cases whose preoperative pulmonary function was 6.70 in comparison to the abnormal preoperative pulmonary functions. The OR for more intraoperative bleeding (> 1000 g) was 0.83, compared with a lesser intraoperative bleeding although the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.076). Anastomotic leakage occurred in four patients (44%) in Group I while it only occurred in two patient (6%) among the 33 Group II patients (P = 0.011). Conclusion: Greater surgical stress, such as a longer operative time, is thus considered to be associated with the first attack of ALI. The adverse events developing in the extrathoracic site, such as necrosis and local infection around anastomosis may, therefore, be the second attack. Furthermore, ALI may cause not only systemic inflammatory response syndrome but also other complications such as anastomotic leakage.

A 'Neurophenomenal Resting State Hypothesis'	CLINICAL PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						Hallucinations; Schizophrenia; Intrinsic activity; Auditory cortex	VERBAL HALLUCINATIONS; NONPSYCHOTIC INDIVIDUALS; SCHIZOPHRENIA-PATIENTS; DEFAULT NETWORK; CONNECTIVITY; SPEECH; HYPERACTIVITY; ACTIVATION; RELEVANCE; SYMPTOMS	While several hypotheses about the neural mechanisms underlying auditory verbal hallucinations (AVH) have been suggested, the exact role of the recently highlighted intrinsic resting state activity of the brain remains unclear. Based on recent findings, we therefore developed what we call the 'resting state hypotheses' of AVH. Our hypothesis suggest that AVH may be traced back to abnormally elevated resting state activity in auditory cortex itself, abnormal modulation of the auditory cortex by anterior cortical midline regions as part of the default mode network, and neural confusion between auditory cortical resting state changes and stimulus induced activity. We discuss evidence in favour of our 'resting state hypothesis' and show its correspondence with phenomenal, i.e., subjective experiential features as explored in phenomenological accounts. Therefore I speak of a 'neurophenomenal resting state hypothesis' of auditory hallucinations in schizophrenia.

Using fMRI and a variant of the ultimatum game and functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated how the brain differentially responds to fairness in loss and gain domains. Participants (responders) received offers from anonymous partners indicating a division of an amount of monetary gain or loss. If they accept, both get their shares according to the division; if they reject, both get nothing or lose the entire stake. We used a computational model to derive perceived fairness of offers and participant-specific inequity aversion. Behaviorally, participants were more likely to reject unfair offers in the loss (vs gain) domain. Neurally, the positive correlation between fairness and activation in ventral striatum was reduced, whereas the negative correlations between fairness and activations in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were enhanced in the loss domain. Moreover, rejection-related dorsal striatum activation was higher in the loss domain. Furthermore, the gain-loss domain modulates costly punishment only when unfair behavior was directed toward the participants and not when it was directed toward others. These findings provide neural and computational accounts of increased costly norm enforcement under adversity and advanced our understanding of the context-dependent nature of fairness preference.

JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL BOTANY			English	Article						Arabidopsis thaliana; Argonaute; cleavage; degradome; microRNA; small RNA; target	MICRORNAS; PROTEINS; SERVER; ROLES	To maintain normal growth and development in a plant, gene expression must be under strict surveillance. One of the post-transcriptional regulatory pathways involves small RNA (sRNA)-guided, Argonaute (AGO) protein complex-mediated target cleavages. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are the well-known sRNA species participating in the cleavage-based regulation of gene expression. In plants, most miRNAs are incorporated into AGO1-associated silencing complexes. Thus, the AGO1 protein is considered to be the most important slicer for sRNA-mediated target cleavages. Previous phylogenetic analysis revealed that AGO1, AGO5, and AGO10 belonged to the same clade in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). In addition, experimental evidence pointed to the possibility that AGO2, AGO7, and AGO10 were implicated in specific miRNA-mediated regulatory pathways. To investigate the potential slicer activities of AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, a comprehensive search was performed for the sRNAs enriched in the four AGO proteins in Arabidopsis. A total of 3 499, 1 618, 4 632, and 63 sRNAs are enriched in AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10, respectively. Interestingly, several miRNAs were found to be enriched in AGO2 or AGO5. Transcriptome-wide target identification based on degradome sequencing data uncovered that a number of sRNAs enriched in the four AGOs could perform target cleavages like AGO1-associated miRNAs in plants. Based on the above results, the opinion was put forward that not only AGO1, but also AGO2, AGO5, AGO7, and AGO10 might be essential for the sRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression in plants.

Batch assays were used to demonstrate the enhancement of the SAA upon the addition of Cu2+, Ni2+ and Fe3+. The SAA was enhanced by 41.0% when the Cu2+ concentration was below 1 mg L-1, while it was improved by 63.5% at Ni2+ concentrations below 1.74 mg L-1. An enhancement of 533.2% was obtained when 3.68 mg L-1 Fe3+ was supplied. The effects of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ on the SAA were analyzed and optimized by a response surface methodology, which demonstrated that the interaction between Fe3+ and Cu2+ was significant and that 6.61 mg Fe3+ L-1, 1.18 mg Cu2+ L-1 and 1.11 mg Ni2+ L-1 were the optimal values for metal dosing. Subsequently, an Fe3+-Cu2+-Ni2+ continuous test was carried out under optimal conditions and revealed that the addition of Fe3+, Cu2+ and Ni2+ could stimulate the reactor potential at ambient temperature. The maximum nitrogen removal rate (NRR) of the test reactor was 52.8% higher than that of the control reactor (8.1 versus 5.3 kg N m(-3) d(-1)). Moreover, a continuous test conducted by adding Fe3+ achieved an average nitrogen removal efficiency and maximum NRR of 67.4% and 4.9 kg N m(-3) d(-1), respectively, while the corresponding values of the control test were 64.7% and 4.1 kg N m(-3) d(-1), respectively. Altogether, appropriate dosages of Cu2+, Ni2+ and Fe3+ can significantly enhance the SAA and improve the reactor capacity at ambient temperature. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

With stable cell cycle arrests, cellular senescence has been mostly studied in the adult tissues of mammals. In the present study, we report widespread cellular senescence within certain time windows of late-phase normal development of mouse embryos. Using in situ senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-gal) staining, we showed SA-beta-gal activity in selected cell populations of the brain, stomach, interdigital webs, tail, ear, limbs and nasal mouth area on gestation day 14.5 of the mouse embryos. On day 18.5 of gestation, selected cells in the intestines and bone developmental areas showed SA-beta-gal activity. The chondrocytes in ossification zones were significantly marked by the activities of SA-beta-gal, p21, p15 and Hp1Y, suggesting activation of the cell cycle checkpoint by the p53 and Rb pathways, and development of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Throughout gestation days 14.5-18.5, the trophoblast cells in the labyrinth layer of the placentas also showed strong activities of SA-beta-gal, p53 and p21. Increased expressions of p19, p16 and Rb of the p16/Rb pathway, and reduced expressions of Ki67 were also observed in the placentas. Taken together, the present findings suggest that cellular senescence represents an essential mechanism at multiple sites including the fetal bone forming zones and placenta during mammalian embryonic development, playing potential roles in the full embryonic development of tissue growth and organ formation.

Retinal-derived fluorophores that accumulate as RPE lipofuscin are implicated in pathological mechanisms of AMD. One component of RPE lipofuscin has been characterized as pdA2E, a pyridinium adduct derived from all-trans-retinal and excess ethanolamine. Onestep preparation and biosynthetic studies of pdA2E and its novel isomer called isopdA2E are reported. METHODS. Biosynthetic reaction mixtures, RPE/choroids and neural retinas dissected from bovines, eyes harvested from Abca4(-/-)Rdh8(-/)-mice, irradiated samples, and enzymetreated solutions were analyzed by HPLC, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, fluorescence spectrophotometry, and density functional theory (DFT). RESULTS. Optimization of the in vitro synthesis of pdA2E resulted in a biomimetic preparation of this pigment in a yield of 15%; this protocol also allowed the identification of isopdA2E, a double-bond isomer of pdA2E at the C13C14 position in bovine RPE lipofuscin. Interconversion between these two molecules occurs when either pdA2E or isopdA2E is exposed to light. A phospholipase D-based assay demonstrated the possibility of pdA2-PE being formed in neural retina and served as a precursor of pdA2E in the biosynthetic pathway. DFT calculations revealed that the 492-nm absorbance was assigned to the long arm of pdA2E/isopdA2E and the 340/342-nm absorbance to the short arm. Fluorescence efficiency of pdA2E and isopdA2E is very similar, but is much weaker in comparison with A2E, isoA2E, and iisoA2E. CONCLUSIONS. Our results facilitate the understanding of compositions and biosynthetic pathways of adverse RPE lipofuscin.

Recently, the whole AMIDAS package and website system has been upgraded to the second phase: AMIDAS-II, for including the new developed Bayesian analysis technique. AMIDAS has the ability to do full Monte Carlo simulations as well as to analyze real/pseudo data sets either generated by another event generating programs or recorded in direct DM detection experiments. Moreover, the AMIDAS-II package can include several "user-defined" functions into the main code: the (fitting) one-dimensional WIMP velocity distribution function, the nuclear form factors for spin-independent and spin-dependent cross sections, artificial/experimental background spectrum for both of simulation and data analysis procedures, as well as different distribution functions needed in Bayesian analyses.

To examine whether incubation temperature fluctuation has a key role in influencing the phenotype of hatchling Chinese skinks (Plestiodon chinensis), we incubated.eggs produced by 20 females under five thermal regimes (treatments). Eggs in three treatments were incubated in three incubators, one set constant at 27 degrees C and two ramp-programmed at 27 +/- 3 degrees C and 27 +/- 5 degrees C on a cycle of 12 h (+) and 12 h (-). The remaining eggs were incubated in two chambers: one inside a room where temperatures varied from 23.0 to 31.1 degrees C, with a mean of 27.0 degrees C; the other outside the room where temperatures varied from 20.2 to 35.3 degrees C, with a mean of 26.1 degrees C. We found that: (1) for eggs at a given embryonic stage at ovipositon, the mean rather than the variance of incubation temperatures determined the length of incubation; (2) most (egg mass, embryonic stage at oviposition, incubation length and all examined hatchling traits except tail length and locomotor performance) of the examined variables were affected by clutch; and (3) body mass was the only hatchling trait that differed among the five treatments, but the differences were tiny. These findings suggest that incubation temperature fluctuation has no direct role in influencing incubation length and hatchling phenotype in P. chinensis. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The tight focusing properties of a partially coherent AHB, including the degree of polarization, the intensity distribution, and the degree of coherence, are studied in detail. It is found that the focusing properties of a partially coherent AHB are closely determined by the initial coherence, initial beam parameters, and NA of the thin lens. However, no matter how high the value of eccentricity, the initial beam will reduce to a Gaussian beam of quasi-circular symmetry at the focal plane. No matter the value of NA, the size of the beam will remain invariant, which is an interesting phenomenon, and the beam has good stability. The results may find application in optical trapping with a partially coherent field.

PdCl2 and beta-cyclodextrin (CD) were used as starting materials. The beta-CD in this reaction was used as complexing reagent and carbon source. When Pd2+ was reduced to Pd by hydrogen reduction treatment, the complex effect of beta-CD would affect the aggregation of Pd nanoparticles. The electro-oxidation of methanol in alkaline medium was studied. The catalyst treated at 673 K showed better electrocatalytic activity and stability for methanol oxidation than that of 773 and 1073 K and commercial Pt/C electrocatalysts, which might be attributed to the high dispersion of Pd nanoparticles and special frame and properties of complexes.

The XRD characterization reveals that the crystal structures of the heteropentacenes can be significantly influenced by the methyl substitution. The optical and electrochemical properties were investigated and the experimental results confirm that the sible motif lowers the LUMO level of the heteropentacenes. Preliminary results show that the insertion of silole ring systems into rigid heteropentacenes leads to an improved solubility and high fluorescence quantum yield up to 0.74 in solution, which indicates the potential of these new silole-containing compounds for photonic and photoelectric applications. The strong and sensitive fluorescence quenching behavior towards picric acid (PA) demonstrates that the silole-containing heteropentacene derivatives are also promising fluorescent sensor materials for detecting the nitro-containing explosives.

In this paper, specimens of lap plates and several interference fit sizes were designed, and then the interference fit hi-lock bolt insertion was carried out in an experimental test. Using the commercial finite element software ABAQUS, a two-dimensional axisymmetric finite element model was established to simulate the bolt insertion process. The finite element model was validated by comparison of experimental results and finite element prediction for insertion force and protuberance height. After the interference fitted bolt insertion, the changing characteristics of the non-uniform hole expansion and protuberance were presented with increases in interference fit size. Under low level of interference fit, the tensile hoop stress was produced mainly on the hole wall, and changed into compressive hoop stress when interference fit size is larger. The maximum tensile hoop stress point on faying surfaces went away from the hole wall with interference fit size increasing.

Materials and methods: Using a 3.0 T magnetic resonance (MR) scanner, a population-based whole brain template was developed by averaging forty T1 images in the brains of postnatal piglets at 38 days of age. The templates for gray and white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid were designed based on the corresponding probability maps by adapting individual data sets using statistical parametric mapping. Anatomical labeling maps were generated from labeling propagation derived from the established Pig Brain Atlas. Differences in the coordinates from four significant structural landmarks in the template, plus an additional 12 normalized images and anatomical labeling maps were measured to validate the accuracy of the registration of the template. Results: A whole brain template, a set of tissue-specific probability and anatomical labeling maps were developed. The location deviation of the four significant structural landmarks, including the anterior and posterior regions in the corpus callosum, and the left and right caudate nucleus, was found to be <0.25 cm, validating the sensitivity and resolution of the template. Conclusion: A whole brain template map and a set of tissue-specific probability and anatomical labeling maps were developed to analyze the morphometric imaging of the postnatal piglet brain, an animal model of the human infant.

In the present study, we provide direct evidence for the cooccurrence of the anammox and n-damo processes in a flooded paddy field in southeastern China. Stable isotope experiments showed that the potential anammox rates ranged from 5.6 to 22.7 nmol N-2 g(-1) (dry weight) day(-1) and the potential n-damo rates varied from 0.2 to 2.1 nmolCO(2) g(-1) (dry weight) day(-1) in different layers of soil cores. Quantitative PCR showed that the abundance of anammox bacteria ranged from 1.0 x 105 to 2.0 x10(6) copies g(-1) (dry weight) in different layers of soil cores and the abundance of n-damo bacteria varied from 3.8 x 10(5) to 6.1 x 10(6) copies g(-1) (dry weight). Phylogenetic analyses of the recovered 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that anammox bacteria affiliated with "Candidatus Brocadia" and "Candidatus Kuenenia" and n-damo bacteria related to "Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera"were present in the soil cores. It is estimated that a total loss of 50.7 g Nm(-2) per year could be linked to the anammox process, which is at intermediate levels for the nitrogen flux ranges of aerobic ammonium oxidation and denitrification reported in wetland soils. In addition, it is estimated that a total of 0.14 g CH4 m(- 2) per year could be oxidized via the n-damo process, while this rate is at the lower end of the aerobic methane oxidation rates reported in wetland soils.

J	Li, M; Liu, RR; Jia, CX; Wang, BH				Li, Ming; Liu, Run-Ran; Jia, Chun-Xiao; Wang, Bing-Hong			Cascading failures on networks with asymmetric dependence	EPL			English	Article							INTERNET	Networks with mutual dependence have been shown to be much more vulnerable to random failures and targeted attacks than those without. However, in real networks, the dependence between two nodes is not always mutual. Periphery nodes may depend on hub nodes, yet the converse is not necessarily true. Considering this asymmetric dependence, we propose a model of cascading dynamics of networks, where the dependence between nodes is determined by their degrees. We find that the asymmetric dependence makes networks more robust than the symmetric one, and the percolation transition point is not sensitive to the number of the asymmetric dependence nodes. Furthermore, scale-free networks with asymmetric dependence can still be very robust to random failures, rather than extremely fragile as the one with mutual dependence. We also develop an approach to analyse this model and obtain the exact solutions for the size of the giant component and the critical point. Both simulation and analytical results reveal the existence of the crossover between the first- and the second-order percolation transitions in our model.

Different reaction condition factors, including acyl agent, solvent, reaction temperature, and the concentration of Et3N, were optimized in order to establish the optimal reaction conditions for the enzymatic kinetic resolution of secondary amines. It was demonstrated that acyl agent, the concentration of Et3N or the type of solvent have a greater influence on the selectivity and rate of the asymmetric acylation reaction in the process of the enzymatic resolution, respectively. The target product amine was obtained in good conversion (49%) and an excellent degree of enantiomeric purity (>99%) when Candida antarctica lipase B (CAL-B) and phenyl allyl carbonates were combined to use in the tert-butyl methyl ether (TBME) medium. This method will be an alternative to the traditional route for producing the optically pure intermediate of moxifloxacin. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This prospective HIPAA-complaint study was approved by our institutional review board. Eighty HD ESRD patients and 80 sexand age-matched healthy controls were included. Neuropsychological (NP) tests and laboratory tests, including serum creatinine and urea, were performed. DTI data were processed to obtain fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) maps with TBSS. FA and MD difference between the 2 groups were compared. We also explored the associations of FA values in WM regions of lower FA with ages, NP tests, disease, and dialysis durations, serum creatinine and urea levels of ESRD patients. Compared with controls, HD ESRD patients had lower FA value in the corpus callosum, bilateral corona radiate, posterior thalamic radiation, left superior longitudinal fasciculus, and right cingulum (P < 0.05, FWE corrected). Almost all WM regions had increased MD in HD ESRD patients compared with controls (P < 0.05, FWE corrected). In some regions with lower FA, FA values showed moderate correlations with ages, NP tests, and serum urea levels. There was no correlation between FA values and HD durations, disease durations, and serum creatinine levels of ESRD patients (all P > 0.05). Diffuse interstitial brain edema and moderate WM integrity disruption occurring in HD ESRD patients, which correlated with cognitive dysfunction, and serum urea levels might be a risk factor for these WM changes.

The morphological investigation shows that Ag nanoparticles are mainly located on the surface of TiO2 nano-supports because of the fast reduction rate of Ag ions by hydrazine. Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites with amorphous or anatase TiO2 phase displayed high visible-light catalytic activity for degradation of Rhodamine B. The photoactivity of Ag/anatase TiO2 nanocomposites could be influenced by the Ag content that could be conveniently tuned by the loading of silver salts. The influence of the loading of silver salts on the particle properties of the Ag/TiO2 nanocomposites was investigated systematically. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The complexes feature a tridentate citrate, malate or citramalate that chelates to vanadium atom through their alpha-hydroxy, alpha-carboxy and beta-carboxy groups; while the other beta-carboxylic acidic group of citrate is free to participate strong hydrogen bonds with lattice water molecule. The neutral alpha-hydroxy group also forms strong intermolecular hydrogen bonds with water molecule and the negatively-charged alpha-carboxy group in the environment. The inclusion of a hydrogen ion in alpha-alkoxy group results in the formation of a series of neutral complexes with one less positive charge. There are two different configurations of citrate with respect to the trans-position of axial oxo group, where the complex with trans-hydroxy configuration seems more stable with less hindrance. The average bond distances of V-O-hydroxy and V-O alpha-carboxy are 2.196 and 2.003 angstrom respectively, which are comparable to the V-O distance (2.15 angstrom) of homocitrate in FeV-cofactor of V-nitrogenase. A new structural model is suggested for R-homocitrato iron vanadium cofactor as VFe7S9C(R-Hhomocit) (H(4)homocit = homocitric acid) with one more proton in homocitrate ligand. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Phosphotungstic acid (H3PW12O40) and selenium powder are used as W and Se sources, respectively. The phosphotungstic acid precursor is impregnated inside the template and converted to WSe2 by H2Se, which is formed inside the tube furnace by the reaction between Se and H-2 gas flow. The mesoporous WSe2 product has a highly ordered mesostructure and possesses rod-like particle morphology. The mesoporous WSe2 material displays good electrochemical properties with high reversible capacity (530 mA h/g) and stable cycling performance. The results suggest that the mesoporous WSe2 material may be a promising candidate for reversible storage of lithium ions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were employed to investigate the microscopic properties of non-ionic fluorocarbon surfactants at the air/water interface. Several properties, including the distribution of head groups, the distribution probability of the tilt angle between hydrophobic tails with respect to the xy plane, and the order parameter of surfactants, were computed to probe the structure of hydrophobic surfactants at the air/water interface. The effects of the monomer structure on interfacial phenomena of non-ionic surfactants were investigated as well. It is observed that the structure of fluorocarbon surfactants at the air/water interface is more ordered than that of hydrocarbons, which is dominated by the van der Waals interaction between surfactants and water molecules. However, replacing one or two CF2 with one or two CH2 group does not significantly influence the interfacial structure, suggesting that hydrocarbons may be promising alternatives to perfluorinated surfactants.

By employing this ligand, three new coordination complexes were prepared under solvothermal conditions: {[Ni(PPC)(2)]center dot 3H(2)O}(n) (1), [Ag(PPC)](n) (2) and [Cd(PPC)Cl](n) (3). Single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses reveal that 1-3 exhibit three different structural types. Complex 1 displays a 4-connected net with the Schlafli symbol (4(4).6(2)) topology, several types of hydrogen bonds connect the 2-D layer to a 3-D structure. Complex 2 is built from [Ag(N2O)] clusters and PPC ligand as 3-connected linker with Schlafli symbol {3(6).4(6).5(3)}without consideration of Ag center dot center dot center dot Ag interaction. The 2-D networks are also linked to form 3 D framework via Ag center dot center dot center dot Ag interaction. Complex 3 can be regarded as a (3, 3)-connected net with the Schlafli symbol {3(33).4(33)} which consists of [Cd(N2O2)] clusters and PPC ligand as 3-connected bridge. The layers are further linked by the cholride atoms to generate a 3-D network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

After switching to ad libitum feeding, the turtles in R-AL group ate more food and grew faster than those in other groups. At the end of the trial, R-AL turtles achieved the comparable body weight as AL turtles, indicating that a complete CG response occurred. Cumulative food consumption over the entire period did not differ between R-AL turtles and AL turtles. Experimental treatment affected carcass composition. Carcass lipid content of AL turtles was greater than that of R and AL-R turtles, with R-AL turtles in between. Carcass protein content of R-AL turtles was slightly greater than that of other groups without statistical differences. Stored lipids might be consumed firstly when animals underwent food restriction. Our results reconfirmed the CG of C. reevesii after food restriction. However, it is still difficult to achieve a reduction in the cost of farm-raised turtle production by adopting a restricted-satiation feeding protocol.

This study aims to demonstrate whole-brain iron alterations and its clinical relevancies in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (mTLE) in vivo, using susceptibility-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (SWI). Methods: We studied 62 patients with mTLE and 62 healthy controls. Brain iron concentration was quantified using SWI phase values. Voxel-wise analysis was carried out to compare iron levels between mTLE and controls, and to assess the relationship between altered iron concentration and clinical parameters in mTLE. Results: Patients with mTLE showed decreases of iron levels in the subcortical structures such as substantia nigra, red nucleus, and basal ganglia. Conversely, iron levels were decreased in the cortex. Subcortical iron levels were negatively correlated to those in the cortex. Moreover, cortical and basal ganglia iron levels were related to clinical variables including epilepsy duration, age at seizures onset, and histories of precipitating factors. Conclusions: Our SWI findings suggest a redistribution of iron between subcortical and cortical structures in mTLE. The degree of redistribution is affected by both progression of epilepsy and precipitating factors. Investigation on brain iron redistribution offers new insights into the pathogenesis of mTLE, and may be a potential biomarker for monitoring the clinical progression of epilepsy.

In this work we report findings that the band structure of MoO3 can be significantly altered by a distortion in the octahedral coordination structure. We discovered that, in addition to epitaxial type of structural strain, chemical force such as hydrogen inclusion can also cause extended lattice distortion. The lattice distortion in hydrogenated MoO3 led to a significant reduction of the energy gap, overshadowing the Moss-Burstein effect of band filling. Charge doping simulations revealed that filling of conduction band drives the lattice distortion. This suggests that any charge transfer or n-type electron doping could lead to lattice distortion and consequentially a reduction in energy gap.

BESIII Collaboration	Observation of e(+)e(-) -> pi(0)pi(0)h(c) and a Neutral Charmoniumlike Structure Z(c)(4020)(0)	PHYSICAL REVIEW LETTERS			English	Article							Z(C)(3900)	Using data collected with the BESIII detector operating at the Beijing Electron Positron Collider at center-of-mass energies of root s = 4.23, 4.26, and 4.36 GeV, we observe e(+)e(-) -> pi(0)pi(0)h(c) for the first time. The Born cross sections are measured and found to be about half of those of e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)h(c) within less than 2 sigma. In the pi(0)h(c) mass spectrum, a structure at 4.02 GeV/c(2) is found. It is most likely to be the neutral isospin partner of the Z(c)(4020)(+/-) observed in the process of e(+)e(-) -> pi(+)pi(-)h(c) being found. A fit to the pi(0)h(c) invariant mass spectrum, with the width of the Z(c)(4020)(0) fixed to that of its charged isospin partner and possible interferences with non-Z(c)(4020)(0) amplitudes neglected, gives a mass of (4023.9 +/- 2.2 +/- 3.8) MeV/c(2) for the Z(c)(4020)(0), where the first error is statistical and the second systematic.

The anti-tumor activities for MDA-MB-231 of all these new compounds were screened in vitro by MTT assay. Due to the modification of gastrodin analogues, the anti-tumor activities of these 1,3,4-oxadiazoles derivatives were greatly improved. Six compounds (6c, 6d, 6i, 6j, 6k and 6l) displayed relatively higher MDA-MB-231 potency with IC50 values (0.89, 0.26, 1.35, 3.60, 0.95 and 1.08 mu M) compared with the reference medicine Rosiglitazone (5.23 mu M).

Most were proposed to be junior synonyms in the last revision of the genus. Using original material from China and data from GenBank, we investigate the biodiversity and phylogeny of Simocephalus using sequences of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and the nuclear 18S genes. In both cases, neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood and Bayesian inference analyses led to highly congruent tree topologies. The grouping of the deeper clades agrees with the inter-generic classification of Orlova-Bienkowskaja (2001). Only the populations of S. serrulatus from Eurasia and North America seem to be closely related, and there are no other shared species between the two continents. Our study unambiguously confirms the existence of many lineages from the subgenera of Simocephalus (Echinocaudus) and Simocephalus s.str. in China, but their morphology needs to be reexamined by taking a wider range of characters (e.g., of female thoracic limbs and adult males) into consideration.

PLOS ONE			English	Article							AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR; ACID-PHOSPHATASE; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR; CELL-DIVISION; STARVATION RESPONSE; ROOT DEVELOPMENT; GENE; EXPRESSION; MERISTEM	Background: Plant responses to phytohormone stimuli are the most important biological features for plants to survive in a complex environment. Cytokinin regulates growth and nutrient homeostasis, such as the phosphate (Pi) starvation response and Pi uptake in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying how cytokinin participates in Pi uptake and Pi signaling are largely unknown. In this study, we found that OsARF16 is required for the cytokinin response and is involved in the negative regulation of Pi uptake and Pi signaling by cytokinin. Principal Findings: The mutant osarf16 showed an obvious resistance to exogenous cytokinin treatment and the expression level of the OsARF16 gene was considerably up-regulated by cytokinin. Cytokinin (6-BA) application suppressed Pi uptake and the Pi starvation response in wild-type Nipponbare (NIP) and all these responses were compromised in the osarf16 mutant. Our data showed that cytokinin inhibits the transport of Pi from the roots to the shoots and that OsARF16 is involved in this process. The Pi content in the osarf16 mutant was much higher than in NIP under 6-BA treatment. The expressions of PHOSPHATE TRANSPORTER1 (PHT1) genes, phosphate (Pi) starvation-induced (PSI) genes and purple PAPase genes were higher in the osarf16 mutant than in NIP under cytokinin treatment. Conclusion: Our results revealed a new biological function for OsARF16 in the cytokinin-mediated inhibition of Pi uptake and Pi signaling in rice.

Using CHO-K1 cells stably expressing HCA(2) and A431 cells, a human epidermoid cell line with high levels of endogenous expression of functional HCA(2) receptors, we first demonstrated that niacin induced a robust Akt phosphorylation at both Thr(308) and Ser(473) in a time-dependent fashion, with a maximal activation at 5 min and a subsequent reduction to baseline by 30 min through HCA(2), and that the activation was significantly blocked by pertussis toxin. The HCA(2)-mediated activation of Akt was also significantly inhibited by the PKC inhibitors GF109203x and Go6983 in both cell lines, by the PDGFR-selective inhibitor tyrphostin A9 in CHO-HCA(2) cells and by the MMP inhibitor GM6001 and EGFR-specific inhibitor AG1478 in A431 cells. These results suggest that the PKC pathway and PDGFR/EGFR transactivation pathway play important roles in HCA(2)-mediated Akt activation. Further investigation indicated that PI3K and the G(beta gamma) subunit were likely to play an essential role in HCA(2)-induced Akt activation. Moreover, Immunobloting analyses using an antibody that recognizes p70S6K1 phosphorylated at Thr(389) showed that niacin evoked p70S6K1 activation via the PI3K/Akt pathway. The results of our study provide new insight into the signaling pathways involved in HCA(2) activation.

Its dried root contains a number of tanshinones, protocatechuic aldehyde, salvianolic acid B and rosmarinic, and is used for the treatment of various diseases. The finding of microRNAs (miRNAs) and their target genes will help understand their biological role on the biosynthesis of tanshinones in S. miltiorrhiza. In the present study, a total of 452 known miRNAs corresponding to 589 precursor miRNAs (pre-miRNAs), and 40 novel miRNAs corresponding to 24 pre-miRNAs were identified in different tissues of S. miltiorrhiza by high-throughput sequencing, respectively. Among them, 62 miRNAs express only in root, 95 miRNAs express only in stem, 19 miRNAs express only in leaf, and 71 miRNAs express only in flower, respectively. By the degradome analysis, 69 targets potentially cleaved by 25 miRNAs were identified. Among them, acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase was cleaved by miR5072, and involved in the biosynthesis of tanshinones. This study provided valuable information for understanding the tissue-specific expression patterns of miRNAs in S. miltiorrhiza, and offered a foundation for future studies of the miRNA-mediated biosynthesis of tanshinones.

BESIII Collaboration	Search for C-parity violation in J/psi -> gamma gamma and gamma phi	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article								Using 1.06 x 10(8) psi(3686) events recorded in e(+)e(-) collisions at root s = 3.686 GeV with the BESIII at the BEPCII collider, we present searches for C-parity violation in J/psi -> gamma gamma and gamma phi decays via psi(3686) -> J/psi pi(+)pi(-). No significant signals are observed in either channel. Upper limits on the branching fractions are set to be B(J/psi -> gamma gamma) < 2.7 x 10(-7) and B(J/psi -> gamma phi) < 1.4 x 10(-6) at the 90% confidence level. The former is one order of magnitude more stringent than the previous upper limit, and the latter represents the first limit on this decay channel.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X. C.; Amoroso, A.; An, F.

Identification and characterization of a new allele for ZEBRA LEAF 2, a gene encoding carotenoid isomerase in rice	SOUTH AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BOTANY			English	Article						Map-based cloning; Mutant; OsCRTISO	MAP-BASED CLONING; LEAF MUTANT-GENE; PHOTOPROTECTION	The Japonica rice cultivar 'Nipponbare' was mutagenized by ethyl methane sulfonate (EMS) to obtain a stable and heritable "zebra leaf' mutant zb2. Under natural conditions, yellow and green striped leaves appeared at the seedling stage of this mutant and the leaves gradually turned pale green towards the end of the tillering stage. Both temperature and illumination affected the traits of zb2 mutants. Compared with the wild type, concentrations of chlorophyll and carotenoid were significantly lower in zb2 mutants. Electron microscopic examination of the leaves revealed aberrant chloroplast structure in zb2 mutants. The zb2 mutant phenotype was found to be caused by recessive mutations in a single nuclear gene. By using map-based cloning, the target gene was mapped to a 111.9 kb region on chromosome 11. Sequencing analysis revealed a G to T mutation in exon 9 of the ZB2 gene in the mutant. This mutation transformed the 413th Glu residue in the mRNA to a stop codon, resulting in early termination of translation. The ZB2 gene encodes carotenoid isomerase, a key enzyme in carotenoid synthesis, was designated a new allele of OsCRTISO. These results indicated that zb2 is a new allele of Oscrtiso/phs3. Real-time fluorescence quantitative PCR revealed that expression of ZB2 was highest in the leaves compared to the other organs of wild type plants. Furthermore, ZB2 expression was found to be significantly lower in the mutants compared to the wild type. Our findings further elucidate the function of the OsCRTISO gene and contribute to growing understanding of the metabolic pathway of carotenoids in rice. (C) 2014 SAAB. Published by Elsevier B.V.

Imagining the Unseen: Stability-based Cuboid Arrangements for Scene Understanding	ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS			English	Article						box world; proxy arrangements; physical stability; shape analysis		Missing data due to occlusion is a key challenge in 3D acquisition, particularly in cluttered man-made scenes. Such partial information about the scenes limits our ability to analyze and understand them. In this work we abstract such environments as collections of cuboids and hallucinate geometry in the occluded regions by globally analyzing the physical stability of the resultant arrangements of the cuboids. Our algorithm extrapolates the cuboids into the unseen regions to infer both their corresponding geometric attributes (e.g., size, orientation) and how the cuboids topologically interact with each other (e.g., touch or fixed). The resultant arrangement provides an abstraction for the underlying structure of the scene that can then be used for a range of common geometry processing tasks. We evaluate our algorithm on a large number of test scenes with varying complexity, validate the results on existing benchmark datasets, and demonstrate the use of the recovered cuboid-based structures towards object retrieval, scene completion, etc.	[Shao, Tianjia; Zhou, Kun] Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Monszpart, Aron; Koo, Bongjin; Mitra, Niloy J.] UCL, London WC1E 6BT, England; [Zheng, Youyi] Yale Univ, New Haven, CT 06520 USA; [Xu, Weiwei] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China	Shao, TJ (reprint author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.

J	Northoff, G				Northoff, Georg			Do cortical midline variability and low frequency fluctuations mediate William James' "Stream of Consciousness"? "Neurophenomenal Balance Hypothesis" of "Inner Time Consciousness"	CONSCIOUSNESS AND COGNITION			English	Review						"Inner time Consciousness"; William James; Cortical midline structures; Variability; Frequency fluctuations; Functional connectivity	NEURAL BASIS; FUTURE; PERCEPTION; NETWORK; BRAINS	William James famously characterized consciousness by 'stream of consciousness' which describes the temporal continuity and flow of the contents of consciousness in our 'inner time consciousness'. More specifically he distinguished between "substantive parts", the contents of consciousness, and "transitive parts", the linkages between different contents. While much research has recently focused on the substantive parts, the neural mechanisms underlying the transitive parts and their characterization by the balance between 'sensible continuity' and 'continuous change' remain unclear. The aim of this paper is to develop so-called neuro-phenomenal hypothesis about specifically the transitive parts and their two phenomenal hallmark features, sensible continuity and continuous change in 'inner time consciousness'. Based on recent findings, I hypothesize that the cortical midline structures and their high degree of variability and strong low frequency fluctuations play an essential role in mediating the phenomenal balance between sensible continuity and continuous change.

It is found that phosphorene possesses a prominent anisotropic elasticity with the large anisotropic factor of 15.5. Along the armchair direction, the phosphorene sheet exhibits a high tensile ductility, characterized by a large elastic strain limit of 0.31. While in the zigzag direction, the critical strain of phosphorene is dictated by the phonon instability and the in-plane soft mode occurs beyond the 0.22 strain. Under uniaxial strains, the band gaps of phosphorene can be modulated continuously, whose band features are also altered accordingly. A Dirac-like band structure appears in phosphorene under adequate strains along the zigzag direction. More interestingly, these Dirac cones of phosphorene display evident anisotropy, which have high Fermi velocities up to (6 - 7) x 10(5) m/s along the armchair direction but drop to zero along the zigzag direction. With such a characteristic, the strained phosphorene sheet acts as an intriguing one-dimensional metal, which enables the system many potential applications in power-efficient and ultrafast nanodevices.

In this paper, we present a sheep brucellosis model with immigration and proportional birth, and consider both direct and indirect transmission with infected animals and the bacteria of the environment. The basic reproduction number R-0 of this model is identified and global dynamics are completely determined by R-0. If R-0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium is global asymptotically stable; whereas if R-0 > 1, there is a unique endemic equilibrium which is global asymptotically stable. By numerical simulations for the cases with R-0 < 1 and R-0 > 1 to demonstrate the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium and the unique endemic equilibrium, respectively. In addition, sensitivity analysis of the basic reproduction number in term of some parameters is given, this paper confirmed that elimination, vaccination and disinfection are the useful control strategies, and proposed to reduce immigration and self-sufficiency of the flock for controlling sheep brucellosis.

In addition, dissolved organic matter (DOM) can serve as a carrier that enhances the migration and transformation of heavy metals. Here, pig manure amended with rice straw was vermicomposted with Eisenia fetida. The DOM content, molecular weight distribution, and spectroscopic properties of the amended pig manure were measured before and after vermicomposting. The Cu and Zn concentrations in the earthworms increased from 8.24 and 17.63 to 40.75 and 362.78 mg/kg separately after vermicomposting, and the earthworms also increased the heavy metal availability in the vermicompost. Relative to the DOM properties of conventional compost, the DOM molecular weight decreased and varied widely following vermicomposting, and the C/N ratio of the DOM in the vermicompost treatments decreased from 10.37 to 8.60. The Fourier transform far-infrared (FTIR) and fluorescence spectra of the DOM indicated that the amounts of oxygen-containing structures increased while the ratio of humic acid to fulvic acid decreased following vermicomposting. Accordingly, the earthworms augmented the heavy metal mitigation risk in the pig manure. This augment potentially resulted from the decreased humic acid-to-fulvic acid (HA/FA) ratio from DOM structural changes.

A field experiment involving organic fertilizer (OF), chemical fertilizer (CF), and unfertilized control (CK) treatments was arranged to analyze the temporal changes in the bacterial and archaeal communities at bimonthly intervals based on the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene using terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) profiling. The abundances of total bacteria, total archaea, and selected functional genes (bacterial and archaeal amoA, bacterial narG, nirK, nirS, and nosZ) were determined by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). The results indicate that the structures of bacterial and archaeal communities varied significantly with time and fertilization based on changes in the relative abundance of dominant T-RFs. The abundancy of the detected genes changed with time. The total bacteria, total archaea, and archaeal amoA were less abundant in July. The bacterial amoA and denitrifying genes were less abundant in September, except the nirK gene. The OF treatment increased the abundance of the observed genes, while the CF treatment had little influence on them. The soil temperature significantly affected the bacterial and archaeal community structures. The soil moisture was significantly correlated with the abundance of denitrifying genes. Of the soil chemical properties, soil organic carbon was the most important factor and was significantly correlated with the abundance of the detected genes, except the nirK gene. Overall, this study demonstrated the effects of both temporal alteration and organic fertilizer on the structures of microbial communities and the abundance of genes involved in the nitrogen cycle.

Andrew; Zhou, Bin			Instantaneous-to-daily GPP upscaling schemes based on a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model: correcting the overestimation of GPP by directly using daily average meteorological inputs	OECOLOGIA			English	Article						Gross primary production; Temporal scaling; Integrated daily model; Segmented daily model	LEAF-AREA INDEX; FOREST; CO2	Daily canopy photosynthesis is usually temporally upscaled from instantaneous (i.e., seconds) photosynthesis rate. The nonlinear response of photosynthesis to meteorological variables makes the temporal scaling a significant challenge. In this study, two temporal upscaling schemes of daily photosynthesis, the integrated daily model (IDM) and the segmented daily model (SDM), are presented by considering the diurnal variations of meteorological variables based on a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model. The two models, as well as a simple average daily model (SADM) with daily average meteorological inputs, were validated using the tower-derived gross primary production (GPP) to assess their abilities in simulating daily photosynthesis. The results showed IDM closely followed the seasonal trend of the tower-derived GPP with an average RMSE of 1.63 g C m(-2) day(-1), and an average Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency coefficient (E) of 0.87. SDM performed similarly to IDM in GPP simulation but decreased the computation time by > 66 %. SADM overestimated daily GPP by about 15 % during the growing season compared to IDM. Both IDM and SDM greatly decreased the overestimation by SADM, and improved the simulation of daily GPP by reducing the RMSE by 34 and 30 %, respectively. The results indicated that IDM and SDM are useful temporal upscaling approaches, and both are superior to SADM in daily GPP simulation because they take into account the diurnally varying responses of photosynthesis to meteorological variables. SDM is computationally more efficient, and therefore more suitable for long-term and large-scale GPP simulations.

The aim of the present study was to determine the role of microRNA-29b (miR-29b) during Ang II-induced EMT. For this purpose, we used spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats. The levels of Ang II and its receptor in the kidneys of the SHRs are significantly higher than those in the age-matched WKY rats. As shown by RT-qPCR, the expression of miR-29b in the renal cortex was lower in the SHRs than in the WKY rats. For in vitro experiments NRK-52E renal tubular epithelial cells were treated with 10(-7) M Ang II; we found that the expression of miR-29b was decreased in the cells treated with Ang II. In addition, transfection of the NRK-52E cells with miR-29b inhibitor led to the downregulation of miR-29b in these cells, and increased the expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and collagen I (Col I). Similar results were observed with the induction of Ang II expression in the NRK-52E cells. By contrast, the upregulation of miR-29b by transfection with miR-29b mimics inhibited the overexpression of these genes induced by Ang II. These results suggest that miR-29b plays an important role in Ang II-induced EMT.

LEK was overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3), purified to homogeneity and the catalytic properties were studied. Among the substrates, ethyl 4-chloro-3-oxobutanoate was converted to ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate ((R)-CHBE), an important pharmaceutical intermediate, with an excellent enantiomeric excess (e. e.) (>99 %). The mutants W28A and S209G obtained by site-directed mutation were identified with much higher molar conversion yields and lower Km values. Further, the constructed coenzyme regeneration system with glucose as co-substrate resulted in a yield of 100 %, an enantioselectivity of >99 %, and the calculated production rate of 56.51 mmol/L/H. These results indicated the potential of LEK for the industrial production of (R)-CHBE and other valuable chiral alcohols.

Rice cultivation favored PCB dechlorination and further transformation of the degradation products. Microbial dechlorination activity not only began earlier but was also 50% greater in the rhizosphere in comparison with bulk soil. Distinct profiles of both phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) and PCB congeners arose in each niche. Signature PLFAs attributed to Gram-positive (G+) bacteria were significantly correlated with the dissipation of PCB congeners in paddy field soils, especially in the rhizosphere.

Methods: Multi-stage random sampling was used to obtain a sample from 21 cities in China. Two logistic regression models were established to identify factors influencing quit intention and smoking cessation. Results: Prevalence of smoking cessation was 10.1%; 45.5% of smokers intended to quit. Women and professionals had higher cessation rates than men and nonprofessionals. Rates of quit intention were highest among managers and clerks, and lowest among those who used gifted tobacco, smoked alone, and reported addiction to nicotine. Conclusion: Individual and city level factors are associated with quit intention and smoking cessation among urban-dwelling Chinese smokers. This information should guide smoking cessation programs and inform health policy.

Satisfactory separation of bromide and bromate within 35 s was achieved in the 1.5-cm separation channel under an electric field of approximately -260 V cm(-1) in the buffer environment of 65 mM NaAc-HAc (pH 8.0). The sensitivities were improved by 12.8 for bromide and 12.0 for bromate by preparing the standards or samples in 3 mM sodium acetate instead of the background electrolyte. The detection limits for Br- and BrO3- were 0.18 and 0.22 mu g L-1, respectively, and the precisions of the migration time and reproducibilities of peak height and area were all lower than 4 %. Under the optimized conditions, the proposed method was successfully applied for speciation analysis of bromine in bread samples. Recoveries of BrO3 and Br- in six bread samples were between 97.2 and 105.2 %. The good agreement between the determined values by the proposed MCE-ICP-MS method and the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ICP-MS method was obtained. All results prove its advantages including high sensitivity, high efficiency, and low operation cost, which are beneficial to routine analysis of bromine speciation in environmental, biological, and food fields.

To understand the information sensitivity of the effect, researchers distinguish between coarse tuning for words (the N170 amplitude difference between words and symbol strings) and fine tuning for words (the N170 amplitude difference between words and consonant strings). Earlier developmental ERP studies demonstrated that the coarse tuning for words occurred early in children (8 years old), whereas the fine tuning for words emerged much later (10 years old). Given that there are large individual differences in reading ability in young children, these tuning effects may emerge earlier than expected in some children. This study measured N170 responses to words and control stimuli in a large group of 7-year-olds that varied widely in reading ability. In both low and high reading ability groups, we observed the coarse neural tuning for words. More interestingly, we found that a stronger N170 for words than consonant strings emerged in children with high but not low reading ability. Our study demonstrates for the first time that fine neural tuning for orthographic properties of words can be observed in young children with high reading ability, suggesting that the emergent age of this effect is much earlier than previously assumed. The modulation of this effect by reading ability suggests that fine tuning is flexible and highly related to experience. Moreover, we found a correlation between this tuning effect at left occipitotemporal electrodes and children's reading ability, suggesting that the fine tuning might be a biomarker of reading skills at the very beginning of learning to read.

The brain of epilepsy patients has a dynamic bifurcation that switches between epileptic and normal states. The dysfunctional state involves large-scale brain networks. It is very important to understand the network mechanisms of seizure initiation, maintenance, and termination in epilepsy. Absence epilepsy provides a unique model for neuroimaging investigation on dynamic evolutions of brain networks over seizure repertoire. By using a dynamic functional connectivity and graph theoretical analyses to study absence seizures (AS), we aimed to obtain transition of network properties that account for seizure onset and offset. We measured resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) from children with AS. We used simultaneous EEG to define the preictal, ictal and postictal intervals of seizures. We measured dynamic connectivity maps of the thalamus network and the default mode network (DMN), as well as functional connectome topologies, during the three different seizure intervals. The analysis of dynamic changes of anti-correlation between the thalamus and the DMN is consistent with an inhibitory effect of seizures on the default mode of brain function, which gradually fades out after seizure onset. Also, we observed complex transitions of functional network topology, implicating adaptive reconfiguration of functional brain networks. In conclusion, our work revealed novel insights into modifications in large-scale functional connectome during AS, which may contribute to a better understanding the network mechanisms of state bifurcations in epileptogenesis.

GPR40 has been found to couple to Gq protein, leading to the activation of phospholipase C and subsequent increases in the intracellular Ca2+ level. However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate the internalization and desensitization of GPR40 remain to be elucidated. In the present study, a construct of GPR40 fused with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) at its C-terminus was constructed for direct imaging of the localization and internalization of GPR40 by confocal microscopy. In stably transfected HEK-293 cells, GPR40 receptors underwent rapid agonist-induced internalization and constitutive ligand-independent internalization. Our data demonstrated that the agonist-mediated internalization of GPR40 was significantly blocked by hypertonic sucrose treatment and by siRNA mediated depletion of the heavy chain of clathrin. In contrast, constitutive GPR40 internalization was not affected by hypertonic sucrose or by knockdown of clathrin expression, but it was affected by treatment with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (m beta cD) and nystatin. Furthermore, our results using an arrestin-3-EGFP redistribution assay and siRNA-mediated knock-down of arrestin-3 and GRK2 expression revealed that arrestin-3 and GRK2 play an essential role in the regulation of agonist-mediated GPR40 internalization, but are not involved in the regulation of constitutive GPR40 internalization. Additionally, our observation showed that upon activation by agonist, the internalized GPR40 receptors were rapidly recycled back to the plasma membrane via Rab4/Rab5 positive endosomes, whereas the constitutively internalized GPR40 receptors were recycled back to the cell surface through Rab5 positive endosomes. Because FFA receptors exhibit a high level of homology, our observations could be applicable to other members of this family. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Residues of OCPs ranged from 0.190 to 5.17 ng g(-1) dry weight with a distinct "band type" pattern under the control of Yangtze River inputs and ECS circulation system. Differences in transmission media and redox conditions in situ respectively resulted in the divergent distributions of alpha,beta-HCH and DDD/DDE. The compositional pattern analysis implied that OCPs in the inner shelf of ECS were derived from both "weathered" and fresh sources, whereas those in the outer shelf of ECS had undergone high metabolism. Concurrent with the land-sea migration, vertical profiles of sediment cores showed increasing trends or rebound since the 1990s, characteristic of two evident "jumps" of DDE + DDD/DDT and DDT/DDE ratios. Moreover, the primary distribution pattern founded for HCHs and the considerable mass inventories calculated (6.20 metric tones for OCPs) together suggested that the contaminated sediments in the studied area to be a potential source of OCPs to the global ocean.

Thus far, this hypothesis of DMN function has not been tested directly using neurophysiological techniques. To test for the link between frontal midline DMN activity and self-relevant processing we measured neuronal activity (single-neurons' firing rates) in human subcallosal cingulate cortex (SCC) in the course of Deep Brain Stimulation surgery. We find that firing rates in SCC did not change during the presentation of specifically self-relevant stimuli when compared to the preceding pre-stimulus resting state level. In contrast, we observed significant changes in firing rates during other names in SCC. Such rest-self overlap seems to be specific for SCC since increase in firing rates in response to self-relevant stimuli were observed in another region, the subthalamic nucleus, in a group of Parkinson patients receiving deep brain stimulation surgery. These results suggest specific relationship between resting state and self-related activity, rest-self overlap, in specifically SCC as core region of the default-mode network. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

For example, neural synchronization and temporal variance has been shown by us to be altered in patients in the vegetative state (VS). This finding nonetheless leaves open the question of whether these abnormalities are specific to VS or rather more generally related to the absence of consciousness. The aim of our study was to investigate the changes of inter- and intra-regional neural synchronization and temporal variance of resting state activity in anesthetic-induced unconsciousness state. Applying an intra-subject design, we compared resting state activity in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) between awake versus anesthetized states in the same subjects. Replicating previous studies, we observed reduced functional connectivity within the default mode network (DMN) and thalamocortical network in the anesthetized state. Importantly, intra-regional synchronization as measured by regional homogeneity (ReHo) and temporal variance as measured by standard deviation (SD) of the BOLD signal were significantly reduced in especially the cortical midline regions, while increased in the lateral cortical areas in the anesthetized state. We further found significant frequency-dependent effects of SD in the thalamus, which showed abnormally high SD in Slow-5 (0.01-0.027 Hz) in the anesthetized state. Our results show for the first time of altered temporal variance of resting state activity in anesthesia. Combined with our findings in the vegetative state, these findings suggest a close relationship between temporal variance, neural synchronization and consciousness. Hum Brain Mapp 35:5368-5378, 2014.

Proanthocyanidins in brown and white cotton fibres were found to contain mainly procyanidin (PC) and prodelphidin (PD) units with 2, 3-cis form (epigallocatechin and epicatechin). However, part of the proanthocyanidins in the white cotton fibres were modified by acylation and were constitutively different from the proanthocyanidins in brown cotton fibres. The relative amount of PD was similar to that of PC in white cotton fibres, while proanthocyanidins in brown cotton fibres consisted mainly of PD units with a relative ratio of 9:1. In brown cotton fibres, the proanthocyanidin monomeric composition was consistent with the expression profiles of proanthocyanidin synthase genes, suggesting that anthocyanidin reductase represented the major flow of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway. In addition, the structural characteristics and component differences of proanthocanidins in brown and white cotton fibres suggested that quinones, the oxidation products of proanthocyanidins, were the direct contributors to colour development in brown cotton fibre. This was demonstrated by vanillin-HCl staining and Borntrager's test. Collectively, these data demonstrated that the biosynthesis of proanthocyanidins is a crucial pigmentation process in brown cotton fibre, and that quinones may represent the main pigments contributing to formation of the the brown colour. This study revealed the molecular basis of pigmentation in brown cotton fibres, and provided important insights for genetic manipulation of pigment production in cotton fibres.

The neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA particularly lend themselves towards such studies. This is because these transmitters are ubiquitous throughout the cortex, where they are the key constituents of the inhibition/excitation balance, and because they can be easily measured in vivo through magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as with select positron emission tomography approaches. How these transmitters underly functional responses measured with techniques such as fMRI and EEG remains unclear though, and was the target of this review. Consistently shown in the literature was a negative correlation between GABA concentrations and stimulus-induced activity within the measured region. Also consistently found was a positive correlation between glutamate concentrations and inter-regional activity relationships, both during tasks and rest. These findings are outlined along with results from populations with mental disorders to give an overview of what brain imaging has suggested to date about the biochemical underpinnings of functional activity in health and disease. We conclude that the combination of functional and biochemical imaging in humans is an increasingly informative approach that does however require a number of key methodological and interpretive issues be addressed before can meet its potential.

However, diagnosis of AKI with serum creatinine (SCr) level change is neither highly sensitive nor specific. Therefore, identification of novel biomarkers for early diagnosis of AKI is desirable. Aims: To evaluate the capacity of combining urinary netrin-1 and human kidney injury molecule type 1 (KIM-1) in the early diagnosis of septic AKI. Methods: We prospectively recruited 150 septic patients from Jun 2011 to Jun 2013 at Zhejiang Provincial People's Hospital, China. SCr, urinary netrin-1, and KIM-1 levels were recorded at 0, 1, 3, 6, 24, and 48 h of ICU admission and compared between AKI and non-AKI patients. In addition, we investigated the prognostic value of netrin-1 and KIM-1 between non-survivors and survivors in septic AKI patients. Results: SCr levels started to show elevation after 24 h of ICU admission. However, netrin-1 levels increased significantly as early as 1 h, peaked at 3-6 h and remained elevated up to 48 h of ICU admission in septic AKI patients. KIM-1 increased significantly by 6 h, peaked at 24 h and remained significantly elevated until 48 h of ICU admission. Furthermore, we observed significant higher urinary KIM-1 levels at 24 h and 48 h in non-survivors compared to survivors in AKI patients. Conclusions: Our results suggest that both netrin-1 and KIM-1 are clinically useful as early biomarkers in the diagnosis of septic AKI. In addition, persistent elevation of urinary KIM-1 level may be associated with poor prognosis.

Common disease-common variants hypothesis predicts that schizophrenia is attributable in part to common genetic variants. However, recent studies have clearly demonstrated that copy number variations (CNVs) also play pivotal roles in schizophrenia susceptibility and explain a proportion of missing heritability. Though numerous CNVs have been identified, many of the regions affected by CNVs show poor overlapping among different studies, and it is not known whether the genes disrupted by CNVs contribute to the risk of schizophrenia. By using cumulative scoring, we systematically prioritized the genes affected by CNVs in schizophrenia. We identified 8 top genes that are frequently disrupted by CNVs, including NRXN1, CHRNA7, BCL9, CYFIP1, GJA8, NDE1, SNAP29, and GJA5. Integration of genes affected by CNVs with known schizophrenia susceptibility genes (from previous genetic linkage and association studies) reveals that many genes disrupted by CNVs are also associated with schizophrenia. Further protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis indicates that protein products of genes affected by CNVs frequently interact with known schizophrenia-associated proteins. Finally, systematic integration of CNVs prioritization data with genetic association and PPI data identifies key schizophrenia candidate genes. Our results provide a global overview of genes impacted by CNVs in schizophrenia and reveal a densely interconnected molecular network of de novo CNVs in schizophrenia. Though the prioritized top genes represent promising schizophrenia risk genes, further work with different prioritization methods and independent samples is needed to confirm these findings. Nevertheless, the identified key candidate genes may have important roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia, and further functional characterization of these genes may provide pivotal targets for future therapeutics and diagnostics.

Due to its behavioral and physiological effects, the neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) is a useful tool to investigate stress responsivity, even though the neurobiological underpinnings of its effects are still unknown. Here we investigate the effects of OXT on cortisol stress response and neural activity during psychosocial stress. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging in healthy subjects with and without a history of ELS, we found attenuated hormonal reactivity and significantly reduced limbic deactivation after OXT administration in subjects without a history of ELS. Subjects who experienced ELS showed both blunted stress reactivity and limbic deactivation during stress. Furthermore, in these subjects OXT had opposite effects with increased hormonal reactivity and increased limbic deactivation. Our results might implicate that reduced limbic deactivation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsivity during psychosocial stress are markers for biological resilience after ELS. Effects of OXT in subjects with a history of maltreatment could therefore be considered detrimental and suggest careful consideration of OXT administration in such individuals.

Traditional cloud storage systems fail to protect data integrity information (DII), when the interactive messages between the client and the data storage server are sniffed. To protect DII and support public verifiability, we propose a data integrity verification scheme by deploying a designated confirmer signature DCS as a building block. The DCS scheme strikes the balance between public verifiable signatures and zero-knowledge proofs which can address disputes between the cloud storage server and any user, whoever acting as a malicious player during the two-round verification. In addition, our verification scheme remains blockless and stateless, which is important in conducting a secure and efficient cryptosystem. We perform security analysis and performance evaluation on our scheme, and compared with the existing schemes, the results show that our scheme is more secure and efficient.

Visualization of atomic-scale phenomena in superconductors: Application to FeSe	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; NEMATICITY; DEFECTS; STATES	We propose a simple method of calculating inhomogeneous, atomic-scale phenomena in superconductors which makes use of the wave function information traditionally discarded in the construction of tight-binding models used in the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations. The method uses symmetry-based first-principles Wannier functions to visualize the effects of superconducting pairing on the distribution of electronic states over atoms within a crystal unit cell. Local symmetries lower than the global lattice symmetry can thus be exhibited as well, rendering theoretical comparisons with scanning tunneling spectroscopy data much more useful. As a simple example, we discuss the geometric dimer states observed near defects in superconducting FeSe.	[Choubey, Peayush; Berlijn, T.; Kreisel, A.; Hirschfeld, P.

A quantum phase transition from a doubly degenerate "localized phase" to the other doubly degenerate "delocalized phase" is uncovered. Via the multi-D1 Ansatz as the variational wave function, transition points are determined accurately, consistent with the results from DMRG and exact diagonalization. An effective spatial dimension d(eff) = 2.37(6) is then estimated, which is found to be compatible with the mean-field prediction. Furthermore, the quantum phase transition is inferred to be of first order for the baths described by a continuous spectral density function. In the single-mode case, however, the transition is softened.

We investigated the role of hypothalamic inflammation in PM2.5-mediated diabetes development. Methods: KKay mice, a genetically susceptible model of Type II DM, were assigned to either concentrated PM2.5 or filtered air (FA) for 4-8 weeks via a versatile aerosol concentrator and exposure system, or administered intra-cerebroventricular with either IKK beta inhibitor (IMD-0354) or TNF alpha antibody (infliximab) for 4-5 weeks simultaneously with PM2.5 exposure. Glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, oxygen consumption and heat production were evaluated. At euthanasia, blood, spleen, visceral adipose tissue and hypothalamus were collected to measure inflammatory cells using flow cytometry. Standard immunohistochemical methods and quantitative PCR were used to assess targets of interest. Results: PM2.5 exposure led to hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, which was accompanied by increased hypothalamic IL-6, TNF alpha, and IKK beta mRNA expression and microglial/astrocyte reactivity. Targeting the NF kappa B pathway with intra-cerebroventricular administration of an IKK beta inhibitor [IMD-0354, n = 8 for each group)], but not TNF alpha blockade with infliximab [(n = 6 for each group], improved glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, rectified energy homeostasis (O-2 consumption, CO2 production, respiratory exchange ratio and heat generation) and reduced peripheral inflammation in response to PM2.5. Conclusions: Central inhibition of IKK beta prevents PM2.5 mediated peripheral inflammation and exaggeration of type II diabetes. These results provide novel insights into how air pollution may mediate susceptibility to insulin resistance and Type II DM.

The zinc porphyrin monomers were preorganized together by coordination with N atoms of multidentate ligands. Subsequent one-step olefin metathesis furnished a bisporphyrin cage, a triporphyrin nanoring, and a hexaporphyrin nanoring. In the case of the hexaporphyrin nanoring, 24 terminal olefins from six porphyrin monomers reacted with each other to form 12 new double bonds, delivering the final product. The triporphyrin and hexaporphyrin nanorings were further employed as hosts to encapsulate C-60 and C-70.

J	Wang, YL; Ding, Y				Wang, Yanli; Ding, Yi			Tunable magnetic and electronic properties of BN nanosheets with triangular defects: a first-principles study	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						BN nanostructure; vacancy defect; magnetic state; substrate effect	HEXAGONAL BORON-NITRIDE; CHEMICAL-VAPOR-DEPOSITION; GRAPHENE ELECTRONICS; NANORIBBONS	Experimentally, vacancy defects are commonly observed in BN nanosheets, expecially nitrogen-terminated triangular defects. Based on first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the magnetic and electronic properties of BN nanosheets with these triangular vacancies (referred to as V-i (i = 1 - 4) defects with i representing the number of N atoms on each side of the triangle). It is found that the V-i defects bring diverse magnetic states into BN sheets, which are ferrimagnetic for V-1, nonmagnetic for V-2, ferrimagnetic for V-3 and antiferromagnetic for V-4 defects. When the isotropic strains are applied, the ferrimagnetic state is sustained for V-1 defect, whereas the V-2 defect undergoes a nonmagnetic to antiferromagnetic transition and the V-3, V-4 defects experience an abrupt change in the absolute magnetic moments under small strains, which are originated from the N-N bond breaking at these defects. Different from the BN nanoribbons, the antiparallel coupling is more favorable for the N atoms at the edges of triangular defects. Due to the triangular defects, the band gaps of BN sheets are reduced substantially, which could be further modulated by the strains. When the defective BN sheets serve as a substrate for graphene, the V-1, V-3 and V-4 defects in BN would induce p-type doping in the graphene sheet. Interestingly, when the V-2 defect is embedded in BN sheets, the doping behavior of graphene can be well-controlled by the strain, which is charge neutral at the strain-free state and p-type doped under strains. Our studies demonstrate that the rich magnetic and electronic properties of BN sheets with triangular defects enable the system's potential applications in nanodevices.

The compound crystallizes in a tetragonal lattice (space group I4/mmm, a = 4.0771(1) angstrom, c = 32.4330(6) angstrom, and Z = 2), in which CaF2-type Eu3F4 layers and NaCl-like BiS2 bilayers stack alternately along the crystallographic c axis. There are two crystallographically distinct Eu sites, Eu(1) and Eu(2) at the Wyckoff positions 4e and 2a, respectively. Our bond valence sum calculation, based on the refined structural data, indicates that Eu(1) is essentially divalent, while Eu(2) has an average valence of +2.64(5). This anomalous Eu valence state is further confirmed and supported, respectively, by Mossbauer and magnetization measurements. The Eu3+ components donate electrons into the conduction bands that are mainly composed of Bi 6px and 6py states. Consequently, the material itself shows metallic conduction and superconducts at 1.5 K without extrinsic chemical doping.

Previous studies indicated that Olig3 controlled the patterning of dorsal spinal cord and loss of Olig3 function led to the re-specification of dI2 and dI3 neurons into dI4 interneurons. However, the role of Olig3 in regulating the development of ventral spinal cord has remained unknown. BrdU labeling demonstrated that ventral Olig3 was expressed in the post-mitotic neurons and Olig3+ cells seen at late embryonic stages were born at the earlier stage but remained in the marginal zone throughout embryogenesis. Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiment indicated that Nkx2.2 regulated the expression of Olig3 in V3 interneurons. However, Olig3 mutation didn't apparently affect the generation and migration of ventral neurons. These findings suggest that Olig3 plays different roles in regulating the development of dorsal and ventral spinal cord.

One of the most successful recommendation techniques is the collaborative filtering, which has been extensively investigated and has already found wide applications in e-commerce. One of challenges in this algorithm is how to accurately quantify the similarities of user pairs and item pairs. In this paper, we employ the multidimensional scaling (MDS) method to measure the similarities between nodes in user-item bipartite networks. The MDS method can extract the essential similarity information from the networks by smoothing out noise, which provides a graphical display of the structure of the networks. With the similarity measured from MDS, we find that the item-based collaborative filtering algorithm can outperform the diffusion-based recommendation algorithms. Moreover, we show that this method tends to recommend unpopular items and increase the global diversification of the networks in long term.

It is still a matter of discussion what influences of inorganic components on block copolymer structures. In this work we present the critical role of conformationally restricted effect by cadmium acetate (Cd(Ac)(2)) on microscopic structure and film stability of polystyrene-block-poly(2-vinylpyridine) (S2VP) and polystyrene-block-poly(4-vinylpyridine) (S4VP). The influence of ion concentration, coordination type, as well as physical ageing on micelles and films were investigated and discussed. It was revealed that the coordination type played a critical role in both micelle and thin film morphology. As ion concentration increased, the intermolecular coordination between Cd(Ac)(2) and S4VP led to significant micelle coalescence and a decrease of film stability. However, intramolecular coordination between Cd(Ac)(2) and S2VP only affected the micelle size. The film prepared from a physically aged low Cd2+ concentration S4VP solution formed mesoporous structure. AFM and GISAXS results showed excellent lateral ordering within mesoporous films. These results suggest a facile procedure for the preparation of block copolymer mesoporous structures which can provide the base for highly functional materials such as highly efficient catalysts, photonic devices, and photovoltaic films.

CeNiAsO undergoes two successive anti-ferromagnetic transitions at T-N1 = 9.3K and T-N2 = 7.3K; SmNiAsO becomes an anti-ferromagnet below T-N similar or equal to 3.5K; NdNiAsO keeps paramagnetic down to 2K but orders anti-ferromagnetically below T-N similar or equal to 1.3K. Superconductivity was observed only in Kramers non-magnetic LaNiAsO and PrNiAsO with T-c = 2.7K and 0.93 K, respectively. The superconductivity of PrNiAsO is further studied by upper critical field and specific heat measurements, which reveal that PrNiAsO is a weakly coupled Kramers non-magnetic superconductor. Our work confirms that the nickel-based oxyarsenide superconductors are substantially different in mechanism to iron-based ones, and are likely to be described by the conventional superconductivity theory.

In addition to forming a heterodimer with other ErbB receptors in response to ligand stimulation, ErbB2 can be activated in a ligand-independent manner. We report here that Erbin, an ErbB2-interacting protein that was thought to act as an antitumor factor, is specifically expressed in mammary luminal epithelial cells and facilitates ErbB2-dependent proliferation of breast cancer cells and tumorigenesis in MMTV-neu transgenic mice. Disruption of their interaction decreases ErbB2-dependent proliferation, and deletion of the PDZ domain in Erbin hinders ErbB2-dependent tumor development in MMTV-neu mice. Mechanistically, Erbin forms a complex with ErbB2, promotes its interaction with the chaperon protein HSP90, and thus prevents its degradation. Finally, ErbB2 and Erbin expression correlates in human breast tumor tissues. Together, these observations establish Erbin as an ErbB2 regulator for breast tumor formation and progression.

Environmental water deficiency triggers an osmotic stress signalling cascade, which induces short-term cellular responses to reduce water loss and long-term responses to remodel the transcriptional network and physiological and developmental processes(1-4). Several signalling components that have been identified by extensive genetic screens for altered sensitivities to osmotic stress seem to function downstream of the perception of osmotic stress. It is known that hyperosmolality and various other stimuli trigger increases in cytosolic free calcium concentration ([Ca2+](i))(5,6). Considering that in bacteria and animals osmosensing Ca2+ channels serve as osmosensors(7,8), hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+] i increases have been widely speculated to be involved in osmosensing in plants(1,9). However, the molecular nature of corresponding Ca2+ channels remain unclear(6,10,11). Here we describe a hyperosmolalitygated calcium-permeable channel and its function in osmosensing in plants. Using calcium-imaging-based unbiased forward genetic screens we isolated Arabidopsis mutants that exhibit low hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+](i) increases. These mutants were rescreened for their cellular, physiological and developmental responses to osmotic stress, and those with clear combined phenotypes were selected for further physical mapping. One of the mutants, reduced hyperosmolality-induced [Ca2+](i) increase 1 (osca1), displays impaired osmotic Ca2+ signalling in guard cells and root cells, and attenuated water transpiration regulation and root growth in response to osmotic stress. OSCA1 is identified as a previously unknown plasma membrane protein and forms hyperosmolality-gated calcium-permeable channels, revealing that OSCA1 may be an osmosensor. OSCA1 represents a channel responsible for [Ca2+](i) increases induced by a stimulus in plants, opening up new avenues for studying Ca2+ machineries for other stimuli and providing potential molecular genetic targets for engineering drought-resistant crops.

It is relevant to develop a general method to differentiate the isomeric halogenated phenylmethylidene hydrazinecarbodithioates (M-X, X = F, Cl, Br). METHODS: Diluted CH3CN solutions containing NiCl2 and a title isomer (MX) were analyzed by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry (ESI-MSn) in a quadrupole ion trap instrument equipped with an ESI source. Theoretical calculations were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) method at the uB3LYP / 6-31+ G(2d, p) level. RESULTS: In MS3 experiments, the complex [M-X + SCH3 + Ni](+) ion, resulting from dissociation of the ESI-generated complex [2M(X) - H + Ni](+) ion, undergoes ligand-exchange reactions with residual gas molecules, such as water, acetonitrile, and nitrogen in the ion trap, and the o-isomers [Mo-X + SCH3 + Ni](+) were found to undergo the characteristic HX elimination reactions to afford several unique ions. Each set of three isomers [M-X + SCH3 + Ni](+) show significantly different reactivity, which has been corroborated by MS4 experiments and theoretical calculations. CONCLUSIONS: A rapid method based on metal complexation and tandem mass spectrometric (MSn) analysis has been developed to differentiate three sets of positional isomers of halogenated phenylmethylidene hydrazinecarbodithioates (M-X, X = F, Cl, Br).

BRCA1 modulates the autophosphorylation status of DNA-PKcs in S phase of the cell cycle	NUCLEIC ACIDS RESEARCH			English	Article							DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; STRAND BREAK REPAIR; CATALYTIC SUBUNIT; END RESECTION; HOMOLOGOUS RECOMBINATION; IONIZING-RADIATION; BINDING; PHOSPHORYLATION; KU; MECHANISMS	Non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) and homologous recombination (HR) are the two prominent pathways responsible for the repair of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). NHEJ is not restricted to a cellcycle stage, whereas HR is active primarily in the S/G2 phases suggesting there are cell cycle-specific mechanisms that play a role in the choice between NHEJ and HR. Here we show NHEJ is attenuated in S phase via modulation of the autophosphorylation status of the NHEJ factor DNA-PKcs at serine 2056 by the pro-HR factor BRCA1. BRCA1 interacts with DNA-PKcs in a cell cycle-regulated manner and this interaction is mediated by the tandem BRCT domain of BRCA1, but surprisingly in a phospho-independent manner. BRCA1 attenuates DNA-PKcs autophosphorylation via directly blocking the ability of DNA-PKcs to autophosphorylate. Subsequently, blocking autophosphorylation of DNA-PKcs at the serine 2056 phosphorylation cluster promotes HR-required DNA end processing and loading of HR factors to DSBs and is a possible mechanism by which BRCA1 promotes HR.

The molecular structures of these products were determined by X-ray crystallography. All these reactions are parallel to those of a hypercoordinate silylene with ?5-pentamethylcyclopentadienyl ligands, decamethylsilicocene, reported by Jutzi et al. and are suggested to involve similarly the formation of the corresponding Si?X doubly bonded compounds (X = O, S) at the initial steps. Mechanistic details of the multistep reaction of a model dialkylsilylene with CO2 were investigated using DFT calculations.

Dihydrotanshinone. I, tanshinone I, cryptotanshinone, and tanshinone IIA were selected as the model compounds, and the extraction parameters, including mesoporous concentration, extraction time, sample agitation and desorption solvents, were optimized. The interaction with the analytes and large surface area of the MHM facilitated the adsorption of analytes. The method showed good linearity, with correlation coefficients >0.9980 in the ragne 0.25-100 ng/mL, and low limits of detection (0.012-0.046 pg). Finally the recovery values were 91-103% for Danshen tea, 89-102% for Danshen, and 88-96% for tanshinone capsules. The results showed that the proposed method was suitable for the extraction and determination of tanshinones in complex samples.

It has previously been reported that transcription factor Nkx6.1 is expressed in neuroepithelial cells that give rise to astrocyte precursors in the ventral spinal cord. In the present study, we systematically investigated the function of Nkx6.1 in astrocyte development using both conventional and conditional Nkx6.1 mutant mice. At early postnatal stages, Nkx6.1 was expressed in a subpopulation of astrocytes in the ventral spinal cord. In the conventional Nkx6.1KO spinal cord, the initial specification of astrocyte progenitors was affected by the mutation, and subsequent migration and differentiation were disrupted in newborn mice. In addition, the development of VA2 subtype astrocytes was also inhibited in the white matter. Further studies with Nkx6.1 conditional mutants revealed significantly delayed differentiation and disorganized arrangement of fibrous astrocytes in the ventral white matter. Together, our studies indicate that Nkx6.1 plays a vital role in astrocyte specification and differentiation in the ventral spinal cord.

The results show that there are 170 and 233 variable sites in the gene sequences of mitochondrial DNA in the COI and 16S rRNA genes, respectively. A seven-base insert segment (CGACTAC) was found in COI-B1B and COI-Y4D, whereas no such fragment was found in the 16S rRNA. Results suggest that the genetic differences amongst most individuals are small, thus similar colour morphs do not cluster in the same branch, and these variations have no taxonomic significance.

Previous study revealed that the vulcan gene of Drosophila melanogaster contained four exons in its coding region. In the current study, a newly created intron (Intron L) was identified on exon 2 of vulcan in D. melanogaster by comparing expression sequence tags. The RT-PCR experiment revealed that Intron L was associated with intron retention, in which two alternative transcripts of the gene differ by the inclusion or removal of an intron. It was found that Intron L was created by intronization of exonic sequence, and its donor and acceptor splice sites were created by synonymous mutation, leading to the origin of a new vulcan protein that is 22 amino acids shorter than the previously reported vulcan protein. Moreover, to track the origin of Intron L, 36 orthologous genes of species of Drosophila were cloned or annotated, and phylogenetic analysis was carried out. It indicated that the common ancestor of D. melangaster subgroup species created Intron L about 15 million years ago.

Monitoring the dynamic variation of DOC inventories in coastal oceans provide more information on carbon flux, but is very challenging in practice. We propose a method of estimating DOC inventories in the East China Sea (ECS) by integrating the surface DOC distribution with a vertical model of the DOC profile via satellite data. Surface DOC concentration was retrieved from satellite-derived chromophoric dissolved organic matter and chlorophyll concentration. Two vertical DOC profile models (uniform model and stratified model) were established based on water-density profiles, and the usage of these two models was corresponded to water mass classification determined by a water mass index. The average bias of the satellite-derived DOC inventory, in the euphotic layer was 23.8% in spring, 24.8% in autumn and 14.7% in winter, and in the water column was 15.6% in spring, 12.3% in autumn, and 10.2% in winter. The total satellite-derived DOC inventory integrated in the water column was about 31.84, 31.96, 28.59, and 31.18 Tg in four seasons in the ECS (5.84 x 10(5) km(2)). Sensitivity analysis indicated that the remote-sensing method of estimating DOC inventory is stable and reliable. The available long-term and large-scale satellite-derived DOC inventories in marginal sea would provide us basic information on carbon cycle, and the difference between the seasonal DOC inventories would help to understand the DOC export and relative biogeochemical processes in the ECS.

However, the extent to which such top-down, memory-driven biasing of visual perception is contingent on conscious awareness remains unknown. Here we showed that conscious awareness of critical visual cues is dispensable for working memory to bias perceptual selection mechanisms. Using the procedure of continuous flash suppression, we demonstrated that "unseen" visual stimuli during interocular suppression can gain preferential access to awareness if they match the contents of visual working memory. Strikingly, the very same effect occurred even when the visual cue to be held in memory was rendered nonconscious by masking. Control experiments ruled out the alternative accounts of repetition priming and different detection criteria. We conclude that working memory biases of visual perception can operate in the absence of conscious awareness.

We present an automatic 3D scene update algorithm to indoor scenes by capturing scene variation with RGBD cameras. We assume an initial scene has been reconstructed in advance in manual or other semi-automatic way before the change, and automatically update the reconstruction according to the newly captured RGBD images of the real scene update. It starts with an automatic segmentation process without manual interaction, which benefits from accurate labeling training from the initial 3D scene. After the segmentation, objects captured by RGBD camera are extracted to form a local updated scene. We formulate an optimization problem to compare to the initial scene to locate moved objects. The moved objects are then integrated with static objects in the initial scene to generate a new 3D scene. We demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of our approach by updating the 3D scene of several real-world scenes.

Inspired by the experiment, a first-principles study on these 4-8 LD-embedded BN sheets and the doping effects of transition metal (TM) atoms was conducted. It was found that the homoelemental bonds induce defect states in the band gap of BN sheets, which markedly reduce the gap value by 38%. The line defect binds the foreign TM atoms strongly, which can form one-dimensional TM chains in the sheets. Consequently, diverse electronic and magnetic properties are induced into BN sheets: the Cr- and Ni-chain dopings bring a quasi-spin-gapless semiconducting feature, the Fe- and Co-chain dopings cause a ferromagnetic semiconducting behavior, and the Mn one even transforms the sheets into antiferromagnetic semiconductors. The studies demonstrate that these TM-chain-doped BN sheets are potential candidates for spintronics and nanodevices.

The quantum mechanical computational approach was employed to design the molecularly imprinted polymers with carbofuran as template. The interaction energies between the template molecule and different functional monomers in various solvents were calculated to assist in the selection of the functional monomer and porogen. The optimised molecularly imprinted polymer was subsequently used as a class-selective sorbent in solid-phase extraction for pre-concentration and determination of carbamates from environmental water. The parameters influencing the extraction efficiency of the molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction procedure were systematically investigated to facilitate the class-selective extraction. For the proposed method, linearity was observed over the range of 2-500 ng/mL with the correlation coefficient ranging from 0.9760 to 1.000. The limits of detection ranged from 0.2 to 1.2 ng/mL, and the limit of quantification was 4 ng/mL. These results confirm that computer-assisted design is an effective evaluation tool for molecularly imprinted polymers synthesis, and that molecularly imprinted solid-phase extraction can be applied to the simultaneous analysis of carbamates in environmental water.

Twelve participants were asked to judge the acceptability of different types of behaviors, which varied in their level of moral wrongness and physical disgust while event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded. The main results showed that the two morally wrong conditions elicited greater amplitudes of P300-400 at frontal sites than the neutral condition and the physically disgusting, but not morally wrong, condition. The physically disgusting conditions (with and without moral content) elicited significantly more positive deflections in the 500-600 ms timeframe than the neutral condition at central-posterior sites. These findings indicate that our aversion to harmful substances in the physical environment and offensive behaviors in the social environment may be neurologically dissociable in the temporal dimension. Furthermore, the detection of moral violations may be processed earlier in time than that of physical disgust. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The failure of OPC differentiation is a major cause of demyelinating diseases; thus, identifying the molecular mechanisms that affect OPC differentiation is critical for understanding the myelination process and repairing after demyelination. Although prevailing evidence shows that OPC differentiation is a highly coordinated process controlled by multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as growth factors, axon signals, and transcription factors, the intracellular signaling in OPC differentiation is still unclear. Here, we showed that glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3 beta) is an essential positive modulator of OPC differentiation. Both pharmacologic inhibition and knockdown of GSK3 beta remarkably suppressed OPC differentiation. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling assays and Ki67 staining showed that the effect of GSK3 beta on OPC differentiation was not via cell death. Conversely, activated GSK3 beta was sufficient to promote OPC differentiation. Our results also demonstrated that the transcription of myelin genes was regulated by GSK3 beta inhibition, accompanying accumulated nuclear beta-catenin, and reduced the expression of transcriptional factors that are relevant to the expression of myelin genes. Taken together, our study identified GSK3 beta as a profound positive regulator of OPC differentiation, suggesting that GSK3 beta may contribute to the inefficient regeneration of oligodendrocytes and myelin repair after demyelination.

Existing methods propose to identify the real alerts to aid the administrators. In our paper, we extend the idea of filtering irrelevant alerts based on alert volumes. And we formulate the flow estimation of abrupt changes in feature distribution caused by anomalies, by computing Kullback-Leibler distance of alert feature values under observation in comparison with a reference distribution, which is the mixture of a distribution drawing a tread from historical alerts, and a distribution derived from expertise provided by administrators. Experimental studies on the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency dataset as well as real-life data gathered from the IDS of a large network show that our method is able to distinguish and highlight genuine anomalies arising from the tremendous number of intrusion alerts, including different kinds of attacks and network failures. Application of this technique to alerts greatly helps the administrators in identifying real alerts and then reduces the alert load in the future. Copyright (C) 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

These compounds showed weak emission in the solution state, owing to active intramolecular rotation (IMR), but the synergistic effect from electronic coupling between the PFC and the silole ring compensated for the emission quenching by the IMR process to some extent, thereby affording higher emission efficiencies than those of 2,3,4,5-tetraphenylsiloles in solution. These new siloles showed enhanced emission efficiencies in the aggregated state. The electroluminescence (EL) color and efficiency of new siloles were sensitive towards the PFC. Siloles containing naphthalene moieties showed green EL emission, whilst those containing anthracene moieties showed orange EL emission. The siloles containing pyrene moieties exhibited yellow EL emission at 546nm, with a peak luminance of 49000cdcm(-2) and a high current efficiency of 9.1cdA(-1).

Two independent forms of IOR have been theorized: input-based IOR occurs when the oculomotor system is quiescent, while output-based IOR occurs when the oculomotor system is engaged. EEG studies forbidding eye movements have demonstrated that reductions of target-elicited P1 components are correlated with IOR magnitude, but when eye movements occur, P1 effects bear no relationship to behavior. We expand on this work by adapting the cueing paradigm and recording event-related potentials: IOR is caused by oculomotor responses to central arrows or peripheral onsets and measured by key presses to peripheral targets. Behavioral IOR is observed in both conditions, but P1 reductions are absent in the central arrow condition. By contrast, arrow and peripheral cues enhance Nd, especially over contralateral electrode sites.

Therefore, previous studies of superposed stress fields based on fractures have been generally performed in areas with proper observation conditions and clear abutting relationships. In contrast, in many other areas, the identification of fracture development period based on field observation is often infeasible. Compared to abutting relationships, fracture fabrics obtained from field measurement are not affected by the restriction of outcrops and consequently are more representative of the fractures. According to the analysis of fracture fabrics and fracture features, this paper has separated and extracted the superposed fracture sets and identified the fracture development period in the area without available abutting relationships. Taking the southern segment of the Longmen Mountain thrust belt as an example, fractures of two development periods are identified and timed in the tectonic superposition area between two adjacent fold belts. The analysis of stress direction in each period suggests that the structural boundaries, consisting of such pre-existing structures as faults and anticlines, could have induced directional rotation in the subsequent stress. An equivalent result was achieved using a finite element simulation of the stress field. Based on the stress analysis of the field sites and the stress field simulation, the stress variation in the tectonic superposition area is well modeled.

Then, the morphology, size, in vitro release property, long-term antibacterial performance, cytotoxicity, stability and activity of this novel AM/PMAA nanogel were investigated. The results showed that the AM/PMAA nanogel sustainably released AM with long-term antibacterial activity. Moreover, the AM/PMAA nanogel could improve the stability of AM. More importantly, this AM/PMAA nanogel showed slighter cytotoxicity than AM alone, suggesting that the AM/PMAA nanogel was a more useful dosage form than AM for infectious diseases.

The toxic effects of lead are less well known for adult brain than for children. We investigated the morphological changes and amyloid precursor protein (APP) accumulation in the adult rat hippocampus following exposure to lead. Forty rats were divided into two groups of 20. One group was exposed to 580 parts per million (ppm) lead acetate and other group to an identical concentration of sodium acetate as a control group. After exposure to lead for 3 months, the hippocampus was examined by electron microscopy and APP levels in the hippocampus were detected using immunohistochemistry. Lead levels in the blood of rats exposed to lead were significantly higher than in the controls. The morphological changes in the hippocampus included mitochondrial degeneration, apoptosis and abnormal synapses in the rats exposed to lead. APP in hippocampus was increased significantly in the group exposed to lead compared to controls. We determined that lead exposure causes accumulation of APP and morphological changes in the adult rat hippocampus.

The measurement instrument of Students' Understanding of Models in Science (SUMS), developed by Treagust, Chittleborough & Mamiala (International Journal of Science Education, 24(4):357-368, 2002), has commonly been used to measure SUMS. SUMS was developed using the Classical Test Theory (CTT). Considering the limitations of CTT, in this study we applied a Rasch model to validate SUMS further. SUMS was given to 629 students in 18 classes of grades 9 and 10 from six high schools in China. The results present both additional evidence for the validity and reliability of SUMS and specific aspects for further improvement. This approach of validation of a published instrument by Rasch measurement can be applied to other measurement instruments developed using CTT.

In plants, heme oxygenases (HOs) are classified into the subfamilies HO1 and HO2. HO1 are highly conserved plastid enzymes required for synthesizing the chromophore in phytochromes which mediate a number of light-regulated responses. However, the physiological and biochemical functions of HO2, which are distantly related to HO1, are not well understood, especially in crop plants. From a population of Co-60 gamma-irradiated rice mutants, we identified the ylc2 (young leaf chlorosis 2) mutant which displays a chlorosis phenotype in seedlings with substantially reduced chlorophyll content. Normal leaf pigmentation is gradually restored in older plants while newly emerged leaves remain yellow. Transmission electron microscopy further revealed defective chloroplast structures in the ylc2 seedlings. Map-based cloning located the OsYLC2 gene on chromosome 3 and it encodes the OsHO2 protein. The gene identification was confirmed by complementation and T-DNA mutant analyses. Subcellular localization and chloroplast fractionation experiments indicated that OsHO2 resides in the stroma. However, recombinant enzyme assay demonstrated that OsHO2 is not a functional HO enzyme. Analysis of tetrapyrrole metabolites revealed the reduced levels of most chlorophyll and phytochromobilin precursors in the ylc2 mutant. On the other hand, elevated accumulation of 5-aminolevulinic acid and Mg-protoporphyrin IX was observed. These unique metabolite changes are accompanied by consistent changes in the expression levels of the corresponding tetrapyrrole biosynthesis genes. Taken together, our work suggests that OsHO2 has a potential regulatory role for tetrapyrrole biosynthesis in rice.

The World Health Organization has set a provisional guideline limit of 1 mu g/L microcystin-LR (MCLR) in freshwater. However, MCLR concentrations in several water bodies have exceeded this level. Despite this recommended human safety standard, MCLR-induced endocrine-disrupting effects and reproductive toxicity on male frog (Rana nigromaculata) were demonstrated in this study. Results showed that sperm motility and sperm count were significantly and negatively correlated with exposure time and concentration. By contrast, abnormal sperm rate was positively correlated with both parameters. Ultrastructural observation results revealed abnormal sperm morphologies, vacuoles in spermatogenic cells, cell dispersion, incomplete cell structures, and deformed nucleoli. These results indicated that MCLR could induce toxic effects on the reproductive system of frogs, significantly decrease testosterone content, and rapidly increase estradiol content. Prolonged exposure and increased concentration enhanced the relative expression levels of P450 aromatase and steroidogenic factor 1; thus, endocrine function in frogs was disrupted.

In this study, the individual and interactive effects of influent substrate concentration (TNinf), hydraulic retention time (HRT) and upflow velocity (V-up) on the performance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) in a granule-based upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor were investigated by employing response surface methodology (RSM) with a central composite design. The purpose of this work was to identify the optimal combination of TNinf, HRT and V-up with respect to the nitrogen removal efficiency (NRE) and nitrogen removal rate (NRR). The reduced cubic models developed for the responses indicated that the optimal conditions corresponded to a TNinf content of 644-728 mg N L (1), an HRT of 0.90-1.25 h, and a V-up of 0.60-1.79 m h (1). The results of confirmation trials were similar to the predictions of the developed models. These results provide useful information for improving the nitrogen removal performance of the anammox process in a UASB reactor. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Of these studies, functional connectivity analyses are mostly used. However, a new method based on the magnitude of low frequency fluctuation (LFF) during resting-state fMRI may provide important insight into MDD. In this study, we examined the amplitude of LFF (ALFF) within the whole brain during resting-state fMRI in 30 treatment-naive MDD subjects and 30 healthy control (HC) subjects. When compared with HC, MDD subjects showed increased ALFF in the frontal cortex (including the bilateral ventral/dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, premotor cortex, ventral prefrontal cortex, left dorsal lateral frontal cortex, left superior frontal cortex), basal ganglia (including the right putamen and left caudate nucleus), left insular cortex, right anterior entorhinal cortex and left inferior parietal cortex, together with decreased ALFF in the bilateral occipital cortex, cerebellum hemisphere, and right superior temporal cortex. These findings may relate to characteristics of MDD, such as excessive self-referential processing and deficits in cognitive control of emotional processing, which may contribute to the persistent and recurrent nature of the disorder.

Meanwhile, we propose the first and concrete DFA-based FPRE system, which adapts to our new notion. In our scheme, a message is encrypted in a ciphertext associated with an arbitrary length index string, and a decryptor is legitimate if and only if a DFA associated with his/her secret key accepts the string. Furthermore, the above encryption is allowed to be transformed to another ciphertext associated with a new string by a semitrusted proxy to whom a re-encryption key is given. Nevertheless, the proxy cannot gain access to the underlying plaintext. This new primitive can increase the flexibility of users to delegate their decryption rights to others. We also prove it as fully chosen-ciphertext secure in the standard model.

In this study, three sets of simulated landfill reactors, namely, conventional MSW landfill (CL), conventional MSWI bottom ash and MSW co-disposed landfill (CCL), and leachate recirculated MSWI bottom ash and MSW co-disposed landfill (RCL), were operated to investigate the environmental impact of the co-disposal. The effect of leachate recirculation on the migration of Cu and Zn in the co-disposed landfill was also presented. The results showed that the co-disposal of MSWI bottom ash with MSW would not enhance the leaching of Cu and Zn from landfill. However, the co-disposal increased the Cu and Zn contents of the refuse in the bottom layer of the landfill from 56.7 to 65.3 mg/kg and from 210 to 236 mg/kg, respectively. The recirculation of the leachate could further increase the Cu and Zn contents of the refuse in the bottom layer of the landfill to 72.9 and 441 mg/kg, respectively. Besides these observations, the results also showed that the co-disposed landfill with leachate recirculation could facilitate the stabilization of the landfill.

The bedside detection of potential awareness in patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) currently relies only on behavioral observations and tests; however, the misdiagnosis rates in this patient group are historically relatively high. In this study, we proposed a visual hybrid brain-computer interface (BCI) combining P300 and steady-state evoked potential (SSVEP) responses to detect awareness in severely brain injured patients. Approach. Four healthy subjects, seven DOC patients who were in a vegetative state (VS, n = 4) or minimally conscious state (MCS, n = 3), and one locked-in syndrome (LIS) patient attempted a command-following experiment. In each experimental trial, two photos were presented to each patient; one was the patient's own photo, and the other photo was unfamiliar. The patients were instructed to focus on their own or the unfamiliar photos. The BCI system determined which photo the patient focused on with both P300 and SSVEP detections. Main results. Four healthy subjects, one of the 4 VS, one of the 3 MCS, and the LIS patient were able to selectively attend to their own or the unfamiliar photos (classification accuracy, 66-100%). Two additional patients (one VS and one MCS) failed to attend the unfamiliar photo (50-52%) but achieved significant accuracies for their own photo (64-68%). All other patients failed to show any significant response to commands (46-55%). Significance. Through the hybrid BCI system, command following was detected in four healthy subjects, two of 7 DOC patients, and one LIS patient. We suggest that the hybrid BCI system could be used as a supportive bedside tool to detect awareness in patients with DOC.

One cognitive process, not yet investigated, is the mental representation of "Yes/No" thoughts that precede the actual overt response to a binary "Yes/No" question. In this study, we focus on examining: (1) whether spatial patterns of the hemodynamic response carry sufficient information to allow reliable decoding of "Yes/No" thoughts; and (2) whether decoding of "Yes/No" thoughts is independent of the intention to respond honestly or dishonestly. To achieve this goal, we conducted two separate experiments. Experiment 1, collected on a 3T scanner, examined the whole brain to identify regions that carry sufficient information to permit significantly above-chance prediction of "Yes/No" thoughts at the group level. In Experiment 2, collected on a 7T scanner, we focused on the regions identified in Experiment 1 to examine the capability of achieving high decoding accuracy at the single subject level. A set of regions - namely right superior temporal gyrus, left supra-marginal gyrus, and left middle frontal gyrus - exhibited high decoding power. Decoding accuracy for these regions increased with trial averaging. When 18 trials were averaged, the median accuracies were 82.5%, 77.5%, and 79.5%, respectively. When trials were separated according to deceptive intentions (set via experimental cues), and classifiers were trained on honest trials, but tested on trials where subjects were asked to deceive, the median accuracies of these regions still reached 66%, 75%, and 78.5%. These results provide evidence that concealed "Yes/No" thoughts are encoded in the BOLD signal, retaining some level of independence from the subject's intentions to answer honestly or dishonestly. These findings also suggest the theoretical possibility for more efficient brain-computer interfaces where subjects only need to think their answers to communicate. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Both small molecules possess broad absorption ranging from 300 to 800 nm with an optical band at approximately 1.50 eV and relatively low HOMO energy levels from -5.12 to approximately -5.16 eV. Expectedly, the UV-Vis absorption onset (810 nm) of TPA-DPP-BDT is largely red-shifted (60 nm) relative to that (750 nm) of previously reported BDT(TDPP) 2, which consists of BDT and DPP units. Unlike most of the TPA based molecules, strong molecular aggregation was observed in the solid state for both small molecules. In addition, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) investigations indicated that TPA-DPP-3T and TPA-DPP-BDT exhibit good miscibility with fullerene derivatives.

Although Wnt signaling has been implicated in this developmental process, the mechanism underlying Wnt-mediated regulation of basal progenitors remains elusive. Here we show that Wnt secreted from proliferative basal cells is not required for their differentiation. However, epidermal production of Wnts is essential for the formation of the spinous layer through modulation of a BMP-FGF signaling cascade in the dermis. The spinous layer defects caused by disruption of Wnt secretion can be restored by transgenically expressed Bmp4. Non-cell autonomous BMP4 promotes activation of FGF7 and FGF10 signaling, leading to an increase in proliferative basal cell population. Our findings identify an essential BMP-FGF signaling axis in the dermis that responds to the epidermal Wnts and feedbacks to regulate basal progenitors during epidermal stratification.

Zjwcf069 was then identified as Pezicula sp. through combination of morphological and phylogenetic analysis based on ITS-rDNA. Zjwcf069 here represented the first endophytic fungus in Pezicula isolated from host F. viridissima. From the fermentation broth, four compounds were obtained through silica gel column chromatography and Sephadex LH-20 under the guide of bioassay. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis as mellein (1), ramulosin (2), butanedioic acid (3), and 4-methoxy-1(3H)-isobenzofuranone (4). Compound 4 here stood for the very first time as natural product from microbes. In vitro antifungal assay showed that compound 1 displayed growth inhibition against 9 plant pathogenic fungi, especially Botrytis cinerea and Fulvia fulva with EC50 values below 50 mu g/mL. Endophytic fungi in medicinal plants were good resources for bioactive secondary metabolites.

An anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated for 665 days. During this time, the maximum nitrogen removal rate was 52.6 kgN m(-3) d(-1). Floccule floatation occurred between days 100 and 140, which potentially resulted from the sudden increase in gas yield and the poor settling ability of the floccules. Increasing the shear rate from 0.084 to 0.135 s(-1) was effective at eliminating floccule floatation. In addition, granule floatation occurred between days 572 and 665, which likely resulted from the formation of hollows within the granules. Floatation may be effectively prevented by maintaining a shear rate of more than 0.778 s(-1). Furthermore, the mechanisms of granule floatation and the floatation processes were proposed. Overall, controlling the shear force may effectively overcome sludge floatation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Our results indicate that both the phase separation within the blend and the dewetting of the film induced by composition fluctuation take place upon the selective solvent annealing, producing complex structures containing upper droplets (of one phase) and mimic-films (of the other rich-phase). The use of acetic acid (the selective solvent for PMMA) generates PMMA mimic-film and SAN droplets, while the introduction of DMF (exhibiting better solubility for SAN) vapor results in the formation of SAN mimic-film and PMMA droplets. Essentially, the interaction at polymer/substrate interface, resultant wettability of selected component, solubility of PMMA and SAN in adopted solvent dominate not only the phase separation and the dewetting of the whole film but also the synergism of them.

When the reactor was at steady-state conditions, the nitrogen loading rate (NLR) and nitrogen removal rate (NRR) were 5.63 and 4.82 kg N 111(-3) d(-1), respectively. The reactor could withstand a 1.5-fold substrate or hydraulic shock. The modified Stover-Kincannon model was used for the kinetic analysis, and the saturation value (K-B) and maximum total substrate utilization rate (U-max) were 14.5 and 14.8 kg N m(-3) d(-1), respectively. Moreover, the c(t)-Theta curve showed the existence of dead zones in the SUASB at the hydraulic retention times (HRTs) of 3 and 12 h, and the flow pattern performance of the SUASB fell between those of a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) and a plug flow reactor (PFR).

However, which mechanism involved in the progression of atherosclerosis remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the production and function of CD4(+) inflammatory and regulatory T cells in atherosclerosis-prone mice. We found that the hyperactivity and unresponsiveness to Treg-mediated suppression of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells occurred in the progression of atherosclerosis, though Treg cells were present in very large numbers and fully functional. We further found that Gr-1(+)CD11b(+) immature myeloid cells were significantly accumulated in atherosclerotic Apo E-/- mice, and they promoted resistance of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells to Treg-mediated suppression in vitro and in vivo. we further confirmed that Gr-1(+)CD11b(+) immature myeloid cells produced high level of interleukin 6 which was at least partially responsible for inducing unresponsiveness of inflammatory CD4(+) T cells to suppression via activation of Jak/Stat signaling pathway. Taken together, these findings might provide new insights to explore potential targets for immune therapeutic intervention in atherosclerosis.

In contrast to the previous results of Se doping on S sites, superconductivity is found to be rather robust against the Pt and Ni dopants on the one-dimensional Pd chains. Most strikingly, the reduced Hc(2), i.e., the ratio of H-c2/T-c, is seen to be significantly enhanced by the heavier Pt doping but suppressed in the Ni-doped counterparts, distinct from the nearly constant value in the Se-doped samples. Our findings therefore suggest that the upper critical field of this system can be modified in a tunable fashion by chemical doping on the Pd chains with elements of varying mass numbers. The spin-orbit coupling on the Pd sites, by inference, should play an important role in the observed superconductivity and on the large upper critical field beyond the Pauli pair-breaking field.

Herein, we report a facile approach to the fabrication of advanced polymeric nanocomposites of epoxy by the incorporation of polyetheramine-functionalized graphene oxide (PEA-f-GO). Two types of PEA molecules with different molecular lengths were used to synthesize the PEA-f-GO sheets. The chemical bonds formed between the amine functional groups on the GO surface and the epoxy resin during curing provided strong sheet/matrix interfacial adhesion. The addition of PEA-f-GO was found to produce significant enhancements in the mechanical properties of epoxy, including elastic modulus, tensile strength, elongation at break and toughness. In particular, the PEA-f-GO sheets containing shorter PEA molecules produced higher improvement in strength but smaller increases in both ductility and toughness than those containing longer PEA molecules. For example, at 0.50 wt% filler loading, two nanocomposites showed increases of 63% and 51% in tensile strength and 90% and 119% in toughness as compared to the unfilled epoxy. Our results suggest that the interphases between the GO and the polymer matrix can be tuned by varying the molecular lengths of grafted modifiers, thereby providing a new route for the rational designing and development of the GO-based composite materials.

BESII Collaboration	Observation of J/psi -> p(p)over-bara(0)(980) at BESIII	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							SYSTEM; DECAYS	Using 2.25 x 10(8) J/psi events collected with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII storage rings, we observe for the first time the process J/psi -> p (p) over bara(0)(980) -> pi(0)eta with a significance of 6.5 sigma (3.2 sigma including systematic uncertainties). The product branching fraction of J/psi -> p (p) over bara(0)(980) -> p (p) over bara(0)pi(0)eta is measured to be (6.8 +/- 1.2 +/- 1.3) x 10(-5), where the first error is statistical and the second is systematic. This measurement provides information on the a(0) production near threshold coupling to p (p) over bar and improves the understanding of the dynamics of J/psi decays to four-body processes.

Maltose kinase (MaK) catalyzes phosphorylation of maltose. The molecular basis for this phosphorylation is currently not understood. Here, we describe the first crystal structure of MtbMaK refined to 2.4 angstrom resolution. The bi-modular architecture of MtbMaK reveals a remarkably unique N-lobe. An extended sheet protrudes into ligand binding pocket of an adjacent monomer and contributes residues critical for kinase activity. Structure of the complex of MtbMaK bound with maltose reveals that maltose binds in a shallow cavity of the C-lobe. Structural constraints permit phosphorylation of alpha-maltose only. Surprisingly, instead of a Gly-rich loop, MtbMaK employs 'EQS' loop to tether ATP. Notably, this loop is conserved across all MaK homologues. Structures of MtbMaK presented here unveil features that are markedly different from other kinases and support the scaffolding role proposed for this kinase.

By comparing HSP70 expression patterns among representative species of reptiles and birds, and by determining the effect of HSP70 overexpression on embryonic development and hatchling traits, we have identified the role of HSP70 in the heat tolerance of amniote embryos. Consistent with their thermal environment, and high incubation temperatures and heat tolerance, the embryos of birds have higher onset and maximum temperatures for induced HSP70 than do reptiles, and turtles have higher onset and maximum temperatures than do lizards. Interestingly, the trade-off between benefits and costs of HSP70 overexpression occurred between life-history stages: when turtle embryos developed at extreme high temperatures, HSP70 overexpression generated benefits by enhancing embryo heat tolerance and hatching success, but subsequently imposed costs by decreasing heat tolerance of surviving hatchlings. Taken together, the correlative and causal links between HSP70 and heat tolerance provide, to our knowledge, the first unequivocal evidence that HSP70 promotes thermal tolerance of embryos in oviparous amniotes.

However, how they function in auxin signaling pathway and symbiosis with rhizobial in Medicago truncatula are largely unknown. The present study aims at gaining deeper insight on distinctive expression and function features of Aux/IAA family genes in Medicago truncatula during nodule formation. Principal Findings: Using the latest updated draft of the full Medicago truncatula genome, a comprehensive identification and analysis of IAA genes were performed. The data indicated that MtIAA family genes are distributed in all the M. truncatula chromosomes except chromosome 6. Most of MtIAA genes are responsive to exogenous auxin and express in tissues-specific manner. To understand the biological functions of MtIAA genes involved in nodule formation, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to test the expression profiling of MtIAA genes during the early phase of Sinorhizobium meliloti (S. meliloti) infection. The expression patterns of most MtIAA genes were down-regulated in roots and up-regulated in shoots by S. meliloti infection. The differences in expression responses between roots and shoots caused by S. meliloti infection were alleviated by 1-NOA application. Conclusion: The genome-wide identification, evolution and expression pattern analysis of MtIAA genes were performed in this study. The data helps us to understand the roles of MtIAA-mediated auxin signaling in nodule formation during the early phase of S. meliloti infection.

During the growth season, rice plants are inevitably subjected to numerous stresses, among which heavy metal stress represented by cadmium contamination not only hindering the yield of rice but also affecting the food safety by Cd accumulating in rice grains. The mechanism of Cd accumulation in rice grains has not been well elucidated. In this study, we compare the proteomic difference between two genotypes with different Cd accumulation ability in grains. Verification of differentially expressed protein-encoding genes was analyzing by quantitative PCR (QPCR) and reanalysis of microarray expression data. Forty-seven proteins in total were successfully identified through proteomic screening. GO and KEGG enrichment analysis showed Cd accumulation triggered stress-related pathways in the cells, and strongly affecting metabolic pathways. Many proteins associated with nutrient reservoir and starch-related enzyme were identified in this study suggesting that a considerably damage on grain quality was caused. The results also implied stress response was initiated by the abnormal cells and the transmission of signals may mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). Our research will provide new insights into Cd accumulation in rice grain under Cd stress. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this study, zebrafish (Danio rerio) was exposed to nominal concentrations of PFOA (0.05, 0.1, 0.5, and 1 mg/L) for 21 d. After exposure, each fish was decapitated, and the spleen was removed to detect the expression patterns of P65 transcription factor, myeloid differentiation 88, relative interleukins (ILs), and antibody genes. PFOA can stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine at a low exposure concentration (0.05 mg/L) and can inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine at higher exposure concentrations (>= 0.1 mg/L). The results of linear correlation analysis indicate that Myd88/NF-kappa B pathway is one of the important pathways to mediate inflammatory cytokine (IL-1 beta and IL-21) in zebrafish spleen. Additionally, the relative mRNA expression level of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) at 1 mg/L PFOA group was decreased to 56% of its corresponding level in the control. IL secretion disorder is possibly closely related to PFOA-induced TLR2 damage in zebrafish spleen. Furthermore, data show that the trends of PFOA-induced IL secretion have a relationship with Ig-secreting trend. This study demonstrates that PFOA can affect IL expression level through NF-kappa B, and ILs have an important function in the mediation of Ig secretion. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, it is a matter of debate whether there is any general pattern in the foraging traits (functional traits related to foraging behavior) of clonal plants in response to diverse environments. We collected data from 97 published papers concerning the relationships between foraging traits (e.g., spacer length, specific spacer length, branch intensity and branch angle) of clonal plants and essential resources (e.g., light, nutrients and water) for plant growth and reproduction. We incorporated the phylogenetic information of 85 plant species to examine the universality of foraging hypotheses using phylogenetic meta-analysis. The trends toward forming longer spacers and fewer branches in shaded environments were detected in clonal plants, but no evidence for a relation between foraging traits and nutrient availability was detected, except that there was a positive correlation between branch intensity and nutrient availability in stoloniferous plants. The response of the foraging traits of clonal plants to water availability was also not obvious. Additionally, our results indicated that the foraging traits of stoloniferous plants were more sensitive to resource availability than those of rhizomatous plants. In consideration of plant phylogeny, these results implied that the foraging traits of clonal plants (notably stoloniferous plants) only responded to light intensity in a general pattern but did not respond to nutrient or water availability. In conclusion, our findings on the effects of the environment on the foraging traits of clonal plants avoided the confounding effects of phylogeny because we incorporated phylogeny into the meta-analysis.

MWNT doped cellulose acetate nanofiber mats (MWNT/CA-NM) was prepared by electrospinning MWNT-cellulose acetate mixed solution. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the morphologies of nanofibers and the aligned distribution of MWNT along the nanofiber axis. Both the thermal stability and the mechanical properties of nanofibers were significantly improved with increased MWNT concentration. CoPc was covalently immobilized onto the surface of nanofibers after MWNT/CA-NM was hydrolyzed with KOH, oxidized with NaIO4, and spacer-arm attached with tetraethylenepentamine (TEPA), using glutaraldehyde as a coupling agent. The resulting cellulose nanofiber-based functional nanomaterial, MWNT doped, CoPc functionalized cellulose nanofiber mats (MWNT/CoPc-spacer-NM), can efficiently decolorize reactive dye wastewater, and the introduction of MWNT obviously improved the catalytic efficiency of CoPc. Ultraviolet-visible light spectroscopy (UV) and fluorescence spectroscopy (FL) experiments identified the communication between the CoPc and the MWNT, which might be responsible for the improvement of catalytic activity.

Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can enhance the effect of anti-TB drug, promote the absorption of the foci in the lung and reduce drug toxicity. In TCM, the determination of treatment is based on ZHENG (also called TCM syndrome). To establish a diagnostic model by using proteomics technology in order to identify potential biomarkers for TCM syndromes of TB. Materials and methods: The surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometer (SELDI-TOF MS) combined with weak cation exchange (WCX) magnetic beads was used to screen serum samples from 71 cases of deficiency of lung yin syndrome (DLYS), 64 cases of fire (yang) excess yin deficiency syndrome (FEYDS) and 45 cases of deficiency of both qi and yin syndrome (DQYS). A classification model was established by Biomarker Pattern Software (BPS). Candidate protein biomarkers were purified by reverse phase-high performance liquid chromatograph (RP-HPLC), identified by MALDI-TOF MS, LC-MS/MS and validated by ProteinChip Immunoassays. Results: A total of 74 discriminating m/z peaks (P < 0.001) among three TCM syndromes of TB were detected. A diagnostic model for the TCM syndrome of TB based on the five biomarkers (3961.7, 4679.7, 5646.4, 8891.2 and 9416.7 m/z) was established which could discriminate DLYS, FEYDS and DQYS patients with an accuracy of 74.0%, 72.5%, and 96.7%, respectively. The candidate biomarker with m/z of 9416.7 was identified as a fragment of apolipoprotein C-III (apoC-III) by MALDI-TOF-MS and LC-MS/MS. Conclusion: The TCM syndrome diagnostic model of TB could successfully distinguish the three TCM syndromes of TB patients. This provided a biological basis for the determination of treatment based on different TCM syndromes of TB. ApoC-III was identified as a potential biomarker for TCM syndromes of TB and revealed the biochemical basis and pathogenesis of TCM syndromes in TB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Different cryoprotectants (dimethyl sulfoxide and trehalose) at storage temperatures of 4 degrees C and -40 degrees C were selected to construct a preservation system. After 2 months of storage, the performance of the reactors and the particle characteristics from the activity recovery test revealed the advantages and disadvantages of the different storage methods. Ultimately, the preservation method adopted was storage without cryoprotectant at 4 degrees C. With the aid of this optimized method, the nitrogen removal rate reached 4.41 kg m(-3) d(-1) during the recovery period. Among the cryoprotectants assessed, dimethyl sulfoxide was found to be an appropriate cryoprotectant, and trehalose had surprising and unexpected effects. The modified Stover-Kincannon model was suitable for describing the nitrogen removal performance of the reactors with sludge after storage, except for the two reactors in which the granules were exposed to trehalose during the storage period.

J	Xia, JY; Shi, LY; Zhao, LF; Xu, F				Xia Jingyan; Shi Liyun; Zhao Lifang; Xu Feng			Impact of vitamin D supplementation on the outcome of tuberculosis treatment: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials	CHINESE MEDICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						tuberculosis; vitamin D; randomized controlled trials; systematic review; meta-analysis	MYCOBACTERIUM-TUBERCULOSIS; DOUBLE-BLIND; POLYMORPHISMS; SEASONALITY; BIAS	Background Vitamin D supplementation is believed to be beneficial in the treatment of patients with tuberculosis (TB), however, results from clinical trials have been inconclusive. Methods We performed a systematic literature search across MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Springer, EBSCO, Pro Quest, High Wire Press, and Web of Science, published as of December 2013. We individually inspected citations and extracted data independently. We estimated pooled risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using random-effect models. We also assessed risk of bias using the Jadad scale and the quality of the evidence using GRADE. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing vitamin D with or without standard TB therapy or placebo. Results A total of five studies were analyzed in our meta analysis covering 841 newly-diagnosed TB cases. Patients receiving vitamin D supplementation had a 39% reduced risk of sputum smear or culture positive after six weeks of anti-TB treatment than those in the control group, although this is not statistically significant (pooled RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.24 to 1.56, P=0.30). Apart from an increased serum vitamin D level in the supplement group after eight weeks of treatment there was no evidence of any additional adverse effects related to vitamin D. Conclusions The meta analysis results indicate that vitamin D supplementation does not seem to have any beneficial effect in the treatment of TB. Future rigorous randomized controlled trials are needed to explore whether the supplementation of vitamin D could shorten treatment duration and to confirm whether the polymorphisms of vitamin D receptor have any potentially beneficial effect.

In the optimization process, we systematically investigated the separation conditions, including the surfactants, cosurfactants, pH, buffers and fluorescence parameters. It was found that the baseline separation of the seven flavonoids was obtained in less than 5 min with a running buffer consisting of 92.9% (v/v) 5 mM sodium borate, 0.6% (w/v) ZI surfactant, 0.5% (w/v) ethyl acetate and 6.0% (w/v) 1-butanol. High sensitivity was obtained by the application of LED-IF detection. The limits of detection for seven flavonoids were in the range of 3.30 x 10(-8) to 2.15 x 10(-6) mol L-1 without derivatization. Ultimately, the detection method was successfully applied to the analysis of flavonoids in hawthorn plant and food products with satisfactory results. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the fumed silica/hydroxyl silicone oil suspension exhibits shear-thickening under steady shear and "strain-thickening" under oscillatory shear condition. Effects of hydroxy groups on the rheological behavior of silicone oil suspension with highly dispersed hydrophilic amorphous silica were investigated by infrared, H-1-NMR, and rheological test. The results show that the hydroxy groups on this system play an important role on the formation of shear thickening behavior of the suspension solution. At the same particle diameter and mass fraction, the amount of hydroxy groups on this system has a strong effect on increasing the viscosity of the suspension, which is likely due to multiassociation hydrogen bonding between liquid molecules and silanol groups on fumed silica surfaces (Si-OH).

J	Dong, LD; Zhu, D; Zhu, CC; Xu, SS				Dong Lida; Zhu Dan; Zhu Chengcheng; Xu Shanshan			Region minimised monitor design for deadlock-prevention of (SPR)-P-4 nets	IET CONTROL THEORY AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article							FLEXIBLE MANUFACTURING SYSTEMS; LIVENESS-ENFORCING SUPERVISORS; SIMPLE SEQUENTIAL PROCESSES; PETRI-NET; MINIMAL SIPHONS; POLICY; AVOIDANCE; EXTRACTION; MODELS; FMS	Constructing P-invariants is a typical way to design deadlock-prevention monitors for systems of sequential systems with shared resources ((SPR)-P-4) nets in the existing siphon-based methods. When there are some certain structures in (SPR)-P-4 nets, the existing siphon-based methods are not suitable for monitor designing. This study advances siphon's max-controlled conditions for P-invariant construction. Accordingly, a region minimised optimisation (RMO) method for deadlock-prevention monitor design is proposed, which is realised by using standardised mixed integer programming tool. In order to lower the limitation of monitors on system behaviour, the region under supervision is minimised. The RMO method is able to design monitors for (SPR)-P-4 nets in which the existing methods are not suitable, is free of trivial construction of P-invariants, and is applicable to (SPR)-P-4 nets with unobservable transitions. Since RMO is originated from the basic idea of siphon control, it remains the advantage of high computational efficiency, and also can replace the existing siphon-based monitor design methods.

Large mountain ranges and water bodies may influence the pattern of genetic diversity of this species. We sequenced the mitochondrial DNA control region (1029 bp) using 285 individuals collected from 23 localities across the species' range and obtained 18 sequences unique to Taiwan from GenBank for phylogenetic and population analysis. Two distinct clades were identified, one including haplotypes from the two westernmost localities (Hekou and Miyi) and the other including haplotypes from all sampling sites except Miyi. A strong population structure was found (Phi st = 0.76, P < 0.0001) with high haplotype diversity (h = 1.00) and low nucleotide diversity (pi = 0.0049). The Luoxiao and Nanling Mountains act as historical geographical barriers limiting gene exchange. In the haplotype network there were two "star'' clusters. Haplotypes from populations east of the Luoxiao Mountains were represented within one cluster and haplotypes from populations west of the mountain range within the other, with haplotypes from populations south of the Nanling Mountains in between. Lineage sorting between mainland and island populations is incomplete. It remains unknown as to how much adaptive differentiation there is between population groups or within each group. We caution against long-distance transfers within any group, especially when environmental differences are apparent.

The analytes were then determined by ultraperformance liquid chromatography combined with an ultraviolet detector. The extraction parameters, such as the choice of ILs, the concentrations of ILs and MFMs, the pH of diluent, and the concentration of acetic acid in the eluent, were presented. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detection and limits of quantitation were 0.4-2.8 ng mL(-1) and 1.4-9.4 ng mL(-1), respectively. The accuracy of the proposed method was investigated by recovery in herb and granules of Radix et Rhizoma Rhei, yielding values between 89.25% and 96.48%. The use of the proposed method in the sample pretreatment of complex dietary supplements is feasible due to the high surface area and excellent adsorption capacity of MFMs after modification with IL.

Chinese community-dwelling elders' needs: promoting ageing in place	INTERNATIONAL NURSING REVIEW			English	Article						Ageing; Ageing in Place; China; Community-Based Health Promotion; Community Care; Community-Dwelling Elders; Older Adults; Older People Nursing		Background: 'Ageing in place' is widely promoted as a response to global ageing and increased demand for services, but little evidence is available about what older people think they need in terms of services and supports to remain at home. Aim: To investigate older people's needs when ageing in place in order to provide evidence to inform policies and strategies promoting the option of ageing in place. Methods: A total of 568 elderly persons in Hangzhou, China, were surveyed in 2009-2011 using a modified questionnaire validated in the USA and China. Results: Overall, 88.9% of older adults were satisfied with the community in which they live; 97.2% were satisfied with life quality. Health problems and healthcare access difficulty increased with age. House repairs and housework were the most troubling. Respondents identified high need for social and health promotion services and this varied across age groups. Limitations: Cultural adaptation and validation of the questionnaire could have been influenced by differences in socioeconomic and cultural factors. The sample excluded older adults with disabilities, bed-ridden and/or unable to communicate thus limiting the scope of relevance. Conclusion: A majority of older adult respondents ageing at home lived a relatively healthy life; however, they required more comprehensive health insurance to cover costs of long-term health problems and access to home care support. Implications for nursing and health policy: The needs of community-dwelling older Chinese people in the Xiacheng District are not being fully met and much remains be done to increase community and regional capacity before ageing in place can be promoted as a policy strategy. More generally, nursing and health policies geared to enhance the self-sufficiency of older people residing in their communities must draw upon evidence of assessed needs and client perspectives of their requirements before services can be designed and delivered.

We evaluated the predictive performance of the NFS for overall mortality in a Chinese population with NAFLD. All NAFLD patients diagnosed ultrasonographically at Xixi Hospital of Hangzhou between 1996 and 2011 were retrospectively recruited to the study. Outcome was determined by interview and causes of death were confirmed by medical records. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC(ROC)) was used to determine the predictive accuracy of the NFS, BARD (body mass index, aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, diabetes) score, FIB-4 index and the AST/platelet ratio index (APRI) for mortality. Data from a total of 180 eligible patients (median age 39years; 96 men) were analysed, with 12 deaths over a median follow-up period of 6.6years (range 0.5-14.8years). Using Cox model analysis, the NFS as a continuous variable was identified as the only predictor for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio 2.743, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.670-4.504). The NFS yielded the highest AUC(ROC) of 0.828 (95% CI 0.728-0.928, P<0.05), followed by the FIB-4 index, APRI and BARD score (AUC(ROC) 0.806 (P<0.05), 0.732 (P<0.05) and 0.632, respectively). The data indicated that the NFS is a useful predictor of 6.6-year all-cause mortality for Chinese patients with NAFLD.

Three types of plume shapes were identified: (1) the commonly known northeastward transportation, (2) a case in which most of the plume water crossed the Cheju Strait into the Tsushima-Korea Straits with only a small fraction staying on the shelf of the ECS, and (3) a rare case in which the plume front moved southeastward. Satellite time-series data suggested that, during the peak river discharge time in July with favorable southwest monsoon, the plume area was highly correlated with the river discharge of the same month. Interestingly, the plume area in August was also dominated by the discharge in July. In August, as the direct effect of freshwater discharge weakening, the plume area also became positively correlated with wind speed in the 45 degrees and 60 degrees direction, suggesting that the plume extension was more influenced by the southwesterly wind during periods of smaller discharge. Furthermore, a few special cases with unique plume extensions were found under extreme weather conditions. Finally, we found no significant long-term trend of plume area change over 1998-2010 in summertime and concluded that the interannual variation was probably regulated by natural variation rather than anthropogenic effects, such as construction of the Three Gorges Dam. This study will have implications for biogeochemical and modeling studies in large river plume areas.

It has a hexagonal CaAl2Si2-type structure with the (Zn,Mn)(2)As-2 layer forming a honeycomb-like network. Magnetization measurements show that the sample undergoes a ferromagnetic transition with a Curie temperature of 12 K and magnetic moment reaches about 1.5 mu(B)/Mn under mu H-0 = 5T and T = 2K. Surprisingly, a colossal negative magnetoresistance, defined as [rho(H) - rho(0)]/rho(0), up to -38% under a low field of mu H-0 = 0.1T and to -99.8% under mu H-0 = 5T, was observed at T = 2K. The colossal magnetoresistance can be explained based on the Anderson localization theory.

An unsymmetrical molecule with D-A structure, DPP-SiPTA, was also synthesized for comparison. Both molecules were synthesized using an environmentally friendly Suzuki coupling protocol, which was modified to avoid ring-opening of the silole under basic conditions. The D-A design has an obvious effect on the electronic structure of these compounds. The D-A-D-structured DPP2(SiPTA) has a much lower band gap and HOMO than D-A-structured DPP-SiPTA. Furthermore, the molecular symmetry significantly influenced crystallinity. Organic solar cells (OSCs) based on DPP2(SiPTA)/PC71BM (1:5, w/w; PC71BM=[ 6,6]-phenyl C-71-butyric acid methyl ester) have a power conversion efficiency of 2.36% with an open-circuit voltage of up to 0.84 V, which, as expected, is much higher than that of the recently reported OSCs based on DPP2(NPTA) (0.71 V), in which pyrrole-modified pentathiophene (NPTA) is the donor unit.

In this work, alginate-whey protein was used as wall materials for encapsulating Lactobacillus delbrueckii subsp. bulgaricus (L. bulgaricus). The characteristics of encapsulated and free L. bulgaricus showed that the free L. bulgaricus lost viability after 1 min exposure to simulated gastric fluid (SGF) at pH 2.0 and 2.5. However, the viability of encapsulated L. bulgaricus did not decrease in SGF at pH 2.5 for 2 h incubation. The viable numbers of encapsulated L. bulgaricus decreased less than 1.0 log unit for 2 h incubation in SGF at pH 2.0. For bile stability, only 1.2 log units and 2.0 log units viability of the encapsulated L. bulgaricus was lost in 1 and 2% bile for 1 h exposure, respectively, compared with no survival of free L. bulgaricus under the same conditions. Encapsulated L. bulgaricus was completely released from the microspheres in simulated intestinal fluid (SIF, pH 6.8) in 3 h. The viability of the encapsulated L. bulgaricus retained more 8.0 log CFU/g after stored at 4 degrees C for four weeks. However, for free L. bulgaricus, only around 3.0 log CFU/mL was found at the same storage conditions. Results showed that the encapsulation could improve the stability of L. bulgaricus.

J	Northoff, G; Sibille, E				Northoff, G.; Sibille, E.			Why are cortical GABA neurons relevant to internal focus in depression? A cross-level model linking cellular, biochemical and neural network findings	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article							ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DEFAULT-MODE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; INHIBITORY CONNECTIVITY; RECEPTOR ARCHITECTURE	Major depression is a complex and severe psychiatric disorder whose symptomatology encompasses a critical shift in awareness, especially in the balance from external to internal mental focus. This is reflected by unspecific somatic symptoms and the predominance of the own cognitions manifested in increased self-focus and rumination. We posit here that sufficient empirical data has accumulated to build a coherent biologic model that links these psychologic concepts and symptom dimensions to observed biochemical, cellular, regional and neural network deficits. Specifically, deficits in inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid regulating excitatory cell input/output and local cell circuit processing of information in key brain regions may underlie the shift that is observed in depressed subjects in resting-state activities between the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This regional dysbalance translates at the network level in a dysbalance between default-mode and executive networks, which psychopathologically surfaces as a shift in focus from external to internal mental content and associated symptoms. We focus here on primary evidence at each of those levels and on putative mechanistic links between those levels. Apart from its implications for neuropsychiatric disorders, our model provides for the first time a set of hypotheses for cross-level mechanisms of how internal and external mental contents may be constituted and balanced in healthy subjects, and thus also contributes to the neuroscientific debate on the neural correlates of consciousness.

Time-Shift Homotopic Connectivity in Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy	AMERICAN JOURNAL OF NEURORADIOLOGY			English	Article							ALTERED FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INTERHEMISPHERIC COORDINATION; INTERICTAL SPECT; NETWORKS; SCLEROSIS; SEIZURES; FMRI; MRI; MORPHOMETRY; PROPOSAL	BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Voxel-mirrored intrinsic functional connectivity allows the depiction of interhemispheric homotopic connections in the human brain, whereas time-shift intrinsic functional connectivity allows the detection of the extent of brain injury by measuring hemodynamic properties. We combined time-shift voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity analyses to investigate the alterations in homotopic connectivity in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and assessed the value of applying this approach to epilepsy lateralization and the prediction of surgical outcomes in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Resting-state functional MR imaging data were acquired from patients with unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (n = 62) (31 left-and 31 right-side) and healthy controls (n = 33). Dynamic interhemispheric homotopic architecture seeding from each hemisphere was individually calculated by 0, 1, 2, and 3 repetition time time-shift voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity. Voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity maps were compared between the patient and control groups by using 1-way ANOVA for each time-shift condition, separately. Group comparisons were further performed on the laterality of voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity in each time-shift condition. Finally, we correlated the interhemispheric homotopic connection to the surgical outcomes in a portion of the patients (n = 20). RESULTS: The patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy showed decreased homotopic connectivity in the mesial temporal structures, temporal pole, and striatum. Alterations of the bihemispheric homotopic connectivity were lateralized along with delays in the time-shift in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy. The patients with unsuccessful surgical outcomes presented larger interhemispheric voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity differences. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed whole patterns of dynamic alterations of interhemispheric homotopic connectivity in mesial temporal lobe epilepsy, extending the knowledge of abnormalities in interhemispheric connectivity in this condition. Time-shift voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity has the potential for lateralization of unilateral mesial temporal lobe epilepsy and may have the capability of predicting surgical outcomes in this condition.

For feature extraction, an explicit guided filter is proposed to extract the eight block-based directional features from the high-quality finger vein contours obtained from noisy, non-uniform, low-contrast finger vein images without introducing any segmentation process. An FC-ELMs consist of eight single ELMs, each trained with a block feature with a pre-defined direction to enhance the robustness against variation of the finger vein images, and an output layer to combine the outputs of the eight ELMs. For the structured training of the vein patterns, the FC-ELMs are designed to first train small differences between patterns with the same angle and then to aggregate the differences at the output layer. Each ELM can easily learn lower-complexity patterns with a smaller network and the matching accuracy can also be improved, due to the less complex boundaries required for each ELM. We also designed the ensemble FC-ELMs to provide the matching system with stability. For the dataset considered, the experimental results show that the proposed system is able to generate clearer vein contours and has good matching performance with an accuracy of 99.53 % and speed of 0.87 ms per image.

Methods: A standard resolution test card and two human eyes (one eye wearing a contact lens) were imaged with an iPhone 4S adapted for slitlamp biomicroscopy in Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China. An iPhone 5 was used as a receptor on the other side of the world (Miami, FL). The real-time images and still images were transferred through Skype from Hangzhou to Miami during slitlamp eye examination. The real-time resolutions captured and displayed on the both phones at different places were measured. There was vocal communication concurrent between two parties during image transference and the examination by the slitlamp biomicroscopy performed in Hangzhou. Results: The real-time and still images were transferred between two cities while two operators talked with each other smoothly and without difficulty. The viewer in Miami was able to instruct the operator in Hangzhou to thoroughly examine the eye using the slitlamp microscopy with different magnification settings and illumination settings. The resolution of the still images recorded in the iPhone in Hangzhou was higher than that of the real-time images on the screen. The main features of the eye were recognizable in real-time. Conclusions: The study demonstrated that global teleophthalmology is feasible using two smartphones. The system is simple, portable, and affordable, and the image quality in still and real-time images is acceptable for real-time teleophthalmology.

This assessment requires the ongoing valuation of environmental stimuli. Despite much work on the processing of aversive- and appetitive-related brain signals, it is not clear to what degree these two processes interact across the brain. To help clarify this issue, this report used a cross-species comparative approach in humans (i.e. meta-analysis of imaging data) and other mammals (i.e. targeted review of functional neuroanatomy in rodents and non-human primates). Human meta-analysis results suggest network components that appear selective for appetitive (e.g. ventromedial prefrontal cortex, ventral tegmental area) or aversive (e.g. cingulate/supplementary motor cortex, periaqueductal grey) processing, or that reflect overlapping (e.g. anterior insula, amygdala) or asymmetrical, i.e. apparently lateralized, activity (e.g. orbitofrontal cortex, ventral striatum). However, a closer look at the known value-related mechanisms from the animal literature suggests that all of these macroanatomical regions are involved in the processing of both appetitive and aversive stimuli.

Epidemiological studies showed that patients suffering from anxiety disorders have higher serum cholesterol levels. In this study, we investigated the influence of high cholesterol diet on anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus maze in animal model and explored the relationship between cholesterol and anxiety-like behavior from the aspect of central neurochemical changes. Methods: Young (3 weeks old) and adult (20 weeks old) rats were given a high cholesterol diet for 8 weeks. The anxiety-like behavior in elevated plus maze test and changes of central neurochemical implicated in anxiety were measured. Results: In young rats, high cholesterol diet induced anxiolytic-like behavior, decreased serum corticosterone (CORT), increased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), increased hippocampal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and decreased glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In adult rats, high cholesterol diet induced anxiety-like behavior and increase of serum CORT and decrease of hippocampal BDNF comparing with their respective control group that fed the regular diet. Discussion: High cholesterol diet induced age-dependent effects on anxiety-like behavior and central neurochemical changes. High cholesterol diet might affect the central nervous system (CNS) function differently, and resulting in different behavior performance of anxiety in different age period.

Here, we compared the size and composition of eggs laid by female Chinese skinks (Plestiodon chinensis) from six geographically distinct populations in southeastern China to evaluate geographic variation in hatchling size. We also incubated eggs from these six populations at three constant temperatures (24, 28 and 32 degrees C) to evaluate the combined effects of incubation temperature and population source on hatchling size. Egg mass and composition varied among populations, and interpopulation differences in yolk dry mass and energy content were still evident after accounting for egg mass. Population mean egg mass and thus hatchling mass were greater in the colder localities. Females from three northern populations increased offspring size by laying larger eggs relative to their own size. Females from an inland population in Rongjiang could increase offspring size by investing relatively more dry materials and thus more energy into individual eggs without enlarging the size of their eggs. The degree of embryonic development at oviposition was almost the same across the six populations, so was the rate of embryonic development and thus incubation length at any given temperature. Both incubation temperature and population source affected hatchling traits examined, but the relative importance of these two factors varied between traits. Our data show that in P. chinensis hatchling traits reflecting overall body size (body mass, snout-vent length and tail length) are more profoundly affected by population source.

In order to better analyze different user's service requirements and provide customizable services, the new model divided workflow scheduling into two stages: the macro multi-workflow scheduling as the unit of cloud user and the micro single workflow scheduling. It introduced trust mechanism into multi-workflow scheduling level. And in single workflow scheduling level, it classified workflows into time-sensitive, cost-sensitive and balance three types according to different workflow's QoS demand parameters using fuzzy clustering method. Based on it, it customized different service strategies for different type. The simulation experiments show that the new schema has some advantages in shortening workflow's final completion time, achieving relatively high execution success rate and user satisfaction compared to other kindred solutions.

T98G human glioblastoma cells were treated with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), NVP-BEP800, NVP-BEP800 in combination with X-ray irradiation (10 Gy, 20 min), or X-ray irradiation only, and cultured for 40 h. Cell viability was meaured upon completion of the treatments. In addition, apoptosis was measured and immunoblot analysis was performed to analyze the expression levels of cellular protein inhibitory kappa B kinase beta (IKK beta). The combined treatment with NVP-BEP800 and X-ray irradiation resulted in the synergistic destruction of malignant cells. Furthermore, NVP-BEP800 significantly induced apoptosis in the human glioblastoma cells. The immunoblot analysis data indicated that NVP-BEP800 markedly reduced the expression level of IKK beta. The results also revealed that X-ray irradiation significantly attenuated the increase in the level of Hsp70 in cells treated with NVP-BEP800. Since elevated levels of Hsp70 are associated with drug resistance induced by Hsp90 inhibitors, the effects of X-ray irradiation on Hsp70 levels may be associated with the enhanced effect on cells of the presence of irradiation. The results of the current study suggest that irradiation enhances the inhibitory effect of NVP-BEP800 on the proliferation of malignant glioblastoma cells by downregulating the expression level of cellular signaling protein IKK beta and attenuating the upregulation of Hsp70 that is induced by NVP-BEP800.

However, the QC structure of rice has not yet been described in detail. In this research, using histological and marker gene expression analysis, we concluded that the rice QC is very small, and is similar to that of Arabidopsis. Next we investigated the stability of the rice QC during nutrient deficiencies or external hormone treatments, and found that nutrient deficiencies, auxin treatment and cytokinin treatment did not change the cell patterns of the QC. However, ethylene induced irregular transverse cell divisions in the QC and changed formative cell divisions of the ground tissue stem cells (GTSCs) in rice.

Vegetative regeneration capacity from shoot nodes can also be affected by the position of the nodes, but this appears little studied. We conducted a greenhouse experiment with Alternanthera philoxeroides, a highly invasive species in China, and its native congener A. sessilis to test the difference in vegetative regeneration capacity of stolon nodes at five different positions (i.e. 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th node starting from the apex of the stolon). At the end of the experiment, we counted and harvested all regenerated plants and determined their biomass and allocation. Both species could successfully regenerate from stolon fragments and node position significantly affected regeneration rate and subsequent growth. However, the vegetative regeneration capacity of A. philoxeroides was not higher than that of A. sessilis. These results suggest that vegetative regeneration from stolon fragments may not be a trait that can explain the invasiveness of A. philoxeroides.

It is commonly used in the production of Chinese snake oil, which is known for treating ailments such as fever, joint pain, and headache. It is listed as a vulnerable species according to the China red data book of endangered animals. Specific molecular markers such as mitochondrial DNA and microsatellite loci are helpful for us to get a better understanding of population structure and evolutionary history of the snake and take effective conservation action for this species. Here, we characterize eight polymorphic microsatellite loci isolated from E. chinensis genomic libraries. Forty-seven individuals were collected from Ji'an population in Jiangxi, China. These markers revealed a high degree of genetic diversity (3-10 alleles per locus) and heterozygosity (H (O) ranged from 0.532 to 0.957, and H (E) ranged from 0.565 to 0.806). No locus exhibited significant deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was no evidence of linkage disequilibrium among pairs of loci. The results of this paper will be useful for future study of population structure and genetic diversity of E. chinensis.

We examine the relationship of neural selectivity between faces and words by using a novel application of cross-category adaptation to the N170. We report a strong asymmetry between N170 adaptation induced by faces and by words. This is the first electrophysiological result showing that neural selectivity to faces encompasses neural selectivity to words and suggests that the N170 response to faces constitutes a neural marker for versatile representations of familiar visual patterns.

However, we show that Wen's scheme is still vulnerable to off-line password guessing attacks, does not provide user's anonymity and perfect forward secrecy. Further, we propose an improved scheme to fix these weaknesses, and use the applied pi calculus based formal verification tool ProVerif to prove the security and authentication.

Some neuroimaging studies have reported that PNES exhibits aberrant functional connectivity in specific brain networks. Thus, advanced neuroimaging technologies may aid clinical diagnosis and treatment of PNES. Methods: We investigated changes in brain functional connectivity in 18 patients with PNES and 20 healthy controls. Functional connectivity density mapping (FCDM), a voxelwise data-driven technique, was employed to compute local and global FCD maps. Then, short-range and long-range FCD values were calculated and group analyses performed between patents with PNES and healthy controls. A correlation analysis with clinical variables was also performed. Results: We found that patients with PNES showed abnormal FCD regions mainly in the frontal cortex, sensorimotor cortex, cingulate gyrus, insula and occipital cortex. Seed-voxel correlation analyses also showed disrupted functional connectivity between these regions. In addition, the occipital cortex FCD correlated with duration of disease. Conclusion: The present results support the hypothesis that patients with PNES are associated with altered attention, sensorimotor and emotion systems. Furthermore, correlations between altered regions in the occipital cortex and duration of disease may reflect an adaptation in these patients for long-term hypervigilance and increased response to external stimuli. This study adds new knowledge to our understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PNES. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Compared to pristine graphene, the mildly O-2 plasma treated graphene can significantly enhance the Raman peaks intensities of adsorbed Rhodamine B molecules. This effect is attributed to the strong local electric field on the adsorbed molecules induced by the oxygenated species on graphene after O-2 plasma treatments. The downshift of the Fermi level of graphene has also been demonstrated to be responsible for this chemical enhancement. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Such silane functionalization containing epoxy ended-groups is found to effectively improve the compatibility between the silane-f-GO and the epoxy matrix. Increased storage modulus, glass transition temperature, thermal stability, tensile and flexural properties and fracture toughness of epoxy composites filled with the silane-f-GO sheets are observed compared with those of the neat epoxy and GO/epoxy composites. These findings confirm the improved dispersion and interfacial interaction in the composites arising from covalent bonds between the silane-f-GO and the epoxy matrix. Moreover, several possible fracture mechanisms, i.e. crack pinning/deflection, crack bridging, and matrix plastic deformation initiated by the debonding/delamination of GO sheets, were identified and evaluated.

Experimental evidence that the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model best describes the evolution of leaf litter decomposability	ECOLOGY AND EVOLUTION			English	Article						Brownian motion model (BM); early burst model (EB); ecosystem function; effect trait; evolution; leaf litter decomposability; phylogenetic half-life	DECOMPOSITION RATES; FUNCTIONAL TRAITS; STABILIZING SELECTION; PHYLOGENETIC SIGNAL; ECOSYSTEM DYNAMICS; WIDE-RANGE; PLANT; ECOLOGY; CHEMISTRY; RADIATION	Leaf litter decomposability is an important effect trait for ecosystem functioning. However, it is unknown how this effect trait evolved through plant history as a leaf 'afterlife' integrator of the evolution of multiple underlying traits upon which adaptive selection must have acted. Did decomposability evolve in a Brownian fashion without any constraints? Was evolution rapid at first and then slowed? Or was there an underlying mean-reverting process that makes the evolution of extreme trait values unlikely? Here, we test the hypothesis that the evolution of decomposability has undergone certain mean-reverting forces due to strong constraints and trade-offs in the leaf traits that have afterlife effects on litter quality to decomposers. In order to test this, we examined the leaf litter decomposability and seven key leaf traits of 48 tree species in the temperate area of China and fitted them to three evolutionary models: Brownian motion model (BM), Early burst model (EB), and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model (OU). The OU model, which does not allow unlimited trait divergence through time, was the best fit model for leaf litter decomposability and all seven leaf traits. These results support the hypothesis that neither decomposability nor the underlying traits has been able to diverge toward progressively extreme values through evolutionary time. These results have reinforced our understanding of the relationships between leaf litter decomposability and leaf traits in an evolutionary perspective and may be a helpful step toward reconstructing deep-time carbon cycling based on taxonomic composition with more confidence.

The main objective of this study was to design a simple model for assessing N fate in swine manure amended paddy rice systems. A field experiment was conducted for three cropping seasons to determine the effectiveness of different swine manure amended levels (15%, 30%, and 45% of total N applied) on N transformations and seasonal N fate. Based on field observation data, simulation results clearly showed peaks of various N transformation rates appeared within 2 similar to 3 days after each fertilization. There was an apparent contribution of manure N on N uptake and loss when amount of manure applied was at optimum. However, at supra optimal rate, addition of manure N showed no effect on N uptake of crop and the corresponding N transformations. Across three levels, seasonal ammonia volatilization accounted for 35.6% similar to 38.0% of total N applied, N uptake was 36.7% similar to 41.1%, while N losses via vertical leaching, lateral seepage were 3.9% similar to 4.5% and 4.4% similar to 4.8%, respectively. These results were well predicted by our specific designed model, indicating the model performed effectively at assessing individual transformation process and its associated N fate and help develop efficient management strategies for swine manure amended paddy rice systems.

However, little is known regarding the ERK1/2 downstream effectors that are involved in regulating rapid, transient expression of LH-target gene in ovulatory follicles. By comparing the gene expression profiles of LH-stimulated wild type with ERK1/2-deleted ovarian granulosa cells (GCs), we identified Cited4 as a previously unknown LH target gene during ovulation. LH induced Cited4 expression in pre-ovulatory follicles in an ERK1/2-dependent manner. CITED4 formed an endogenous protein complex and docked on the promoters of LH and ERK1/2 target genes. Both CITED4 expression and CBP acetyltransferase activity leading to histone acetylation were indispensable for LH-induced ovulation-related events. LH induced dynamic histone acetylation changes in pre-ovulatory GCs, including the acetylation of histone H2B (Lys5) and H3 (Lys9). This was essential for the rapid responses and dramatic increases of LH target gene expressions by the ordered activation of ERK1/2 and CITED4-CBP. In addition, histonedeacetylases(HDACs) antagonizedCITED4-CBPto turn off expressionof these genes afterexposure to LH. Thus, we determinedthat CITED4 was a novel LH and ERK1/2 target for triggering ovulation. These results support the proposition that LH induces rapid, significant gene expression in pre-ovulatory follicles by modulating histone acetylation status.

In the present study, we posit that people's moral identity serves as a buffering factor between organizational injustice and CWB among Chinese public servants. Consistent with the hypotheses, survey results showed that organizational justice and moral identity interacted to influence Chinese public servants' CWB. Specifically, when the moral identity of Chinese public servants was low, the negative correlation between organizational justice and CWB was more pronounced. Theoretical implications to the moral identity and organizational injustice literature are discussed, as well as the practical implications and suggestions for future research.

A total of 16 nanomaterials, including nano-sized metal oxides, decorated nanoparticles, and carbonates have been carefully selected as sensing elements of 4 x 4 sensor array. Dynamic and static analysis methods were utilized to characterize the performance of the portable gas detection device to 6 kinds of drug precursor gas. Each compound gave its unique CTL pattern after interaction with the sensor array, which can be employed for the detection and identification of drug precursor gas. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to analyze the CTL patterns. The PCA plots showed that the groups of 6 types of drug precursor gas were well classified. In addition, the patterns obtained at different working temperature and the quantitative determination of the portable device was investigated. The results showed that the linear ranges and detection limits of the portable device for the analytes were excellent. Illegal drug detection is of great importance for public security, our study demonstrated the portable gas detection device shows promising perspective for the recognition and discrimination of drug precursor gas.

The excess molar volume (V-m(E)), partial excess volume at infinite dilution (V) over bar (E,infinity)(i) , isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha), excess squared refraction indices [(n(2))(E)], Lorentz-Lorenz molar refraction (R-m) and the deviation in molar refraction (Delta R-m) have been calculated using this data. The results have been incorporated into the Redlich-Kister equation and used to estimate the binary interaction parameter and standard deviation. In addition, the excess molar volume (V-m(E)) was calculated and correlated using the Legendre polynomials. The value of partial excess volume at infinite dilution (V)over bar (E,infinity)(i) for these binary systems at different temperatures was calculated from either the adjustable parameters of Redlich-Kister smoothing equation or the Legendre polynomials. The isobaric coefficient of thermal expansion (alpha) of the binary systems was estimated using the temperature dependence of the densities. The results indicate that the excess molar volumes, excess squared refraction indices and the deviations in molar refractions at each temperature were negative. These phenomena are a result of a number of factors including: the partial interstitial accommodation effect, disruption in the orientational order of the pure components and steric structure.

Here, we report that, in a layered europium bismuth sulfofluoride, EuBiS2F, a CDW-like transition occurs at 280 K, below which SC emerges at 0.3 K, without any extrinsic doping. The Eu ions were found to exhibit an anomalously temperature-independent mixed valence of about +2.2, associated with the formation of a possible dynamic CDW. The mixed valence of Eu gives rise to self electron doping into the conduction bands mainly consisting of the in-plane Bi6p states, which in turn brings about the CDW and SC. In particular, the electronic specific-heat coefficient is enhanced by similar to 50 times, owing to the significant hybridizations between Eu4f and Bi6p electrons, as verified by band-structure calculations. Thus EuBiS2F manifests itself as an unprecedented material that simultaneously accommodates SC, CDW, and f -electron valence instability.

Our results revealed that 9 generally adopted the fully extended state but changed to the contracted state when triggered by K2CO3, and recovered the original fully extended conformation after subsequent addition of 18-crown-6. Such a coordination-controlled reversible assembly reveals supramolecular springs in response to chemical stimuli, which is of great interest in bionics and materials science.

It is a well-documented fact that IOR is not restricted to previously attended locations, but rather has a spatial gradient. Based on a myriad of manual/saccadic dissociations, many researchers now believe that there are at least two forms of IOR completely dissociable on the basis of response type. The present study evaluated whether these two forms of IOR are encoded in similar representations of space. Across a range of conditions, there was little indication that the two forms could be differentiated on the basis of their spatial distributions. Furthermore, the present study also found that the gradient of IOR was steepest for cues appearing nearest fixation. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of e(+)e(-) -> p(p)over-bar pi(0) in the vicinity of the psi(3770)	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							BRANCHING FRACTION; E&E-ANNIHILATION; CROSS-SECTIONS; DECAYS; PSI''	The process e(+)e(-) -> p (p) over bar pi(0) has been studied by analyzing data collected at root s = 3.773 GeV, root s = 3.650 GeV, and during a psi(3770) line shape scan with the BESIII detector at the BEPCII collider. The Born cross section of p (p) over bar pi(0) in the vicinity of the psi(3770) is measured, and the Born cross section of psi(3770) -> p (p) over bar pi(0) is extracted considering interference between resonant and continuum production amplitudes. Two solutions with the same probability and a significance of 1.5 sigma are found. The solutions for the Born cross section of psi(3770) -> p (p) over bar pi(0) are 33.8 +/- 1.8 +/- 2.1 pb and 0.06(-0.04-0.01)(+0.10+0.01) pb (< 0.22 pb at a 90% confidence level). Using the estimated cross section and a constant decay amplitude approximation, the cross section sigma(p<(p)over bar> -> psi(3770)pi(0)) is calculated for the kinematic situation of the planned (p) over bar ANDA experiment. The maximum cross section corresponding to the two solutions is expected to be less than 0.79 nb at 90% confidence level and 122 +/- 10 nb at a center-of-mass energy of 5.26 GeV.	[Ablikim, M.; Ai, X.

For example, differences in MRI measures (e.g., network strength, white matter integrity) between patient and control groups may be due to the differences in their head motion. To determine whether head motion is an important variable in itself, or just simply a confounding variable, we explored individual differences in psychological traits that may predispose some people to move more than others during an MRI scan. In the first two studies, we demonstrated in both children (N = 245) and adults (N = 581) that head motion, estimated from resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, was reliably correlated with impulsivity scores. Further, the difference in head motion between children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children was largely due to differences in impulsivity. Finally, in the third study, we confirmed the observation that the regression approach, which aims to deal with motion issues by regressing out motion in the group analysis, would underestimate the effect of interest. Taken together, the present findings provide empirical evidence that links in-scanner head motion to psychological traits.

Batch assays were conducted to ascertain the effects of ion species, and the results demonstrated the different effects on the specific anammox activity. Osmotic pressure was another determining factor with a 50% inhibitory level of 1.4 MPa. Self-adaptation strategies were conducted by running R-1 (gradual adaptation) and R-2 (rapid adaptation), and the nitrogen removal rates were 3.71 +/- 0.63 kg N m(-3) d(-1) (111) and 3.48 +/- 0.51 kg N m(-3) d(-1) (R-2) below 15 g NaCl L-1. Additionally, the NRR decreased significantly when the salinity was increased (more severe in R-2). Furthermore, the enhanced adaptation tests confirmed that extra biomass addition (EBA) in R-2 was effective to resist the salinity stress, whereas the effectiveness of glycine betaine addition (GBA) in R-3 was dubious.

Multigap nodeless superconductivity in nickel chalcogenide TlNi2Se2	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							HIGH-TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY	Low-temperature thermal conductivity measurements were performed on single crystals of TlNi2Se2, a nickel chalcogenide heavy-electron superconductor with T-c similar or equal to 3.7 K. In zero field, the residual electronic contribution at T -> 0 K (kappa(0)/T) was well separated from the total thermal conductivity, which is less than 0.45% of its normal-state value. Such a tiny residual kappa(0)/T is unlikely contributed by the nodal quasiparticles. The nodeless gap structure is supported by the very weak field dependence of kappa(0)(H)/T in low magnetic fields. In the whole field range, kappa(0)(H)/T exhibits an S-shaped curve, as in the case of nickel pnictides BaNi2As2 and SrNi2P2. This common feature of nickel-based superconductors can be explained by multiple nodeless superconducting gaps.	[Hong, X. C.; Zhang, Z.; Zhou, S. Y.; Pan, J.; Xu, Y.; Dong, J. K.; Li, S.

Despite its low carrier density, the relation between static internal field and Curie temperature observed for Li(Zn,Mn) P is consistent with the trend found in (Ga,Mn)As and other bulk DFSs, indicating these systems share a common mechanism for the ferromagnetic exchange interaction. Li1+y(Zn1-xMnx)P has the advantage of decoupled carrier and spin doping, where Mn2+ substitution for Zn2+ introduces spins and Li+ off-stoichiometry provides carriers. This advantage enables us to investigate the influence of overdoped Li on the ferromagnetic ordered state. Overdoping Li suppresses both T-C and saturation moments for a certain amount of spins, which indicates that more carriers are detrimental to the ferromagnetic exchange interaction, and that a delicate balance between charge and spin densities is required to achieve highest T-C.

Protonation at the carboxylic O atom results in the breakage of the ester C-O bond to afford the benzyl cation, which undergoes the competing migration to the amino N atom or the phenyl ring C atom. Both the amino and the phenyl ring hydrogen atoms can be activated to be mobile due to the electrophilic attack of the transferring benzyl cation, and migration of the activated hydrogen atom to the carboxylic hydroxyl leads to (H2O + CO) elimination of the precursor ion. Interestingly, it is much more preferred for the benzyl cation to transfer to the phenyl ring via the amino N, leading to the stepwise benzyl cation transfer, albeit the amino N atom contains more nucleophilic affinity. The mechanistic processes have been confirmed by the MS3 spectra data, along with D-labeling experiments and theoretical calculations. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of the length of the polyether chain, the amount of ionic liquid, and the reaction temperature on the catalytic performance of hydrosilylation have been investigated. Furthermore, the catalytic system has been tested for the hydrosilylation of different alkenes with triethoxysilane. The new catalytic system exhibits both excellent catalytic activity and selectivity under low-temperature conditions. The catalyst system could be recycled five times with slightly deactivation.

Herein, we report on the design and synthesis of BiVO4-rGO nanocomposites with efficient interfacial contact by self-assembly of positively charged amorphous BiVO4 powders with negatively charged graphene oxide (GO), followed by a one-step GO reduction and BiVO4 crystallization via hydrothermal treatment. The as-prepared BiVO4-rGO nanocomposites exhibit high visible light photocatalytic efficiency for the degradation of model dyes, and are significantly superior to bare crystalline BiVO4 and BiVO4-rGO-U that is hydrothermally synthesized using the mixture of GO nanosheets and BiVO, powders without modification of surface charge. Using multiple characterization techniques, we found that the enhanced photocatalytic performance of BiVO4-rGO arises from the synergistic effects between the microscopic crystal structure of BiVO4 with smaller particle size and more sufficient interfacial interaction between BiVO4 and graphene sheets, leading to increased photocatalytic reaction sites, extended photoresponding range, enhanced photogenerated charge separation, and transportation efficiency. This work may provide a rational and convenient strategy to construct highly efficient semiconductor-rGO nanocomposite photocatalysts with well-contacted interface toward environmental purification and solar energy conversion.

Comparative studies of density-functional approximations for light atoms in strong magnetic fields	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							GENERALIZED-GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; AB-INITIO CALCULATIONS; HARTREE-FOCK; GROUND-STATE; POSITIVE-ION; ELECTRON-GAS; HELIUM ATOM; BASIS-SETS; MOLECULES; HYDROGEN	For a wide range of magnetic fields, 0 <= B <= 2000 a.u., we present a systematic comparative study of the performance of different types of density-functional approximations in light atoms (2 <= Z <= 6). Local, generalized-gradient approximation (GGA; semilocal), and meta-GGA ground-state exchange-correlation (xc) functionals are compared on an equal footing with exact-exchange, Hartree-Fock (HF), and current-density-functional-theory (CDFT) approximations. Comparison also is made with published quantum Monte Carlo data. Though all approximations give qualitatively reasonable results, the exchange energies from local and GGA functionals are too negative for large B. Results from the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof ground-state GGA and Tao-Perdew-Staroverov-Scuseria (TPSS) ground-state meta-GGA functionals are very close. Because of confinement, self-interaction error in such functionals is more severe at large B than at B = 0, hence self-interaction correction is crucial. Exact exchange combined with the TPSS correlation functional results in a self-interaction-free (xc) functional, from which we obtain atomic energies of comparable accuracy to those from correlated wave-function methods. Specifically for the B and C atoms, we provide beyond-HF energies in a wide range of B fields. Fully self-consistent CDFT calculations were done with the Vignale-Rasolt-Geldart (VRG) functional in conjunction with the PW92 xc functional. Current effects turn out to be small, and the vorticity variable in the VRG functional diverges in some low-density regions. This part of the study suggests that nonlocal, self-interaction-free functionals may be better than local approximations as a starting point for CDFT functional construction and that some basic variable other than the vorticity could be helpful in making CDFT calculations practical.

For ABS, investigators have found many practical applications that require signer-attribute privacy. However, this approach is inadequate for handling scenarios in which the signing key is exposed due to viruses, worms or other break-ins that are allowed by operating-system holes. To overcome the limitation of existing ABS systems, we introduce the notion of an attribute-based key-insulated signature (ABKIS), in which signing keys are refreshed at discrete time periods via an interaction between the user and the helper (a physically-secure but computationally-limited device). We formalize this security model and propose a concrete ABKIS scheme, which is proven to be secure under the standard computational Diffie-Hellman assumption. Furthermore, as an application, a time-conditioned attribute-based proxy signature (TC-ABPS) is derived from our proposed ABKIS scheme. Another typical application of our scheme is for anonymous provider authentication in a bidirectional broadcasting service. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The complete genome of this virus was determined to comprise 7424 nucleotides, and the virus shared 40.4-45.1% identity with that of other badnaviruses. The genome encodes five open reading frames (ORFs) on the plus strand, which includes three conserved badnaviral ORFs. These results suggest that this virus is a new member of the genus Badnavirus in the family Caulimoviridae. The virus is tentatively named pagoda yellow mosaic associated virus (PYMAV). Phylogenetic analysis suggested that this virus together with gooseberry vein banding virus (GVBV) and grapevine vein-clearing virus (GVCV) forms a separate group that is distinct two other well characterized badnaviral groups. Additionally, the viral derived small RNA (vsRNA) profile of PYMAV was analyzed and compared with that of viruses within the same family. Results showed that the most abundant PYMAV vsRNAs were 21-nt, whereas other viruses in the same family have a predominance of 22- or 24-nt vsRNA. The percentage of sense PYMAV vsRNA was almost equal to that of antisense vsRNA, whereas vsRNAs of other viruses in the family display preferences toward the sense strand of their genome. Furthermore, PYMAV vsRNAs were symmetrically distributed along the genome with no obvious vsRNA generating hotspots. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Zhu, YH; Chen, SJ				Zhu, Yuhong; Chen, Shi-Jie			Many-body effect in ion binding to RNA	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SAM-I RIBOSWITCH; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TERTIARY STRUCTURE; FREE-ENERGIES; THERMODYNAMIC FRAMEWORK; CRYSTAL-STRUCTURE; KISSING COMPLEX; HELIX STABILITY; MAGNESIUM-IONS; SIMULATIONS	Ion-mediated electrostatic interactions play an important role in RNA folding stability. For a RNA in a solution with higher Mg2+ ion concentration, more counterions in the solution can bind to the RNA, causing a strong many-body coupling between the bound ions. The many-body effect can change the effective potential of mean force between the tightly bound ions. This effect tends to dampen ion binding and lower RNA folding stability. Neglecting the many-body effect leads to a systematic error (over-estimation) of RNA folding stability at high Mg2+ ion concentrations. Using the tightly bound ion model combined with a conformational ensemble model, we investigate the influence of the many-body effect on the ion-dependent RNA folding stability. Comparisons with the experimental data indicate that including the many-body effect led to much improved predictions for RNA folding stability at high Mg2+ ion concentrations. The results suggest that the many-body effect can be important for RNA folding in high concentrations of multivalent ions. Further investigation showed that the many-body effect can influence the spatial distribution of the tightly bound ions and the effect is more pronounced for compact RNA structures and structures prone to the formation of local clustering of ions.

However, very few studies are currently available on brain network dysfunctions in bulimia nervosa (BN). The somatosensory network is central in processing body-related stimuli and it may be altered in BN. The present study therefore aimed to investigate rs-FC in the somatosensory network in bulimic women. Methods: Sixteen medication-free women with BN (age = 23 +/- 5 years) and 18 matched controls (age = 23 3 years) underwent a functional magnetic resonance resting-state scan and assessment of eating disorder symptoms. Within-network and seed-based functional connectivity analyses were conducted to assess rs-FC within the somatosensory network and to other areas of the brain. Results: Bulimia nervosa patients showed a decreased rs-FC both within the somatosensory network (t = 9.0, df = 1, P = 0.005) and with posterior cingulate cortex and two visual areas (the right middle occipital gyrus and the right cuneus) (P = 0.05 corrected for multiple comparison). The rs-FC of the left paracentral lobule with the right middle occipital gyrus correlated with psychopathology measures like bulimia (r = 0.4; P = 0.02) and interoceptive awareness (r = 0.4; P = 0.01). Analyses were conducted using age, BMI (body mass index), and depressive symptoms as covariates. Conclusion: Our findings show a specific alteration of the rs-FC of the somatosensory cortex in BN patients, which correlates with eating disorder symptoms. The region in the right middle occipital gyrus is implicated in body processing and is known as extrastriate body area (EBA). The connectivity between the somatosensory cortex and the EBA might be related to dysfunctions in body image processing. The results should be considered preliminary due to the small sample size.

Methods: In vivo, BALB/c mice were exposed to smoke of 15 cigarettes for 1 h/day, 6 days/week for 3 months and dosed with icariin (25, 50 and 100 mg/kg) or dexamethasone (1 mg/kg). In vitro, A549 cells were incubated with icariin (10, 50 and 100 mu M) followed by treatments with CSE (2.5%). Results: We found that icariin significantly protected pulmonary function and attenuated CS-induced inflammatory response by decreasing inflammatory cells and production of TNF-alpha, IL-8 and MMP-9 in both the serum and BALF of CS-exposed mice and decreasing production of TNF-alpha and IL-8 in the supernatant of CSE-exposed A549 cells. Icariin also showed properties in inhibiting the phosphorylation of NF-kappa B p65 protein and blocking the degradation of IKB-alpha protein. Further studies revealed that icariin administration markedly restore CS-reduced GR protein and mRNA expression, which might subsequently contribute to the attenuation of CS-induced respiratory inflammatory response. Conclusion: Together these results suggest that icariin has anti-inflammatory effects in cigarette smoke induced inflammatory models in vivo and in vitro, possibly achieved by suppressing NF-kappa B activation and modulating GR protein expression.

J	Yin, QP				Yin Qiping			Cognition and Feelings in the Context of Values: The Canonicity of Seamus Heaney's Poems	FOREIGN LITERATURE STUDIES			Chinese	Article						Seamus Heaney; canonicity; the context of values; cognition; feelings		There is a prevalent view both at home and abroad that Heaney's great popularity derives from, rather than the quality inherent in his poems, such external factors as his concern for the issue of cultural identity which dovetails with some international academic trends and with the mainstream discourse within the circles of literary critics. The rationale behind this view is in fact part of a trend to de-canonize literary classics. The artistic vitality of Heaney's poems, however, defies the multifarious accounts which are exclusively concerned with the notion of canonization, but calls for an in-depth inquiry from the perspective of canonicity which, in the final analysis, lies in a judicious use of knowledge and a delicate handling of feelings in the context of values. For all the importance of cognition and feelings, the canonicity Of Heaney's poems would have lost its roots had they been divorced from their context of values.

In this reconstruction process, the (rough) velocity distribution reconstructed by using raw data from direct Dark Matter detection experiments directly, i.e. measured recoil energies, with one or more different target materials, has been used as "reconstructed-input" information. By assuming a fitting velocity distribution function and scanning the parameter space based on the Bayesian analysis, the astronomical characteristic parameters, e.g. the Solar and Earth's Galactic velocities, will be pinned down as the output results.

The genus includes many well-loved ornamental plants and valuable sources of traditional Chinese herbal medicines. Although popular and useful, their slow growth and vulnerability to environmental stress has strongly limited their more widespread adoption. The aim of our research is to expand the understanding of the regulation of Dendrobium growth and development. In this study, the gene encoding EREB5, a member of the APETALA2/ethylene-responsive element-binding protein (AP2/EREBP) family of transcription factors, was cloned from Dendrobium officinale. The full-length ORF of 558 bp, is predicted to code for a protein of 185 amino acids. The putative protein contains one copy of the well-conserved AP2 domain and a typical EAR motif, present in members of the ethylene response factor (ERF) subfamily. Arabidopsis thaliana plants ectopically expressing the DoEREB5 gene showed several phenotypic differences from wild-type plants, including altered leaf shape and petiole size. Expression of a DoEREB5 RNAi construct in Arabidopsis led to reduced levels of the putative Arabidopsis ortholog, AtERF9. Plants with reduced levels of AtERF9 showed an increase in chlorophyll content and photosynthetic rates compared to wild-type and heterologous ectopic DoEREB5 expression plants. Photosynthetic rates in the RNAi plants were higher than those in WT plants under both high and low light. Our results have provided clues as to the in vivo role of the Dendrobium gene, DoEREB5, suggesting that it is involved in the important processes of leaf development and function.

All purified enzymes showed activities toward the tested ketoesters with different activities. In the reduction of 4-phenyl-2-butanone with in situ NAD(P)H regeneration system, (S)-alcohol was obtained with an e.e. of up to 100% catalyzed by Gox0644. Under the same experimental condition, all enzymes catalyzed ethyl 4-chloroacetoacetate to give chiral products with an excellent e.e. of up to 99%, except Gox0644. Gox2036 had a strict requirement for NADH as the cofactor and showed excellent enantiospecificity in the synthesis of ethyl (R)-4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate. For the reduction of ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate, excellent e.e. (>99%) and high conversion (93.1%) were obtained by Gox0525, whereas the other enzymes showed relatively lower e.e. and conversions. Among them, Gox2036 and Gox0525 showed potentials in the synthesis of chiral alcohols as useful biocatalysts.

Our method first partitions an input shape into a set of segmentations as a data preparation, and then a linear integer programming algorithm is used to select segments from them to form the final optimal segmentation. The key idea is to maximize the segment similarity between the segments in the input shape and the segments in database, where the segment similarity is computed through sparse reconstruction error. The segment-level similarity enables to handle a large amount of shapes with significant topology or shape variations with a small set of segmented example shapes. Experimental results show that our algorithm can generate high quality segmentation and semantic labeling results in the Princeton segmentation benchmark.

One of the major reasons is their low tolerance to environmental changes. WRKY transcription factors are one of the largest families of transcriptional regulators in plants. They are involved in various biotic and abiotic stress responses. One DnWRKY11 gene was isolated from Dendrobium nobile. To explore the function of DnWRKY11 in Dendrobium defense responses to abiotic stress, it was overexpressed in tobacco. Under salt and drought stresses, the DnWRKY11 transgenic tobacco showed higher germination rate, longer root length, higher fresh weight, higher activities of catalase (CAT), peroxidase (POD), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and lower content of malonidialdehyde (MDA) than the wild type. These results proved the important roles of DnWRKY11 in plant response to drought and salt stresses, and provided a potential gene for improving environmental stress tolerance of Dendrobium seedlings.

The Cry alpha B R120G allele has been linked to a familial desminopathy and, in transgenic mice, causes a sudden death at about 28 weeks of age. To investigate the mechanisms of the sudden cardiac arrest of Cry alpha B R120G transgenic mice, we prepared protein samples from left ventricular tissues of two different age groups (10 and 28 weeks) and examined Ca2+-handling proteins. Expression of sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA) 2, phospholamban, ryanodine receptor 2 and calsequestrin 2 was significantly decreased in 28-versus 10-week-old Cry alpha B R120G transgenic mice. In addition, low heart rate variability, including heart rate, total power and low frequency, was observed and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring revealed cardiac arrhythmias, such as ventricular tachycardia, atrioventricular block and atrial flutter, in 28-week-old Cry alpha B R120G transgenic mice. In contrast, expression of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) degradation enhancing a-mannosidase-like protein, inositol requirement 1 and X-box binding protein 1 were increased significantly in 28-versus 10-week-old Cry alpha BR120G transgenic mice, suggesting that the Cry alpha BR120G transgenic mice exhibit increased ER stress compared with wild-type mice. Together, the data suggest that the Cry alpha B R120G dominant variant induces ER stress and impairs Ca2+ regulation, leading to ageing-related cardiac dysfunction, arrhythmias and decreased autonomic tone with shortened lifespan.

TNF-alpha gene polymorphisms can influence the TNF-alpha production. Many studies have focused the association between TNF-alpha gene promoter polymorphisms and periodontitis risk, but these results are still controversial. Materials and Methods: A meta-analysis was performed to assess the effect of TNF-alpha -308G/A (rs1800629), -238G/A (rs361525) and -863C/A (rs1800630) polymorphisms on either chronic (CP) or aggressive periodontitis (AgP) risk. Odds ratios (ORs) along with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to assess the strength of the association. Forty-six studies involving 5186 cases and 6683 controls were retrieved and analyzed. Results: The TNF-alpha -308G/A AA genotype was associated with increased CP risk in Asians, non-smoking Asians and Caucasians, and this polymorphism was significantly associated with elevated risk of AgP in Asians and Caucasians. Asian individuals carrying AA genotype had a significantly increased risk for -863C/A. No significant association was identified between TNF -238G/A polymorphism and CP. Conclusions: These findings supported that TNF-alpha -308G/A and -863C/A polymorphisms may contribute to the susceptibility of periodontitis.

The challenges we face are: 1) substantial random noise and corruption are present in low-resolution depth maps; and 2) there is high degree of variability in pose and face expression. We develop a novel two-stage algorithm that effectively maps low-quality depth maps to realistic face models. Each stage is targeted toward a certain type of noise. The first stage extracts sparse errors from depth patches through the data-driven local sparse coding, while the second stage smooths noise on the boundaries between patches and reconstructs the global shape by combining local shapes using our template-based surface refinement. Our approach does not require any markers or user interaction. We perform quantitative and qualitative evaluations on both synthetic and real test sets. Experimental results show that the proposed approach is able to produce high-resolution 3D face models with high accuracy, even if inputs are of low quality, and have large variations in viewpoint and face expression.

Cancer care studies showed that co-infection of KSHV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was able to increase the patients' survival, but the underlying mechanisms are still elusive. MethodsTo understand the mechanism underlying the prolonged survival in KSHV-HIV co-infected patients, we performed microarray analysis on RNA extracted from biopsies from KS tumors and adjacent healthy tissues in four KS patients. Subsequently, we performed hierarchical clustering, gene ontology (GO) and ingenuity pathway analysis. We then characterized the roles of tight junction protein claudin-2 in the endothelial barrier function. ResultsThree hundred and forty-three differentially expressed genes were identified, of which 246 genes exhibited significantly increased expression in the tumor compared to the adjacent healthy tissue and 97 genes showed downregulated expression, including claudin-2. Knockdown of claudin-2 in cultured endothelial cells enhances barrier function by altering the charge selectivity, but not the size selectivity. ConclusionClaudin-2 expression is decreased in KS tumors from patients co-infected with KSHV and HIV. Decreased claudin-2 enhances endothelial barrier function and may play a role in the prolonged survival of patients with KSHV and HIV co-infection.

In this paper, we demonstrate the adversarial model of this type of protocols and show that Hsieh-Leu scheme is not as secure as they originally claimed to be. In particular, we show that their protocol does not provide user privacy protection, and it is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack mounted by a side channel adversary who has compromised all the information stored in the user's smart card. To fix these weaknesses, a new practical authentication protocol with anonymity for wireless roaming is proposed. We use the formal verification tool ProVerif, which is based on applied pi calculus, to prove the security of the proposed scheme. The experimental results confirm that the new scheme not only achieves many desirable properties, such as strong anonymity, perfect forward secrecy and support of session key update, but also provides robustness against all those attacks that Hsieh-Leu protocol does not resist.

Heavy-fermion quantum criticality and destruction of the Kondo effect in a nickel oxypnictide	NATURE MATERIALS			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; RESISTIVITY; DEPENDENCE; PRESSURE	A quantum critical point arises at a continuous transformation between distinct phases of matter at zero temperature. Studies in antiferromagnetic heavy-fermion materials have revealed that quantum criticality has several classes, with an unconventional type that involves a critical destruction of the Kondo entanglement(1,2). To understand such varieties, it is important to extend the materials basis beyond the usual setting of intermetallic compounds. Here we show that a nickel oxypnictide, CeNiAsO, exhibits a heavy-fermion antiferromagnetic quantum critical point as a function of either pressure or P/As substitution. At the quantum critical point, non-Fermi-liquid behaviour appears, which is accompanied by a divergent effective carrier mass. Across the quantum critical point, the low-temperature Hall coefficient undergoes a rapid sign change, suggesting a sudden jump of the Fermi surface and a destruction of the Kondo effect(3,4). Our results imply that the enormous materials basis for the oxypnictides, which has been so crucial in the search for high-temperature superconductivity, will also play a vital role in the effort to establish the universality classes of quantum criticality in strongly correlated electron systems.

However, the mechanisms of UV-B-induced secondary metabolite production remained largely unknown. Here we report that UV-B treatment stimulated nitric oxide (NO) generation and camptothecin (CPT) production in Camptotheca acuminata cells. To investigate the origin of the UV-B-triggered NO and the role of NO in UV-B-induced CPT production, we assayed the responses of nitrate reductase (NR) and NO synthase (NOS) activities of the cells to UV-B exposure and examined the effects of NR and NOS inhibitors on CPT production in UV-B-treated cells. The data showed that UV-B irradiation enhanced NR activities in the cells. Pretreatment with NR inhibitors tungstate and okadaic acid not only suppressed the UV-B-triggered NR activities but also inhibited the UV-B-induced NO generation and CPT production in the cells. In contrast, UV-B irradiation had no effects on NOS activity of the cells and treatment of NOS inhibitor did not suppress UV-B-induced CAT production. Together, the results demonstrated that NR activity was essential for UV-B-triggered NO generation and that NR-mediated NO signaling was involved in UV-B-induced CPT production in C. acuminata cells.

While much is known about how clonality promotes plant fitness, we know little about how different clonal plants influence ecosystem functions related to carbon, nutrient and water cycling. Approach The response-effect trait framework is used to formulate hypotheses about the impact of clonality on ecosystems. Central to this framework is the degree of correspondence between interspecific variation in clonal 'response traits' that promote plant fitness and interspecific variation in 'effect traits', which define a plant's potential effect on ecosystem functions. The main example presented to illustrate this concept concerns clonal traits of vascular plant species that determine their lateral extension patterns. In combination with the different degrees of decomposability of litter derived from their spacers, leaves, roots and stems, these clonal traits should determine associated spatial and temporal patterns in soil organic matter accumulation, nutrient availability and water retention. Conclusions This review gives some concrete pointers as to how to implement this new research agenda through a combination of (1) standardized screening of predominant species in ecosystems for clonal response traits and for effect traits related to carbon, nutrient and water cycling; (2) analysing the overlap between variation in these response traits and effect traits across species; (3) linking spatial and temporal patterns of clonal species in the field to those for soil properties related to carbon, nutrient and water stocks and dynamics; and (4) studying the effects of biotic interactions and feedbacks between resource heterogeneity and clonality. Linking these to environmental changes may help us to better understand and predict the role of clonal plants in modulating impacts of climate change and human activities on ecosystem functions.

Based on the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) effect, the probe exhibits significant variation on emission wavelengths with shifts more than 100 nm after combined with Zn2+, in accordance with the conversion of emission colors from blue to green. Good selectivity and sensitivity of this probe towards Zn2+ can be found even on the ppb level in aqueous solution. The Job's plot test suggests a 1:1 stoichiometry between ZC-F7 and Zn2+. The application of the fluorescence probe in bio-imaging is also demonstrated, proving its potential usage in fields such as environment protection, water treatment and safety inspection.

In this letter, we evaluate the performance of HY-2 scatterometer data for monitoring Saola, Haikui, and Usagi typhoons, and consider QuikSCAT data for Florence, Ioke, and Gorden hurricanes. We use the means and standard deviation of the great circle distance to assess the typhoon track, and the t-test, mean error, and scatter index to evaluate the accuracy of typhoon intensity. Our results show that the HY-2 has the ability similar to that of QuikSCAT, suggesting that HY-2 has potential for application in typhoon monitoring.

China's rapid urban development has resulted in unprecedented urban population growth and built-up area expansion, but its effects on urban morphology and mobility are only partly understood. City compactness can be measured simply using urban spatial form or morphology: the more concentrated the built-up area, the more compact the city is. Here we show that 35 major cities in China are not compact in spatial form and that their compactness is not improving over time. Our results reveal close correlations between changes in urbanization rate and changes in city compactness as well as between city compactness and commuting time (CT), indicating that the high rate of urbanization without adequate planning has contributed to the poor compactness of Chinese cities, which has further increased CT. We suggest that continuing urban sprawl with low land use efficiency and low urban form compactness will make cities in China more congested and threaten China's sustainable urbanization.

Although various supramolecular networks are constructed by supramolecular chemists based on different non-covalent interactions, supramolecular polymer networks based on multiple orthogonal interactions are still rare. Here, a supramolecular polymer network is presented on the basis of the host-guest interactions between dibenzo-24-crown-8 (DB24C8) and dibenzylammonium salts (DBAS), the metal-ligand coordination interactions between terpyridine and Zn(OTf)(2), and between 1,2,3-triazole and PdCl2(PhCN)(2). The topology of the networks can be easily tuned from monomer to main-chain supramolecular polymer and then to the supramolecular networks. This process is well studied by various characterization methods such as H-1 NMR, UV-vis, DOSY, viscosity, and rheological measurements. More importantly, a supramolecular gel is obtained at high concentrations of the supramolecular networks, which demonstrates both stimuli-responsiveness and self-healing properties.

J	Chen, HY; Nicholson, WK				Chen, Huanyin; Nicholson, W. K.			Stable modules and a theorem of Camillo and Yu	JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED ALGEBRA			English	Article							REGULAR-RINGS; IDEMPOTENTS	In 1995, Camillo and Yu showed that an exchange ring has stable range 1 if and only if every regular element is unit-regular. An element m in a module R-M is called regular if (m lambda)m = m for some lambda epsilon hom(M, R). In this paper we define stable modules and show that if M has the finite exchange property then M is stable if and only if, for every regular element m E M, (my)m = m where gamma : M -> R is epic (and we say that m is unit-regular). Such modules are called regular-stable. It is shown that R R is regular-stable if and only if R has internal cancellation. To simplify the exposition, many arguments are formulated in an arbitrary Morita context.	[Chen, Huanyin] Hangzhou Normal Univ, Dept Math, Hangzhou 310036, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Nicholson, W.

BESIII Collaboration	Study of e(+)e(-) -> p(p)over-bar in the vicinity of psi(3770)	PHYSICS LETTERS B			English	Article						BESIII; Charmonium decay; Proton form factor	BRANCHING FRACTION; E&E-ANNIHILATION; CHARM THRESHOLD; CROSS-SECTIONS	Using 2917 pb(-1) of data accumulated at 3.773 GeV, 44.5 pb(-1) of data accumulated at 3.65 GeV and data accumulated during a psi(3770) line-shape scan with the BESIII detector, the reaction e(+)e(-) -> p (p) over bar is studied considering a possible interference between resonant and continuum amplitudes. The cross section of e(+)e(-) -> psi(3770) -> p (p) over bar, sigma(e(+)e(-)-> psi(3770) -> p (p) over bar), is found to have two solutions, determined to be (0.059(-0.020)(+0.070) +/- 0.012) pb with the phase angle phi = (255.8(-26.6)(+39.0) +/- 4.8). (< 0.166 pb at the 90% confidence level), or sigma(e(+)e(-) -> psi(3770) -> p<(p)over bar>) = (2.57(-0.13)(+0.12) +/- 0.12) pb with phi = (266.9(-6.3)(+6.1) +/- 0.9)degrees both of which agree with a destructive interference. Using the obtained cross section of psi(3770) -> p (p) over bar, the cross section of p (p) over bar -> psi(3770), which is useful information for the future PANDA experiment, is estimated to be either (9.8(-3.9)(+11.8)) nb (< 27.5 nb at 90% C.L.) or (425.6(-43.7)(+42.9)) nb.

Does reciprocal link and non-reciprocal link play the same role? Previous researches haven't displayed a clear picture to us until now according to the best of our knowledge. Motivated by this, in this paper, we empirically study the influence of reciprocal links in two representative real datasets, Sina Weibo and Douban. Our results demonstrate that the reciprocal links play a more important role than non-reciprocal ones in information diffusion process. In particular, not only coverage but also the speed of the information diffusion can be significantly enhanced by considering the reciprocal effect. We give some possible explanations from the perspectives of network connectivity and efficiency. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding and application of the reciprocal effect in directed online social networks.

However, the molecular mechanisms limiting sensory formation to this discrete region in the ventral cochlear duct are not well understood, nor is it known whether other regions of the cochlea have the competence to form the organ of Corti. Here we identify LMO4, a LIM-domain-only nuclear protein, as a negative regulator of sensory organ formation in the cochlea. Inactivation of Lmo4 in mice leads to an ectopic organ of Corti (eOC) located in the lateral cochlea. The eOC retains the features of the native organ, including inner and outer hair cells, supporting cells, and other nonsensory specialized cell types. However, the eOC shows an orientation opposite to the native organ, such that the eOC appears as a mirror-image duplication to the native organ of Corti. These data demonstrate a novel sensory competent region in the lateral cochlear duct that is regulated by LMO4 and may be amenable to therapeutic manipulation.

Anonymous Three-Party Password-Authenticated Key Exchange Scheme for Telecare Medical Information Systems	PLOS ONE			English	Article							PROTOCOL; CRYPTANALYSIS; EFFICIENT; SECURE	Telecare Medical Information Systems (TMIS) provide an effective way to enhance the medical process between doctors, nurses and patients. For enhancing the security and privacy of TMIS, it is important while challenging to enhance the TMIS so that a patient and a doctor can perform mutual authentication and session key establishment using a third-party medical server while the privacy of the patient can be ensured. In this paper, we propose an anonymous three-party password-authenticated key exchange (3PAKE) protocol for TMIS. The protocol is based on the efficient elliptic curve cryptosystem. For security, we apply the pi calculus based formal verification tool ProVerif to show that our 3PAKE protocol for TMIS can provide anonymity for patient and doctor while at the same time achieves mutual authentication and session key security. The proposed scheme is secure and efficient, and can be used in TMIS.

The TCG is implemented at the switch level with a simple structure of 24 MOS transistors and simulated at the layout level using the HSPICE software with TSMC 0.18 mu m CMOS technology, showing that it works properly. The analyses show that the proposed TCG not only can output a ternary clock of high quality, meeting the clock's design requirements, but also can be fabricated with standard CMOS technology.

However, the use of different stimuli changes the frequency of visual fixation occured in patients, thereby possibly affecting the accuracy of the diagnosis. In order to establish a standardized assessment of visual fixation in patients in disorders of consciousness (DOC), we compared the frequency of visual fixation elicited by mirror, a ball and a light. Method: Visual fixation was assessed in eighty-one post-comatose patients diagnosed with a MCS or VS/UWS. Occurrence of fixation to different stimuli was analysis used Chi-square testing. Result: 40 (49%) out of the 81 patients showed fixation to visual stimuli. Among those, significantly more patients (39, 48%) had visual fixation elicited by mirror compared to a ball (23, 28%) and mirror compared to a light (20, 25%). Conclusion: The use of a mirror during the assessment of visual fixation showed higher positive response rate, compared to other stimuli in eliciting a visual fixating response. Therefore, fixation elicited by a mirror can be a very sensitive and accurate test to differentiate the two disorders of consciousness.

The evolution of first names of newborn babies offers a remarkable example for such researches. In this paper, we employ the historical data on baby names from the United States to investigate the evolutionary process of culture, in particular focusing on how inequality among baby names changes over time. Then we propose a stochastic model where individual choice is determined by both individual preference and social influence, and show that the decrease in the strength of social influence can account for all the observed empirical features. Therefore, we claim that the weakening of social influence drives cultural evolution. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

CysLTs mediate their biological actions through activating CysLT receptors (CysLT(1)R and CysLT(2)R). We have recently reported that 5-LOX and CysLT(1)R mediated PC12 cell injury induced by high concentrations of rotenone (0.3-10 mu M), which was reduced by the selective 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton and CysLT(1)R antagonist montelukast. The purpose of this study was to examine the regulatory roles of the 5-LOX/CysLT(1)R pathway in microglial activation induced by low concentration rotenone. After mouse microglial BV2 cells were stimulated with rotenone (0.3-3 nM), phagocytosis and release of pro-inflammatory cytokine were assayed as indicators of microglial activation. We found that rotenone (1 and 3 nM) increased BV2 microglial phagocytosis and the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Zileuton and montelukast prevented rotenone (3 nM)-induced phagocytosis and cytokine release. Furthermore, rotenone significantly up-regulated 5-LOX expression, induced 5-LOX translocation to the nuclear envelope, and increased the production of CysLTs. These responses were inhibited by zileuton. Rotenone also increased CysLT(1)R expression and induced nuclear translocation of CysLT(1)R. In primary rat microglia, rotenone (10 nM) increased release of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha, whereas zileuton (0.1 mu M) and montelukast (0.01 mu M) significantly inhibited this response. These results indicated that 5-LOX and CysLT(1)R might be key regulators of microglial activation induced by low concentration of rotenone. Interference of 5-LOX/CysLT(1)R pathway may be an effective therapeutic strategy for microglial inflammation. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Inspired by the edge histogram descriptor proposed in MPEG-7, this paper presents an efficient orientation-based local descriptor, named histogram of salient edge orientation map (HSEOM). HSEOM is based on the fact that human vision is sensitive to edge features for image perception. For a given image, HSEOM first finds oriented edge maps according to predefined orientations using a well-known edge operator and obtains a salient edge orientation map by choosing an orientation with the maximum edge magnitude for each pixel. Then, sub-histograms of the salient edge orientation map are generated from the nonoverlapping submaps and concatenated to build the final HSEOM. In the experiment of this paper, eight oriented edge maps were used to generate a salient edge orientation map for HSEOM construction. Experimental results on our available finger vein image database, MMCBNU_6000, show that the performance of HSEOM outperforms that of state-of-the-art orientation-based methods (e.g., Gabor filter, histogram of oriented gradients, and local directional code). Furthermore, the proposed HSEOM has advantages of low feature dimensionality and fast implementation for a real-time finger vein recognition system.

Filtering algorithm, based on the coupled social networks, considers the effects of both social similarity and personalized preference. Experimental results based on two real datasets, Epinions and Friendfeed, show that the hybrid pattern can not only provide more accurate recommendations, but also enlarge the recommendation coverage while adopting global metric. Further empirical analyses demonstrate that the mutual reinforcement and rich-club phenomenon can also be found in coupled social networks where the identical individuals occupy the core position of the online system. This work may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of the structure and function of coupled social networks.

J	Yuan, BK; Wang, J; Zang, YF; Liu, DQ				Yuan, Bin-Ke; Wang, Jue; Zang, Yu-Feng; Liu, Dong-Qiang			Amplitude differences in high-frequency fMRI signals between eyes open and eyes closed resting states	FRONTIERS IN HUMAN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						resting state fMRI; high-frequency fluctuations; fluctuation amplitude; eyes open; eyes closed	DEFAULT MODE NETWORK; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN ACTIVITY; GLOBAL SIGNAL; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BOLD OSCILLATIONS; TIME-SERIES; CORTEX; MRI; PAIN	Recent studies employing rapid sampling techniques have demonstrated that the resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signal exhibits synchronized activities at frequencies much higher than the conventional frequency range (<0.1 Hz). However, little work has investigated the changes in the high-frequency fluctuations between different resting states. Here, we acquired rs-fMRI data at a high sampling rate (TA = 400 ms) from subjects with both eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), and compared the amplitude of fluctuation (AF) between EO and EC for both the low- and high-frequency components. In addition to robust AF differences in the conventional low frequency band (<0.1 Hz) in visual cortex, primary auditory cortex and primary sensorimotor cortex (PSMC), we also detected high-frequency (primarily in 0.1-0.35 Hz) differences. The high-frequency results without covariates regression exhibited noisy patterns. For the data with nuisance covariates regression, we found a significant and reproducible reduction in high-frequency AF between EO and EC in the bilateral PSMC and the supplementary motor area (SMA), and an increase in high-frequency AF in the left middle occipital gyrus (MOG). Furthermore, we investigated the effect of sampling rate by down sampling the data to effective TA = 2 s. Briefly, by using the rapid sampling rate, we were able to detect more regions with significant differences while identifying fewer artifactual differences in the high-frequency bands as compared to the down-sampled dataset. We concluded that (1) high-frequency fluctuations of rs-fMRI signals can be modulated by different resting states and thus may be of physiological importance; and (2) the regression of covariates and the use of fast sampling rates are superior for revealing high-frequency differences in rs-fMRI signals.

METHODS: This retrospective analysis compared the treatment efficacy of PEG-IFN-alpha 2b alone in 55 HBeAg-positive CHB patients with different baseline HBsAg levels. Serum HBV DNA load was measured at baseline, and at 12, 24 and 48 wk of therapy. Virological response was defined as HBV DNA < 1000 IU/mL. Serum HBsAg titers were quantitatively assayed at baseline, and at 12 and 24 wk. RESULTS: Eighteen patients had baseline HBsAg > 20 000 IU/mL, 26 patients had 1500-20000 IU/mL, and 11 patients had < 1500 IU/mL. Three (16.7%), 11 (42.3%) and seven (63.6%) patients in each group achieved a virological response at week 48, with a significant difference between groups with baseline HBsAg levels > 20000 or < 20000 IU/mL (P = 0.02). Thirteen patients had an HBsAg decline > 0.5 log10 and 30 patients < 0.5 log10 at week 12; and 6 (46.2%) and 10 (33.3%) in each group achieved virological response at week 48, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.502). Eighteen patients had an HBsAg decline > 1.0 log10 and 30 patients < 1.0 log10 at week 24, and 8 (44.4%) and 11 (36.7%) achieved a virological response at week 48, with no significant difference between the two groups (P = 0.762). None of the 16 patients with HBsAg > 20000 IU/mL at week 24 achieved a virological response at week 48. CONCLUSION: Baseline HBsAg level in combination with HBV DNA may become an effective predictor for guiding optimal therapy with PEG-IFN-a2b against HBeAg-positive CHB.

BESIII Collaboration	Precision measurement of the mass of the tau lepton	PHYSICAL REVIEW D			English	Article							RADIATIVE-CORRECTIONS	An energy scan near the tau pair production threshold has been performed using the BESIII detector. About 24 pb(-1) of data, distributed over four scan points, were collected. This analysis is based on t pair decays to ee, e mu, eh, h, hh, e.,. and p. final states, where h denotes a charged p or K. The mass of the t lepton is measured from a maximum likelihood fit to the t pair production cross- section data to be m(tau) = 1776.91 +/- 0.12_0.10 - 0.13 _ MeV/c(2), which is currently the most precise value in a single measurement.

In the current study, we investigate the functional impact of this sensitivity on attentional orienting in young children. We found that children as early as 4 years old, like adults, showed a robust reflexive attentional orienting effect to the walking direction of an upright point-light walker, indicating that biological motion signals can automatically direct spatial attention at an early age. More importantly, the inversion effect associated with attentional orienting emerges by 4 years old and gradually develops into a similar pattern found in adults. These results provide strong evidence that biological motion cues can guide the distribution of spatial attention in young children, and highlight a critical development from a broadly-to finely-tuned process of utilizing biological motion cues in the human social brain.

Nonsteady dynamic properties of a domain wall for the creep state under an alternating driving field	PHYSICAL REVIEW E			English	Article							ROUGHNESS EXPONENT; DISORDERED MEDIA; ISING-MODEL; INTERFACE; MOTION; UNIVERSALITY; SYSTEMS	With Monte Carlo simulations, the nonsteady dynamic properties of a domain wall have been systematically investigated for the thermally activated creep state under an alternating driving field. Taking the driven random-field Ising model in two dimensions as an example, two distinct growth stages of the domain interface are identified with both the correlation length and roughness function. One stage belongs to the universality class of the random depositions, and the other to that of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation. In the latter case, due to the dynamic effect of overhangs, the domain interface may exhibit an intrinsic anomalous scaling behavior, different from that of the quenched Edwards-Wilkinson equation.

In many types of non-aqueous media, such as ionic liquids, supercritical fluids, fluorous solvents etc., substrates and products are soluble and are therefore able to diffuse during reactions, which might often be beneficial to the lipase activity. Lipases often exhibit higher activity and stability in non-aqueous media than in aqueous environments. In addition, after reactions are carried out in novel media, a simple separation procedure might be included with the reaction process to facilitate improved purification of the products without using chromatographic separation or liquid-liquid extraction. This review focuses on novel medium for lipase catalysis, such as fluorous solvents, ionic liquids, supercritical fluids, etc. Some future perspectives and challenges facing in the media for enzymatic synthesis with lipase are also proposed.

Face to face communication is the most efficient way to cultivate the competence of cross-cultural awareness and collaboration. However, there are very few opportunities currently available for university students to have such face to face communication. Therefore, cross-cultural online collaborative learning utilizing web 2.0 technologies is proposed in this paper as a way to cultivate students' cross-cultural competence. The purpose of the study is therefore to elicit strategies for smooth and effective cross-cultural online collaborative learning through a pilot study between the West and the East. Students of a Chinese University and an American University took part in the study. A mixed method research approach using questionnaire, interview and content analysis was used. The findings of the study revealed that students from both sides were interested in each other's culture, their attitudes to cross-cultural online collaborative learning were positive, and culture had an influence on learning methods. Social interaction played an important role, and students preferred to have more prior knowledge of each other's cultures and backgrounds. They were also inclined towards more in-depth individual conversations. As a result of this study, several strategies are proposed to facilitate effective implementation of cross-cultural collaborative learning in typical higher education settings.

Selective cross-repressive interactions between pairs of class I and class II transcription factors play important roles in patterning neural progenitors into domains with clear boundaries. Here, we provide evidence that the zinc-finger protein Sp8 plays a supplementary role to Pax6 in establishing the pMN/p3 domain boundary through mutually repressive interactions with the class II protein Nkx2-2. The ventral limit of Sp8 expression is complementary to the dorsal limit of Nkx2-2 expression at the pMN/p3 boundary. Sp8 and Nkx2-2 exert cross-repressive interactions, and changing the expression of Sp8 and Nkx2-2 is coupled with pMN and p3 progenitor fate conversion. Sp8 exerts its neural patterning activities by acting as a transcriptional activator. The expression of a repressive form of Sp8 results in the selective inhibition of motor neuron generation and the ectopic induction of Nkx2-2 expression. Sp8 expression is positively regulated by, but not completely dependent on, Pax6. Furthermore, whereas loss of Pax6 function alone results in disruption of the pMN/p3 domain boundary only in the rostral levels of the spinal cord, loss of both Sp8 and Pax6 functions results in disruption of the pMN/p3 domain boundary along the whole rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord. We conclude that Sp8 plays a supplementary role to Pax6 in specifying the pMN over p3 progenitor fate through cross-repressive interactions with Nkx2-2.

However, thermoregulatory behavior was discovered only recently in turtle embryos, and the cost of this interesting behavior remains unknown. We manipulated the intensity of thermoregulatory behavior in turtle embryos (Pelodiscus sinensis) and determined the hatching success, body mass, and righting response to assess the energetic cost associated with this behavior. Hatchlings from embryos that had experienced intensive behavioral thermoregulation were smaller and contained less energy than those from the control group, which indicates that behavioral thermoregulation by turtle embryos incurs energetic costs. Nonetheless, the smaller hatchings did not exhibit a lower hatching success or a slower righting response, suggesting that the cost incurred by behavioral thermoregulation is relatively low in turtle embryos.

Recently, we have found that the simple axial chiral monoalkylated BINOLs could be converted into synthetically useful and enantiomerically pure 1,1'-binaphthalene-2-alpha-arylmethanol-2'-ols (Ar-BINMOLs) with axial and sp(3)-central chirality through the axial-to-central chirality transfer of [1,2]-Wittig rearrangement. At present, the catalytic application of Ar-BINMOLs in asymmetric catalysis has been revealed by our and Yus's groups. In this account, the progress in the field of BINOL and its derivatives will also be reported concisely in the article, and the Ar-BINMOLs and its derivatives as new chiral ligands for application in asymmetric catalysis would be summarized detailedly.

RHM is not widely used because its parameters, namely, quantum yield (alpha) and maximum photosynthetic rate (P-m), vary temporally with temperature and spatially with vegetation type under natural conditions. In the study, we present a temperature-and vegetation-type-adapted RHM by linking it to the Baldocchi's model to obtain the relationship between alpha-P-m and V-cmax,(25)-temperature to overcome the shortcomings of traditional RHM. The modified RHM (MRHM) coupled with a two-leaf upscaling strategy makes it possible to accurate and fast estimation of GPP at large scale. Twenty-two CO2 eddy-covariance sites with different vegetation types, including evergreen needleleaf forest, deciduous broadleaf forest, grassland, and evergreen broadleaf forest, are used to evaluate the performance of MRHM for GPP estimation. The comparisons of the simulated GPP using MRHM with measured and Boreal Ecosystem Productivity Simulator-simulated GPP demonstrate that the MRHM can simulate GPP as accurately as PBM and in the meantime with the advantage of simplicity as LUE model. These results show the promising potential of MRHM for accurately simulating GPP with relative high computational efficiency, providing an ideal alternative tool for large-scale and long time series GPP simulations.

Solving this problem using classic iterative methods (e.g., Newton-Raphson methods), however, often suffers from slow convergence toward a desired solution. In this paper, we propose an asymptotic numerical method that exploits the underlying mathematical structure of specific nonlinear material models, and thus runs orders of magnitude faster than traditional Newton-type methods. We apply this method to compute rest shapes for elastic fabrication, where the rest shape of an elastic object is computed such that after physical fabrication the real object deforms into a desired shape. We illustrate the performance and robustness of our method through a series of elastic fabrication experiments.

Given an input pose, it synthesizes a clothing deformation by blending skinned clothing deformations of nearby examples controlled by the body skeleton. Observing that cloth deformation can be well modeled with sensitivity analysis driven by the underlying skeleton, we introduce a sensitivity based method to construct a pose-dependent rigging solution from sparse examples. We also develop a sensitivity based blending scheme to find nearby examples for the input pose and evaluate their contributions to the result. Finally, we propose a stochastic optimization based greedy scheme for sampling the pose space and generating example clothing shapes. Our solution is fast, compact and can generate realistic clothing animation results for various kinds of clothes in real time.

Previous research revealed that the miR396 target module regulates cell proliferation and plays a critical role in leaf development. However, no additional biological functions of miR396 have been investigated in detail. In this study, T-DNA insertion mutants and transgenic plants with altered levels of miR396 or its target genes were used to characterize the regulatory role of miR396 in root development. We found that AtMIR396a was the predominant source for miR396 accumulation in the roots of seedlings, and that the mir396a-1 mutant had longer roots than wild-type seedlings. Overexpression of AtMIR396a decreased the transcript levels of target genes such as GRF genes and bHLH74, and resulted in a shorter root phenotype. Furthermore, the bhIh74-1 mutant had shorter roots, whereas overexpression of an miR396-resistant form of bHLH74 (mbHLH74) had an enhanced root growth phenotype. Moreover, MIR396a regulated root growth by affecting the elongation zone. Taken together, these data indicate that miR396a-mediated bHLH74 repression helps regulate root growth in Arabidopsis seedlings.

Recent studies challenge this dogma, suggesting that ageing does not occur in some animal species. In mammals, cell replicative senescence occurs as early as before birth (i.e. in embryos) under physiological conditions. How the molecular machinery operates and why ageing cells dominate under some circumstances are intriguing questions. Recent studies show that cell ageing involves extensive cellular remodelling, including telomere attrition, heterochromatin formation, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial disorders and lysosome processing organelles and chromatins. This article provides an update on the molecular mechanisms underlying the ageing of various cell types, the newly described developmental and programmed replicative senescence and the critical roles of cellular organelles and effectors in Parkinson's disease, diabetes, hypertension and dyskeratosis congenita.

Both TLR4 wild-type (WT) and mutant (TLR4(mut)) mice were fed either standard chow (SC) or the HFHFr diet for different periods of time from 4 to 16 weeks. Pathological characteristics and function of the liver were assessed. Simple steatosis, steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis occurred sequentially in Week 4, 8 and 16 in WT mice fed with the HFHFr. Expression of TLR4, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 3 and IRF7 started to increase at Week 4, peaked at Week 8 and then declined to basal levels at Week 16. This pattern was consistent with changes in inflammation in the liver revealed by haematoxylin and eosin staining. However, lipid accumulation, inflammation and fibrosis in livers of TLR4(mut) mice fed the HFHFr diet were significantly alleviated. In addition, the expression of activin A in WT mice fed the HFHFr diet increased at Week 16. The data suggest that TLR4 signalling mediates non-alcoholic steatohepatitis before fibrosis and that activin A is subsequently involved in NAFLD.

A method of dominant phase advanced driving (DPAD) is introduced to reveal the dynamic structures in the networks supporting oscillations, such as the oscillation sources and the main excitation propagation paths from the sources to the whole networks. The target center nodes and their drivers are regarded as the key nodes which can completely determine the corresponding target wave patterns. Therefore, the center (say node A) and its driver (say node B) of a target wave can be used as a label, (A, B), of the given target pattern. The label can give a clue to conveniently retrieve, suppress, and control the target waves. Statistical investigations, both theoretically from the label analysis and numerically from direct simulations of network dynamics, show that there exist huge numbers of target wave attractors in excitable complex networks if the system size is large, and all these attractors can be labeled and easily controlled based on the information given by the labels. The possible applications of the physical ideas and the mathematical methods about multiplicity and labelability of attractors to memory problems of neural networks are briefly discussed.

Materials and Methods: GTP/LTP was given 5-times weekly by oral gavage with tea polyphenols equivalent to 0-, 40- and 400-mg/kg of body weight/day. GTP/LTP treatment was started 2 weeks prior to the initiation of DEN and continued for 30 weeks. Results: Histopathological and electron microscopic examination of liver tissue confirmed the protective effect of LTP on DEN/PB-induced liver damage and pre-carcinogenesis. LTP treatment significantly increased total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity in liver tissues. Immunohistochemical detection of cellular nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and peroxiredoxin-6 (P6) indicated a down-regulation in Nrf2 and up-regulation of P6 expression in the liver of LTP-supplemented rats. Conclusion: The present study provides evidence for the first time, that LTP exerts significant antioxidant effects on DEN/PB-induced liver damage and hepatocarcinogenesis through elevating T-AOC levels, enhancing GSH-Px activity and inducing P6 expression in rat liver tissues.

Formation of silica capsules under acidic conditions proceeded via internal phase separation of silica species in the droplets. This mechanism is different from the well-known interfacial reaction mechanism for most syntheses of silica capsules. The driving force for the formation of capsules was the interaction between silica species and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) as well as between silica species and the hydrophilic block of the block copolymer surfactant, poly(ethylene-co-butylene)-b-poly(ethylene oxide) (P(E/B)-PEO). The effects of synthetic parameters on the particle morphology and size were systematically investigated in terms of the reaction time, amount of TEOS, CTAB, P(E/B)-PEO, and hydrochloric acid concentration, as well as addition of ethanol.

The bio-augmentation was applied together with shock test, with OTC shock concentration of 518 mg L-1 and 1-h duration. 0.655-2.62 g volatile suspended solid (VSS) sludges were varied to optimize bio-augmentation dosage (BAD), and appropriate bio-augmentation time (BAT) was determined. The validity of the bio-augmentation was indicated by recovery performance and sludge characteristics. The restoring time of 38 h for bio-augmented reactor was shorter than that of non-bio-augmented reactor (45 h), and heme c content was increased respectively from 0.195 +/- 0.001, 0.267 +/- 0.047, 0.301 +/- 0.049, to 0.340 +/- 0.053 mu mol g(-1) VSS with the BAD of 0.655, 1.31, 1.97, 2.62 g-VSS. The results suggest that bio-augmentation enhances the recovery of ANAMMOX performance following OTC shock and BAT and BAD are key operational factors. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This mutant exhibited spontaneous disease-like lesions in the absence of pathogen attack at the beginning of the tillering stage. Moreover, at the booting stage, lmes1 mutants exhibited a significantly increased MDA but decreased chlorophyll content, soluble protein content and photosynthetic rate in the leaves, which are indicative of an early senescence phenotype. The lmes1 mutant was significantly more resistant than 93-11 against rice bacterial blight infection, which was consistent with a marked increase in the expression of three resistance-related genes. Here, we employed a map-based cloning approach to finely map the lmes1 gene. In an initial mapping with 94 F-2 individuals derived from a cross between the lmes1 mutant and Nipponbare, the lmes1 gene was located in a 10.6-cM region on the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 7 using simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. To finely map lmes1, we derived two F-2 populations with 940 individuals from two crosses between the lmes1 mutant and two japonica rice varieties, Nipponbare and 02428. Finally, the lmes1 gene was mapped to an 88-kb region between two newly developed inDel markers, Zl-3 and Zl-22, which harbored 15 ORFs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

We recruited 304 patients who were histologically diagnosed as advanced NSCLC (IIIa, IIIb, and IV stage) in our hospital from September 2003 to January 2008. We also enrolled 409 sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers as controls. RECK Gene Polymorphisms were determined. Only the genotype distributions and allele frequencies of rs10814325 T > C were significantly different between NSCLC and controls (both P < 0.001). By multivariate analyses, markedly higher risk for NSCLC was observed in rs10814325 CC genotype (adjusted OR = 2.302, P = 0.012, with TT as reference) after adjustment with age, sex, smoking status, histology, differentiation, and stage. Haplotypes analyses showed that the A(rs11788747)-G(rs16932912)-C-rs10814325 and A(rs11788747)-A(rs16932912A)-C-rs10814325 were associated with higher risk for NSCLC; however, G(rs11788747)-G(rs16932912)-T-rs10814325 and G(rs11788747)-A(rs16932912)-T-rs10814325 haplotypes showed significantly protective roles in the NSCLC risk. The genotype and the allele frequencies of RECK gene were not significantly different between chemotherapy responder and non-responders. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed no association between the RECK polymorphism and chemotherapy response status in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study documenting the etiological role of RECK genetic polymorphisms in NSCLC.

J	Zhou, JZ; Xi, P; Zhou, Q; Ding, DQ; Cong, YS				Zhou, Junzhi; Xi, Peng; Zhou, Qi; Ding, Deqiang; Cong, Yusheng			The putative tumor suppressor C53 interacts with the human telomerase reverse transcriptase hTERT and regulates telomerase activity	CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN			English	Article						C53; hTERT; Tumor suppressor; Telomerase	BINDING-PROTEIN; CDK5 ACTIVATOR; CANCER; LZAP; ASSOCIATION; LIGASE; HDM2	Telomerase is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that contains a catalytic telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) and an RNA template. Telomerase activity is tightly controlled by TERT expression, which is regulated at both the transcriptional and post-translational levels. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms of telomerase regulation and function are not fully understood. To identify cofactors that contribute to telomerase regulation, we employed a yeast two-hybrid system to screen for hTERT-interacting proteins, using the hTERT T-motif as bait. We identify C53 as a novel hTERT interaction partner. We show that C53 interacts with hTERT both in vivo and in vitro. C53 depletion increases telomerase activity, and C53 overexpression inhibits telomerase activity in MCF7 cells. In addition, the C53 leucine zipper domain (amino acids 301-400) is required for interaction with hTERT. Deleting the leucine zipper domain eliminates C53 interaction with hTERT and abrogates its inhibitory effect on telomerase activity. Taken together, our results demonstrate that C53 is a novel hTERT-associated protein that negatively regulates telomerase activity.

The biological roles of the proteasome activator REG gamma are not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that REG gamma controls degradation of protein kinase A catalytic subunit-alpha(PKAca) both in primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) and mouse embryonic fibroblast cells (MEFs). Accumulation of PKAca in REG gamma-deficient HUVECs or MEFs results in phosphorylation and nuclear exclusion of the transcription factor FoxO1, indicating that REG gamma is involved in preserving FoxO1 transcriptional activity. Consequently, VEGF-induced expression of the FoxO1 responsive genes, VCAM-1 and E-Selectin, was tightly controlled by REG gamma in a PKA dependent manner. Functionally, REG gamma is crucial for the migration of HUVECs. REG gamma(-/-) mice display compromised VEGF-instigated neovascularization in cornea and aortic ring models. Implanted matrigel plugs containing VEGF in REG gamma(-/-) mice induced fewer capillaries than in REG gamma(+/+) littermates. Taken together, our study identifies REG gamma as a novel angiogenic factor that plays an important role in VEGF-induced expression of VCAM-1 and E-Selectin by antagonizing PICA signaling. Identification of the REG gamma-PKA-FoxO1 pathway in endothelial cells (ECs) provides another potential target for therapeutic intervention in vascular diseases. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

One of the typical pollutants, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), is commonly found in farmland in Taizhou, a major hotspot of e-waste recycling in China. This study investigated the amount of PCB residue in local farmlands. Biotransformation of PCBs was further studied under different water management conditions in paddy field with or without rice cultivation, with a special focus on the alternating flooded and drying processes. It was found that paddy field improved the attenuation of PCBs, especially for highly chlorinated congeners. In the microcosm experiment, 40% or more of the initial total PCBs was removed after sequential flood-drying treatments, compared to less than 10% in the sterilized control and 20% in the constant-drying system. Variation in the quantity of PCBs degrading and dechlorinating bacterial groups were closely related to the alteration of anaerobic-aerobic conditions. These results suggested that alternating anoxic-oxic environment in paddy field led to the sequential aerobic-anaerobic transformation of PCBs, which provided a favorable environment for natural PCB attenuation.

However, routine approach employs an arbitrary frequency band of 0.01-0.08 Hz, which lacks frequency specificity and blinds to the information contained in other frequency bands. This study investigated the amplitude of fluctuations in full BOLD frequency bands, and addressed how amplitudes of fluctuations change in each specific frequency range in idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE). Methods: Thirty-four IGE patients with generalized tonic clonic seizure and the same number of age- and sex-matched healthy controls were included. Functional MRI data were acquired using a 2 s repetition time. Routine amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation analysis was first performed. The regions showing group difference were set as Region-of-interest for analysis of amplitudes of full-frequency. The amplitudes of BOLD fluctuations were consecutively performed at each frequency bin of 0.002 Hz, and specific frequency amplitude analyses were performed in five different frequency ranges (0-0.01 Hz, 0.01-0.027 Hz, 0.027-0.073 Hz, 0.073-0.198 Hz, and 0.198-0.25 Hz). Key findings: The thalamus and prefrontal cortex showed significant group differences in routine amplitude analysis. For amplitude of full-frequency analysis, a reverse pattern was found in the dynamic changes between the thalamus and prefrontal cortex in IGE. Moreover, the prefrontal cortex showed amplitude difference in the 0.01-0.027 Hz band, while the thalamus showed amplitude difference in the 0.027-0.073 Hz band. Both these two regions showed amplitude differences in 0.198-0.25 Hz band. Significance: We demonstrated the characteristic alterations of amplitude of BOLD fluctuations in IGE in frequency domain. The amplitude analysis of full frequency may potentially help to select specific frequency range for detecting epilepsy-related brain activity, and provide insights into the pathophysiological mechanism of IGE.

The suppression of Curie temperature by Sr doping in diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor (La1-xSrx) (Zn1-yMny) AsO	EPL			English	Article							SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; PN	(La1-xSrx) (Zn1-yMny) AsO is a two-dimensional diluted ferromagnetic semiconductor that has the advantage of decoupled charge and spin doping. The substitution of Sr2+ for La3+ and Mn2+ for Zn2+ into the parent semiconductor LaZnAsO introduces hole carriers and spins, respectively. This advantage enables us to investigate the influence of carrier doping on the ferromagnetic ordered state through the control of Sr concentrations in (La1-xSrx) (Zn0.9Mn0.1) AsO. 10% Sr doping results in a ferromagnetic ordering below T-C similar to 30 K. Increasing Sr concentration up to 30% heavily suppresses the Curie temperature and saturation moments. Neutron scattering measurements indicate that no structural transition occurs for (La0.9Sr0.1) (Zn0.9Mn0.1) AsO below 300 K.

They confer upon bacteria the increasing fitness, but their evolutionary histories remain unclear. In this work, we performed a genome-wide identification of Opp systems in staphylococcal species. Novel Opp systems were identified, including the duplicate of Opp4 in Staphylococcus pseudintermedius and the ACME-Opp-like systems in coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all of the identified Opp systems were derived from Opp3 system by operon duplication during species divergence, while lateral gene transfer might also confer to the dissemination of Opp in staphylococci. In addition, we proposed an improved theory on evolution of ACME: the Opp and arginine-deiminase systems were firstly transferred from Staphylococcus haemolyticus to Staphylococcus epidermidis independently; in S. epidermidis they were assembled together and then transferred to Staphylococcus aureus.

A novel finding suggested that daphnetin might have a neuroprotective effect in stressed mice, leading us to explore its role in the microglial inflammatory response, as well as its underlying mechanism of action. We found that the production of pro-inflammatory mediators, including interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or beta-amyloid (A beta) was significantly suppressed by daphnetin in a dose-dependent manner in BV2 microglia. Also, daphnetin inhibited LPS-induced nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression and NO formation by microglia. Mechanistically, daphnetin blunted the transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappa B), which was associated with the down-regulation of the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of RelA/p65. Inhibitors of kappa B (I kappa B) phosphorylation and degradation were also affected by daphnetin, which was likely due to the reduced activation of I kappa B kinase (IKK). Additionally, LPS-induced activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (INK) and p38 MAPK, were, to a varying extent, altered by daphnetin. Finally, daphnetin blocked phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling in LPS-activated microglia, which appeared to at least partially account for the reduction in NF-kappa B transcriptional activity. Thus, daphnetin inhibited microglial activation and proinflammatory responses by modulating a series of intracellular signaling pathways, including IKK/I kappa B, MAPKs and PI-3K/Akt.

A series of plasmonic and metamaterial structures can work as efficient narrowband absorbers due to the excitation of plasmonic or photonic resonances, providing a great potential for applications in designing selective thermal emitters, biosensing, etc. In other applications such as solar-energy harvesting and photonic detection, the bandwidth of light absorbers is required to be quite broad. Under such a background, a variety of mechanisms of broadband/multiband absorption have been proposed, such as mixing multiple resonances together, exciting phase resonances, slowing down light by anisotropic metamaterials, employing high loss materials and so on.

MooDs SCZ Consortium	Convergent lines of evidence support CAMKK2 as a schizophrenia susceptibility gene	MOLECULAR PSYCHIATRY			English	Article						association; CAMKK2; eQTL; expression; protein-protein interaction; schizophrenia	GENOME-WIDE ASSOCIATION; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL GENOMICS; BIPOLAR DISORDER; COMMON VARIANTS; CONFERRING RISK; CANDIDATE GENES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MOLECULAR-CLONING; CELL-DEVELOPMENT	Genes that are differentially expressed between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls may have key roles in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. We analyzed two large-scale genome-wide expression studies, which examined changes in gene expression in schizophrenia patients and their matched controls. We found calcium/calmodulin (CAM)-dependent protein kinase kinase 2 (CAMKK2) is significantly downregulated in individuals with schizophrenia in both studies. To seek the potential genetic variants that may regulate the expression of CAMKK2, we investigated the association between single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within CAMKK2 and the expression level of CAMKK2. We found one SNP, rs1063843, which is located in intron 17 of CAMKK2, is strongly associated with the expression level of CAMKK2 in human brains (P = 1.1 x 10(-6)) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (the lowest P = 8.4 x 10(-6)). We further investigated the association between rs1063843 and schizophrenia in multiple independent populations (a total of 130 623 subjects) and found rs1063843 is significantly associated with schizophrenia (P = 5.17 x 10(-5)). Interestingly, we found the T allele of rs1063843, which is associated with lower expression level of CAMKK2, has a higher frequency in individuals with schizophrenia in all of the tested samples, suggesting rs1063843 may be a causal variant. We also found that rs1063843 is associated with cognitive function and personality in humans. In addition, protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis revealed that CAMKK2 participates in a highly interconnected PPI network formed by top schizophrenia genes, which further supports the potential role of CAMKK2 in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Taken together, these converging lines of evidence strongly suggest that CAMKK2 may have pivotal roles in schizophrenia susceptibility.

Acid rain (AR), a serious environmental issue worldwide, leaches away Ca from surrounding soils and affects vegetation. The objective of this study was to investigate how different Ca levels affect protein and RNA expression of calcium-related genes under AR stress. Pinus massoniana seedlings grown at high, medium, and low Ca levels under AR stress were used for proteomics analysis. Furthermore, relative mRNA levels of eight Ca-related genes and their interaction network were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and bioinformatic analysis. Proteomic studies identified 95 differentially expressed proteins which were classified into eight groups, including metabolic processes, photosynthesis, and cell rescue and defense, etc. Moreover, qRT-PCR results indicated that low Ca significantly increased the expression level of the investigated Ca-related genes, which can be reversed by high Ca under AR stress. Defense system, gene transcription and translation, photosynthetic machinery, and substance and energy metabolism may play important roles in the responses of P. massoniana to AR stress. Low Ca increases the abundance of cell rescue and defense-related proteins under AR. High Ca can reduce AR damage by increasing the abundance of proteins involved in the Calvin cycle, glycolysis, TCA cycle, and nitrogen metabolism. Our results indicated a possible mechanism involving Ca in AR tolerance in plants.

Whereas these luminogens are weakly fluorescent in solutions, they are highly emissive in the aggregated state, with high fluorescence quantum yields up to 99% in solid films, demonstrating aggregation-induced emission characteristics. Reversible piezochromic luminescence is observed from the solids of the luminogens. A notable emission color change from blue (445 nm) to green (503 nm) is readily realized by grinding the pristine powder of the luminogen. The blue emission is recovered by fuming the ground powder with dichloromethane vapor. The undoped electroluminescence devices using the luminogens as light-emitting layers are fabricated, affording high current efficiencies up to 7.2 cd/A. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared samples were systematically characterized by X-ray diffraction, N-2 adsorption-desorption, X-ray photoelectron spectra, transmission electron microscopy and UV-visible diffuse reflectance spectroscopy. The characterizations indicated all the samples had mesoporous structure and narrow pore size distribution. Pr3+ doping enlarged the surface area and decreased the crystallite size. The surface area of the samples varied from 136 to 170 m(2)/g, and the average crystallite size ranged between 5.04 and 7.60 nm. The effect of Pr3+ doping amount on the photocatalytic activity of mesoporous TiO2 was evaluated by the degradation of methyl orange under UV light irradiation. The results showed that the suitable amount of Pr3+ doped samples exhibited the higher photocatalytic activity than mesoporous TiO2.
