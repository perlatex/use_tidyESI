The rhombohedral and tetragonal phases co-exist in the ceramics with x = 0-0.036 and the concentration of Er3+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure. The partial substitution of Er3+ for Bi3+ improves the piezoelectricity of the ceramic. The ceramics with x = 0-0.02 possess strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 26.7-29.6 mu C/cm(2)) and good piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 146-181 pC/N, k(p)= 21.2-34.1%, respectively). After the addition of Er3+, the ceramics exhibit the characteristic up/down-conversion emission of Er3+ ions. The ceramic with x = 0.032 possesses the strongest emissions at approximately 535 nm and 549 nm, which are attributed to H-2(11/2) -> I-4(15/2) and S-4(3/2) -> I-4(15/2) transitions, respectively. The ceramics with low Er2O3 levels exhibit simultaneously strong piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity and photoluminescence and thus may have a potential application in multifunctional devices.

Herein we report the synthesis of Ru nanoparticles supported on nanodiamond by a one-step approach through the reduction of RuCl3 using AB as reducing agent. The nanocomposites surfaces with large quantity of oxygen containing functional groups such as hydroxyl and carboxylic groups resulted in a homogeneous suspension in aqueous phase. The catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond was studied for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis at 25 degrees C. Results indicated that nanodiamond supported Ru nanoparticles with a mean particle size of 3.7 nm exhibited high catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency number of 229 mol H-2 center dot(mol Ru center dot min)(-1). The high catalytic activity of Ru/nanodiamond demonstrates that nano diamond is a good media for nanoparticles immobilization. Copyright (c) 2015, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

In this QSS scheme, each agent can obtain a shadow of the secret key by performing single-particle measurements.

Based on the Wigner distribution function, the analytical expressions for the skewness parameter A and the kurtosis parameter K of PCDA beams are derived. The analytical expression for the oceanic turbulence parameter T' related to K is also derived, and characteristics of T' are examined. It is found that the behaviors of A and K in oceanic turbulence are quite different from those in free space. In free space, the mass of the intensity distribution may move from one side of the centroid position axis y(c) to another side at a certain propagation distance z(0), and z(0) is independent of the correlation parameter tau. The mass of the intensity distribution is concentrated on one side of y(c) on propagation only for a poorly coherent beam in free space, but it is always this situation for different value of tau when oceanic turbulence is not weak. In free space, it takes a leptokurtic profile in the far field, and a Gaussian profile appears only for a poorly coherent beam. However, in oceanic turbulence it always reaches a Gaussian profile for different value of r in the far field. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The energy gaps and the conductance for ASiNRs can be effectively modulated by effective spin-orbit coupling lambda(SO) and the potential energy V-0. With increasing lambda(SO), the energy gap for 6-ASiNR and 7-ASiNR decreases, while it remains zero for metallic 8-ASiNR. Interestingly, an energy gap appears for 8-ASiNR in presence of V-0, which results in the appearance of a conductance gap for 8-ASiNR system. Additionally, the dependence of conductance on Anderson disorder strength has been studied. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of them lack comprehensive biological data. In this study, the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Sorex bedfordiae was determined. The mitogenome is 17 160 base pairs in length and contains 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes, and one control region. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of Sorex bedfordiae and other 10 species in Soricidae were used for phylogenetic analyses. Tree constructed using Bayesian phylogenetic methods demonstrated Sorex bedfordiae as a sister to Sorex cylindricauda. Phylogenetic analyses further confirmed that Blarinella diverged prior to Sorex and Anourosorex, but Episoriculus differentiated earlier than Neomys and Nectogale within subfamily Soricinae.

Lam.] is one of the top six most important crops in the world in terms of production. It has the capacity to tolerate marginal growing conditions better than most other crops. In this study, a proline-and glycine-rich protein encoding gene, IbPGAHRP1, was isolated and characterized from the transcriptome of sweet potato cultivar Xushu 18. Sequence analyses showed that proline, glycine, alanine, and histidine account for 62.6% of the total amino acid residues. Two proline-rich tandem repeats, an alanine-rich repeat, a histidine-rich tandem repeat, and five XYPP motifs were present in IbPGAHRP1. Sequence similarity analysis showed that IbPGAHRP1 shared 41% similarity with GmGPRP4, indicating that IbPGAHRP1 should be a GPRP-like protein and play an important role in stress resistance. RT-PCR results showed that IbPGAHRP1 was specifically expressed in the sweet potato flower. In vivo expression of IbPGAHRP1 demonstrated that it enhanced the cold and drought resistance in the yeast recombinant, but could not trigger the same changes in Escherichia coli. This study revealed that IbPGAHRP1 is a flower-specific gene and should play an important role in response to abiotic stresses.

The unique 3D network structures of the aerogels enable a remarkable reduction in their thermal conductivities. It is shown that the CNT-Ag nanocomposite aerogels (CNTANAs) possess low thermal conductivities of only 0.06 to 0.095 W m(-1) k(-1) with various Ag contents at room temperature; these values are much lower than those of other reported CNT and Ag composites with non-porous structures. Moreover, the electrical conductivities and Seebeck coefficients of the CNTANAs can be simultaneously enhanced by increasing the Ag content in the unique structure; this overcomes a drawback of bulk semiconductors wherein increasing electrical conductivity is generally accompanied by a reduced Seebeck coefficient and enhances the thermal conductivity. As a result, this strategy results in a maximum ZT value of 0.011. This ZT value is about 1 order of magnitude higher than that of the carbon aerogel and 2 orders of magnitude higher than that of the silver/polymer composites and CNT/polymer composites. At the same time, the fragile solid skeleton and highly opencell foam structure of the CNTANAs lead to low apparent density (similar to 130 kg m(-3)). In this study, our study offers a new preparation method for TE materials, which will broaden the development of this facile and novel category of lightweight TE material.

Complexes 1-4 crystallized in the triclinic space group C2/c, P2(1)/n, P-1 and C2/c, respectively. In 1 and 4, Ag+ is four-coordinate with L-1 or L-4 to form 1-D {[Ag(L-1/L-4)(2)](+)} polymeric cations. In 2, Ag+ is three-coordinate by two L-2 ligands and one NO3- ligand to form a 1-D {[Ag(L-2)(NO3)]} zigzag chain. In 3, Ag+ is four-coordinate by L-3 to form a dinuclear [Ag(L-3)(3)](+) cation. The NO3- is a 4-connector bridging group in 1 and 3 and a 5-connector bridging group in 2 and 4. The intermolecular hydrogen bonds and AgO weak interactions play important roles in forming 3-D networks of 1-4. The antibacterial activities for 1-4 were evaluated against Bacillussubtilis, Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli with MTT method. The antibacterial results indicated that 2 showed the best inhibitory activity against the test bacterial strains, and was as potent as chloramphenicol. [GRAPHICS] .

The beam spreading of truncated laser beams is less affected by thermal blooming than that of untruncated ones. There exists the oscillatory behavior of beam width versus the truncated parameter due to thermal blooming. When there exists the cross wind, under steady-state thermal blooming, the astigmatism of truncated laser beams is better than that of untruncated ones, and the centriod position is furthest away from the propagation axis for a certain value of the truncated parameter.

Applying the Fisher score to identify Alzheimer's disease-related genes	GENETICS AND MOLECULAR RESEARCH			English	Article						Alzheimer's disease; Fisher score; Feature selection; Gene microarray	CANCER CLASSIFICATION; MICROARRAY; EXPRESSION	Biologists and scientists can use the data from Alzheimer's disease (AD) gene expression microarrays to mine AD disease-related genes. Because of disadvantages such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and a high level of noise, it is difficult to obtain accurate and meaningful biological information from gene expression profiles. In this paper, we present a novel approach for utilizing AD microarray data to identify the morbigenous genes. The Fisher score, a classical feature selection method, is utilized to evaluate the importance of each gene. Genes with a large between-classes variance and small within-class variance are selected as candidate morbigenous genes. The results using an AD dataset show that the proposed approach is effective for gene selection. Satisfactory accuracy can be achieved by using only a small number of selected genes.

The rationality of the transition state can be proved by vibration frequency analysis and IRC computations. Moreover, atoms-in-molecules (AIM) theory and natural bond orbital (NBO) theory were applied for discussing the interaction among orbitals and the bonding characteristics. The calculating results indicate that Pt-6 clusters are favored for catalyzing the activation and hydrogenation of the C=O bond in cinnamaldehyde molecules, eventually producing cinnamyl alcohol, which proved that Pt-6 clusters have a strong reaction selectivity for catalyzing the hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde. Compared with Co-doped Pt clusters, Pt-6 clusters are more likely to catalyze the activation and hydrogenation of the C=O bond. Using Co-doped Pt clusters to catalyze the selective hydrogenation reaction of cinnamaldehyde to produce cinnamyl alcohol, the activation energy is lower than that of the reaction catalyzed by pure Pt clusters. The doped catalyst has a synergetic catalytic effect. Our findings have explained the mechanism of action of the doped catalyst and the experimental phenomena.

JOURNAL OF INTEGRATIVE AGRICULTURE			English	Article						QTL; appearance quality; 1000-grain weight; recombination inbred lines (RIL); rice	MARKER-ASSISTED SELECTION; LINE POPULATION; MAJOR QTL; CHALKINESS; WIDTH; SHAPE; SIZE; ENCODES; LENGTH; YIELD	Grain appearance quality traits, measured as grain length (GL), grain width (GW), length to width ratio (LWR), grain thickness (GT) and the percentage of grain with chalkiness (PGWC), as well as 1000-grain weight (TGW), are very important factors that contribute to rice grain quality and yield. To detect quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting these traits, we developed a set of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from Gang46B (G46B) and K1075, a G46B introgression line with lower PGWC. Based on a linkage map containing 33 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers, a total of 15 additive QTLs governing six measured traits were identified on 4 chromosomes across two environments. Of these, the five major QTLs which controlled GW, LWR, GT, PGWC, and TGW, each explaining up to 44.30, 55.29, 62.30, 30.94, and 28.78% of the variation, respectively, were found in the same interval of RM18004-RM18068 on chromosome 5. The G46B alleles contributed to the increase in GW, GT and PGWC at all loci, as well as the increase in TGW at its major QTL locus. Significant interactions between additive QTL and the environment were found at most loci, in which the largest, accounting for 15.06% of variation, was observed between gPGWC-5 and the environment. A total of 15 epistasis QTLs were detected for all the traits, and GL, GW and PGWC had significant epistasis QTLs based on environment interactions with minor effects. These results are valuable for future map-based cloning of the QTLs and the collaborative improvement of G46B in grain appearance quality and yield.

Here, we reported a facile method to prepare poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF) composites with nano-carbon fillers including zero-dimensional superfullerene (SF), one-dimensional carbon nanotubes (CNT) and two-dimensional graphene sheets (GS) by simple solution blending and compression molding. The effects of these nano-carbon fillers on the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites were systematically investigated. It was found that PVDF composites exhibit a higher thermal conductivity than that of neat PVDF. Among them, the thermal conductivity of PVDF composites with 20 wt% two-dimensional GS reaches a maximum (2.06 W m(-1) K-1), which is approximately 10-fold enhancement in comparison to that of the neat PVDF. Such highly thermal conductive PVDF composites may enable some prospective applications in advanced thermal management.

To investigate the impact of beta-catenin expression on survival outcomes and clinicopathological features in sarcoma patients, a meta-analysis was conducted. Comprehensive literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library for relevant studies. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and relative risk (RR) were calculated to assess the correlations of beta-catenin expression with survival outcomes and clinicopathological features. In total, 14 studies with 1036 sarcoma patients were identified. Beta-catenin expression was found to be significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR=2.11, 95% CI: 1.65-2.69/P<0.001). Further, when the analysis was stratified by histological subtype (bone sarcoma including osteosarcoma and chondrosarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma including synovial sarcoma), subcellular staining position (nuclear staining and nuclear/cytoplasmic staining), and statistical analysis (multivariate analysis and univariate analysis), the significant correlation to poor survival was also observed except in chondrosarcoma group. For clinicopathological features, beta-catenin expression was significantly associated with higher rate of metastasis (RR=1.74, 95% CI=1.35-2.25; P<0.001) and local recurrence (RR=2.84, 95% CI=1.17-6.87; P=0.021), higher tumor grade (RR=1.38, 95% CI=1.02-1.86; P=0.039) and higher stage at diagnosis (RR=1.45, 95% CI=1.14-1.85; P=0.003), but not associated with tumor site and tumor size. In conclusion, beta-catenin expression may be an effective prognostic factor of poor survival and clinicopathological features in patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma. Future studies are needed to validate our findings.

The total length of the N. fulvescens mitogenome is 16 296 bp and contains 13 protein-coding genes, 2 ribosomal RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and a control region, with a base composition of 34.3%A, 29.1%T, 24.2%C and 12.4%G. The nucleotide sequence data of 12 heavy-strand protein-coding genes of N. fulvescens and other 18 rodents were used for mitochondrial genome phylogenetic analyses. Bayesian phylogenetic tree demonstrated the genus Niviventer was embedded within the genus Leopoldamys, although three Niviventer species constituted a monophyletic group. More complete mitochondrial genome sequences are required to illuminate the molecular phylogenetic relationship between Niviventer and Leopoldamys.

Compared with the previously integrating ones, it can be seen that the two results are in agreement with each other exactly for the collimated and focused beam, respectively. Further, the influences of three main oceanic parameters (i.e., the rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature xi., the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of seawater a and the ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum w) and the beam radius W-0 on beam wander are investigated in the collimated and focused beam cases. The results indicate that the beam wander increases as a decreases, chi(T) increases, salinity-induced predominates and W-0 decreases in mentioned above cases. In addition, based on the dimensionless quantity Bw, the relation between beam wander and the long-term spot size or turbulence-induced beam spot size is investigated. In particular, to distinguish beam wander among different beam types, the relative beam wander is defined. Based on this definition, the increment of beam wander between focused and collimated beam is larger than that of arbitrary beam type (i.e., 0 <Theta(0)< 1). It is beneficial to select the predominant beam type in laser propagation applications (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier GmbH.

An R-module M is said to be super finitely presented if there is an exact sequence of R-modules ... -> P-n -> ... -> P-1 -> P-0 -> M -> 0, where each P-i is finitely generated projective. In this article, it is shown that if R has the property (B) that every super finitely presented module has finite Gorenstein projective dimension, then every finitely generated Gorenstein projective module is super finitely presented. As an application of the notion of super finitely presented modules, we show that if R has the property (C) that every super finitely presented module has finite projective dimension, then R is K-0-regular, i.e., K-0(R[x(1), ... , x(n)]) congruent to K-0(R) for all n >= 1.

The considered system consists of a Source-Destination (S-D) pair and a relay node (R). R adopts conditional DF relaying scheme to decide whether to aid S-D pair's information transmission or not, under which R employs the signal-to-noise ratio of S-D link as an indication of the need of the cooperation aid. The outage performance has been investigated over Nakagami-m fading channels for integer values of m, as well as the symbol error performance of multiple phase shift keying and multiple quadrature amplitude modulations. The closed-form analytical expressions for outage probability and average symbol error rate have been derived and verified by Monte-Carlo simulations. Simulation and numerical results match very well with each other, which indicates that our proposed analytical models can well predict the outage and symbol error performance of the target conditional DF relaying schemes over Nakagami-m fading channels.

The results from ultraviolet spectroscopic method indicated that VK3 and -CD formed 1:1 inclusion complex, with the inclusion constant K-f = 1.02 x 10(4) L/mol, which is based on Benesi-Hildebrand's viewpoint. The outcomes from the probe method and Scatchard methods suggested that the interaction mode between -CD-K-3 and DNA was a mixture mode, which included intercalation and electrostatic binding effects. The binding constants were K-25 degrees C = 2.16 x 10(4) L/mol, and K-37 degrees C = 1.06 x 10(4) L/mol. The thermodynamic functions of the interaction between -CD-K-3 and DNA were H-r(m) = -2.74 x 10(4) J/mol, S-r(m) = 174.74 Jmol(-1)K(-1), therefore, both H-r(m) (enthalpy) and S-r(m) (entropy) worked as driven forces in this action.

The partial substitution of (Li0.5Dy0.5)(2+) for Ca2+ ions in CaBi4Ti4O15 leads to great multi-improvement in the ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity, luminescence and thermal stability of the materials. All the ceramics possess a bismuth-layer structure; and the crystal structure of the ceramics is transformed from four layer bismuth-layer structure to a three layer structure with x increasing. For the ceramic with x = 0.2, high resistivity (R = 3.0 x 10(11) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 10.5 pC N-1), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 9.92 mu C cm(-2)) and improved luminescence are simultaneously obtained. These enhancements in multifunctional properties are greatly attributed to the contribution of (Li0.5Dy0.5)(2+) in the ceramics. Under the excitation of 451 nm light, the (LiDy)(2+)- modified ceramics exhibit bright blue and yellow emission peaks centered at 484 nm and 574 nm, corresponding to the transition of the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) levels of Dy3+ ions, respectively.

The fluorescence properties of the DNA-AgNCs are related to the modified position of the DNA. When biotin is linked to the middle thymine base of the DNA sequence, the DNA-AgNCs emit the strongest fluorescence. Moreover, the stability of the DNA-AgNCs was affected by avidin through biotin-avidin binding, quenching the fluorescence of the DNA-AgNCs. In contrast, if free biotin is further introduced into this system, the quenching is apparently weakened by competition, leading to the restoration of fluorescence. This phenomenon can be utilized for the detection of biotin. Under the optimal conditions, the fluorescence recovery is linearly proportional to the concentration of biotin in the range of 10 nM-1.0 mu M with a detection limit of 6.0 nM. This DNA-AgNCs probe with excellent fluorescent properties is sensitive and selective for the detection of biotin and has been applied for the determination of biotin in wheat flour.

Squeezing of output field in a two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system with a nonlinear medium	OPTIK			English	Article						Squeezing spectrum; Two-mechanical-mode optomechanical system; Kerr-down-conversion nonlinear crystal	QUANTUM; MECHANICS; LIMITS	We consider the squeezing of output field in a two-mechanical-mode optomechanical cavity, which contains a Kerr-down conversion nonlinear crystal. It is found that the squeezing magnitude of the output field is enhanced by injection of the optical parametric amplifier (OPA) and the Kerr medium, and the squeezing region is shifted with the Kerr parameter. When the frequencies of the two movable mirrors are set by different values, the sharp peak with high contrast due to excess noise from thermally occupied mechanical mode will be split into two parts, which are located at the frequencies of the movable mirrors. This can be applied to high precision measurement of the frequencies of the mechanical oscillators. Finally, we consider the influence of the environment temperature on the squeezing spectrum. This is helpful in generating controllable squeezing in the optomechanical system by using nonlinear media. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.	[Li, J. H.; Hou, B.

All of the reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products were optimized with the B3LYP method at 6-31+G(d) basis set. The single-point energy and zero-point energy correction were calculated for the optimized configuration of each compound with the sane method at 6-311++G(d,p) basis set. Transition states have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate. In addition, nature bond orbital and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. The results showed that the activation energy of the rate-determining step in the absence of catalysts was 250.63 kJ.mol(-1), which were 74.01 and 131.68 kJ.mol(-1) via Cu2O and CuI catalyzed, respectively. Results indicated that catalyst Cu2O promotes reaction effectively. All calculations were consistent with experiments. (C) 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Effects of TRiEGME on water icing behavior in aviation turbine fuel	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						icing inhibitor; icing behavior; low temperature; partition coefficient		The high vapor pressure of diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, the only approved civil aviation fuel system icing inhibitor (FSII), causes the peeling of fuel tank topcoat material. This leads to increased maintenance costs and decreased aircraft mission capabilities. Triethylene glycol monomethyl ether (TriEGME) has been proposed as a potential replacement as it has a low vapor pressure and can partition into any free water in the fuel forming a solution with a low freezing point. However, its use has not been approved by airworthiness authority because very few data are available for its impacts on water solubility and icing behavior in fuel. The effects of TriEGME on water solubility, solidification temperature, and water icing behavior in fuel were thoroughly studied. At added concentration ranging from 0.10 to 0.15 vol. % water solubility in jet fuel almost tripled compared with that without FSII. The solidification temperatures for water in fuel with FSII and for mixture of water and FSII decreased with increased FSII concentration. Moreover, partition coefficient, defined as equilibrium FSII concentration in aqueous phase divided by equilibrium FSII concentration in fuel phase, decreased with increased FSII concentration in fuel. At equilibrium condition with fixed FSII concentration in fuel, decrease in fuel temperature led to an increase in partition coefficient. An estimation of required dosage for TriEGME to prevent water icing in fuel can be achieved by comparison of TriEGME concentration in aqueous phase with its corresponding freezing temperature.

In order to maintain high antiknock performance of avgas, an advanced adsorption method was developed using 5A zeolite to remove linear and monobranched alkane from avgas for octane number enhancement. An experimental study of single, binary, and quaternary adsorption of octane isomers on a fixed bed reactor was performed in this work. The effects of partial pressure, operating temperature, and initial mixture composition on breakthrough curves and sorption selectivity were thoroughly studied. At fixed partial pressure, normal octane was the strongest-adsorbed component, followed by 2-methylheptane, 2, 5-dimethylhexane, and 2, 2, 4-trimethylpentane. Adsorption capacity of all components increased with increased partial pressure and decreased with increased operating temperature. However, for all binary mixtures studied in this work, the sorption selectivity decreased as total pressure increased. At equimolar concentrations the normal and monobranched isomers were preferentially adsorbed, while when the volume percentages of the isomers were different, the adsorption of the isomer with the higher volume ratio was favoured. The quaternary breakthrough curves for octane isomers at 473 K with each component having partial pressure of 0.15 kPa also indicated the feasibility of simultaneous removal of normal and monobranched isomers from a multiple-component mixture by this 5A zeolite.

Many gradient dependent energy functions, such as Potts model and total variation denoising, regard image as piecewise constant function. In these methods, some important information such as edge sharpness and location is well preserved, but some detailed image feature like texture is often compromised in the process of denoising. For this reason, an image denoising method based on local adaptive regularization is proposed in this paper, which can adaptively adjust denoising degree of noisy image by adding spatial variable fidelity term, so as to better preserve fine scale features of image. Experimental results show that the proposed denoising method can achieve state-of-the-art subjective visual effect, and the signal-noise-ratio (SNR) is also objectively improved by 0.3-0.6 dB.

The effects of sintering temperature (T-s) and dwell time (t(s)) on the ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and fluorescence of the ceramics were studied. Furthermore, the influence of poling electrical field on the up-conversion emission intensities was also discussed. As T-s and t(s) increase, the grains grow larger gradually and evolve from spheroid to rectangular shape. By increasing T-s and t(s), the ferroelectricity of the ceramics is improved and the remnant polarization P-r increases. The optimum sintering temperature and dwell time for the piezoelectricity of ceramics are 1200 degrees C and 2 h, respectively. Also, both of the sintering temperature and dwell time make an important influence on the fluorescence of the ceramics. The ceramics sintered at 1140-1160 degrees C for 2 h possess excellent up/down-conversion fluorescence. The up-conversion emission intensity of the ceramics is further enhanced by optimizing poling electric field. This work develops a kind of multifunctional material that simultaneously possesses good ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity and excellent up/down-conversion fluorescence by optimizing sintering temperature and dwell time.

With the theoretical calculation method is more reasonable and calculation accuracy continues to improve, Theoretical calculate advantage is more obvious in the infrared spectrum simulation and vibration modes attributable identified. And it has important reference value for experimental study of infrared spectral analysis. Using density functional theory, geometry optimizations and frequencies calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were performed at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p), the stable structure and all vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin were attained. The results show that the infrared absorption peak of 7-hydroxycoumarin is mainly distributed in the several regions in wave number of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000, 1 750 similar to 1 400, 1 400 similar to 1 000, 1 000 similar to 50 cm(-1). In addition to the vibration in a wave number range of 3 700 similar to 3 500, 3 150 similar to 3 000 cm(-1) is relatively independent, and were attributed to OH stretching vibration and benzene ring CH stretching vibration, the other several vibration regions are more complex, the different degree of spectral peaks is composed of multiple vibration modes. Finally, based on the theoretical analysis of the vibration mode, the vibration modes of 7-Hydroxycoumarin molecule were assigned, and in order to discuss the reliability of theoretical calculation method, the correlation diagram of the main absorption peak of 7-hydroxyl group was drawn from the theoretical value of X axis and the experimental value of Y axis, the correlation between experimental IR data and calculated IR data of 7-Hydroxycoumarin was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, correlation coefficient values "r" equals 0. 998 5, and the theory calculation of 7-Hydroxycoumarin IR by density functional theory at the base set level is reliable.

The effects of SmCoO3 on phase structure, piezoelectricity and multiferroicity of the ceramics were studied. All the ceramics can be well sintered at a low sintering temperature of 960A degrees C. The crystalline structure of the ceramics is transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal symmetry with increasing the amount of SmCoO3. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x = 0.01-0.04. A small amount of SmCoO3 is shown to improve the ferroelectric, piezoelectric and magnetoelectric properties of the ceramics. For the ceramics with x = 0.01-0.03, enhanced resistivity (R 1.2 x 10(9) Omega cm to 2.1 x 10(9) Omega cm), piezoelectricity (d (33) 65 pC/N to 106 pC/N) and ferroelectricity (P (r) 6.38 mu C/cm(2) to 22.89 mu C/cm(2)) are obtained. The ferromagnetism of the materials is greatly enhanced by the doping of SmCoO3 such that a very high magnetoelectric coefficient of 742 mV/(cm Oe) is obtained at x = 0.01, suggesting a promising potential in multiferroic devices.

To wind the three-phase noninductive bifilar pancake coils, 324-m SuperPower SF12100-type ReBCO tapes are adopted, whereas one Cryomech AL600-type Gifford-McMahon refrigerator is used to form a liquid nitrogen (LN2) circulated cooling system. Two main ac loss contributions of the hysteresis loss and the flux flow loss are calculated and discussed to achieve accurate SFCL resistance modeling. Finally, case studies with regard to a 1.5-MW DFIG-based wind turbine system are carried out to verify the feasibility of the proposedSFCL-basedFRTscheme. With the designed SFCL, the fault rotor current is significantly reduced from about 4396 (4.94 p.u.) to 1406 A (1.58 p.u.) during the most severe condition. The fault grid voltage is also improved from about 89.7 (0.13 p.u.) to 103.5 V (0.15 p.u.) to comply with the international grid codes. In addition, the equivalent SFCL resistance and its corresponding ac loss contributions are discussed to evaluate the integrated performance of the designed SFCL during a grid fault.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Double-quantitative fusion of accuracy and importance: Systematic measure mining, benign integration construction, hierarchical attribute reduction	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Attribute reduction; Uncertainty measure; Double quantification	THEORETIC ROUGH SETS; 3-WAY DECISIONS; UNCERTAINTY MEASURES; SHADOWED SETS; FUZZY; MODEL; PRECISION; GRANULATION; APPROXIMATIONS; ENTROPY	Uncertainty measure mining and applications are fundamental, and it is possible for double-quantitative fusion to acquire benign measures via heterogeneity and complementarity. This paper investigates the double-quantitative fusion of relative accuracy and absolute importance to provide systematic measure mining, benign integration construction, and hierarchical attribute reduction. (1) First, three-way probabilities and measures are analyzed. Thus, the accuracy and importance are systematically extracted, and both are further fused into importance-accuracy (IP-Accuracy), a synthetic causality measure. (2) By sum integration, IP-Accuracy gains a bottom-top granulation construction and granular hierarchical structure. IP-Accuracy holds benign granulation monotonicity at both the knowledge concept and classification levels. (3) IP-Accuracy attribute reduction is explored based on decision tables. A hierarchical reduct system is thereby established, including qualitative/quantitative reducts, tolerant/approximate reducts, reduct hierarchies, and heuristic algorithms. Herein, the innovative tolerant and approximate reducts quantitatively approach/expand/weaken the ideal qualitative reduct. (4) Finally, a decision table example is provided for illustration. This paper performs double-quantitative fusion of causality measures to systematically mine IP-Accuracy, and this measure benignly constructs a granular computing platform and hierarchical reduct system. By resorting to a monotonous uncertainty measure, this study provides an integration-evolution strategy of granular construction for attribute reduction. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that ZnGeP2 has an indirect band gap of 1.222 eV. The covalent character of the bonds in ZnGeP2 crystal is verified by Mulliken population. By analyzing the optical properties including the dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, reflectivity spectrum and absorption coefficient, we indicate that ZnGeP2 is a promising mid-IR optical material, which is in good agreement with the available experimental results.

Under similar conditions, use of the related [2 + 2] oxy-bridged macrocycle [2,2'-O(C6H4N=CH)(2)-4-RC6H2OH] ((IIH2)-H-R), afforded the bimetallic complexes [(MnCl)(2)IIR] (R = Me 3, tBu 4), whilst the macrocycle derived from 1,2-diaminobenzene and 5,5'-di-tert-butyl-2,2'-di-hydroxy-3,3'-methylenedibenzaldehyde (IIIH4) afforded the complex [(MnCl)(2)(III)]center dot 2MeCN (5 center dot 2MeCN). For comparative studies, the salt complexes [2,6-(ArNHCH)(2)-4-MeC6H2O][MnCl3(NCMe)] (Ar = 2,4-Me2C6H3, 6) and {[(2-ArN=CH), 6-(ArNHCH)-4-Me-C6H2O]MnCl}(2)[MnCl4]center dot 8CH(2)Cl(2) (Ar = 4-MeC6H4, 7 center dot 8CH(2)Cl(2)) were prepared.

The as-prepared absorbents were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. Subsequently, the absorbents were utilized for the removal of Pr3+ and Nd3+ from aqueous solution. We systematically investigated the influences of pH values, initial concentration of metal on the adsorption capacity, as well as the adsorption kinetics and adsorption isotherms. The obtained experimental results suggested that among these absorbents, SiO2-BT exhibited the best performances for the removal of both Pr3+ and Nd3+ in aqueous solutions. Under the optimum conditions, the adsorptive removal efficiency could reach the adsorption equilibrium just within 60min, and the adsorption capacities of Pr3+ and Nd3+ on SiO2-BT were 329.2 and 341.5mg/g, respectively. It was found that the adsorption kinetics was well described by the pseudo-second-order kinetic model while the adsorption isotherms followed the Langmuir adsorption model.

The advantage of picture fuzzy set is easily reflecting the ambiguous nature of subjective judgments because the picture fuzzy sets are suitable for capturing imprecise, uncertain, and inconsistent information in the multiple attribute decision making analysis. Thus, the cross entropy of picture fuzzy sets, called picture fuzzy cross entropy, is proposed as an extension of the cross entropy of fuzzy sets. Then, a multiple attribute decision making method based on the proposed picture fuzzy cross entropy is established in which attribute values for alternatives are picture fuzzy numbers. In decision making process, we utilize the picture fuzzy weighted cross entropy between the ideal alternative and an alternative to rank the alternatives corresponding to the cross entropy values and to select the most desirable one(s). Finally, a practical example for enterprise resource planning system selection is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

Hysteresis loops, spin distributions and energy products have been calculated with a finite hard layer thickness t(h). Both remanence and coercivity of the multilayer system decrease as beta increases, leading to a significant decrease of the maximum energy product. A 30 deviation of the easy axis could result in a drop of the maximum energy product by more than 60%, which offers a possible explanation on the large discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical energy products. The effect of the finite hard layer thickness on the demagnetization process is important, which can only be ignored when th is large enough. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Wan, X.

In this study, the shape memory properties of poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL)-based nanocomposites with nano-crystalline cellulose (NCC) as fillers are investigated via recrystallization at a high temperature under a high-pressure environment. The sizes of spherulites of PCL, the degrees of crystallinity (X-c), and the melting temperature of the PCL-NCC nanocomposites were characterized by polarizing microscopy (POM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The results exhibit that when the mass ratio of NCC was maintained constant, both the crystal properties and melting temperatures of the nanocomposites decreased with increasing pressure. Furthermore, the shape memory fixity ratios of the recrystallized nanocomposites remained more than 90% due to the fact that the chemical cross-linking structure and the recovery ratios kept increasing with the increase in pressure. The mechanism of the improvement of the shape memory function was further analyzed, and the result demonstrates that the pressure has a significant influence on the crystal properties of PCL polymers during their recrystallization; subsequently the shape recovery ratio is improved since more molecular chains participate in the shape recovery process.

Herein, we reported a facile approach for the synthesis of platinum nanoparticle (PtNP) aqueous colloid by utilizing black wattle tannin (BWT, a typical plant polyphenol) as amphiphilic stabilizer. The phenolic hydroxyls of BWT provide the PtNPs with enough hydrophilicity, and their reduction ability could protect the PtNPs from deactivation caused by oxygen atmosphere. Additionally, the hydrophilic nature of BWT could efficiently promote the oxidation of alcohols in water, meanwhile, the hydrophobic and rigid backbones of plant polyphenols are able to suppress the PtNPs from aggregating, thus ensuring the high dispersion of the PtNPs during reactions. Under mild aerobic conditions, the as-prepared BWT-Pt colloid catalyst exhibited high activity in a series of biphasic oxidation of aromatic alcohols and aliphatic alcohols. As for the cycling stability, the BWT-Pt catalyst showed no obvious decrease during the 7 cycles, revealing superior cycling stability as compared with the counterparts using PVP or PEG as the stabilizer.

Firstly, a series of polyurethanes were successfully synthesized through solution polymerisation of polyethylene glycol (PEG, M-n = 4000 kg mol(-1)), dimethylolpropionic acid (DMPA) and 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI). These polymers were named as PEG-i-MDI-DMPA (i = 20%, 30%, 40%), and i represents the weight content of PEG in the polymers. The results of shape memory testing showed that the PEG-30%-MDI-DMPA displays both the triple-shape memory effect and the pH sensitive dual-shape memory effect. In PEG-30%-MDI-DMPA, the glass transition of PEG chains and the association and disassociation of carboxylic dimers act as two switches to control the triple-shape memory effect, while the carboxylic dimer is affected by pH values to associate in acidic solutions (at pH 2) and dissociate in alkaline solutions (at pH 9) to induce the pH-sensitive shape memory. The carboxylic dimers play an important role in the construction of shape memory properties in this polyurethane.

This material displays excellent thermo-and water-induced shape memory behavior with a recovery ratio of nearly 99%. These UPys are dimerized as DDAA arrays, which present good stability in both water and alkaline solutions (pH 12), or at temperatures below 120 degrees C. UPy dimers act as a fixed phase to hold the material's permanent shape, whereas the PVA chains act as a reversible phase to control the temporary shape. This physical cross-linking, formed by UPy dimerization, can potentially replace traditional chemical cross-linking with covalent bonds, thereby providing a more simple and practical strategy to obtain multi-responsive shape memory polymers.

The crystal structure of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 has no obvious change after the coating of 2 wt% Bi2O3. Bi2O3 is homogenously coated on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles. The Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode presents an enhanced cycling stability, better rate performance and lower charge transfer resistance. After the coating of 2 wt% Bi2O3, the initial coulombic efficiency of the material has been improved to 76.9% compared to 72.6% for the bare Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2. After 100 cycles at 0.1C, the Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode retains a discharge capacity of 182.9 mA h g(-1) with capacity retention of 73.5%, which are much higher than those of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (146.9 mA h g(-1) and 58.8%). In addition, the Bi2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 electrode exhibits better rate capability with discharge capacities of 155.8, 124.8 and 89.2 mA h g(-1) at 1, 2 and 5C, respectively, superior to that of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2. The enhanced cycling stability and rate capability should be ascribed to the existence of Bi2O3 on the surface of the active material, which can efficiently restrain the side reactions between the electrode and electrolyte, stabilize the structure of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 and improve the lithium ion diffusion.

We perform simulations of the Au-SiC-Au junction breaking process by calculating the conductance in four different anchoring geometries and obtain the equilibrium conductance and the projected density of states of junctions in the optimal position. The hollow-hollow configuration is found to be the most stable contact geometry with the largest conductance. From the calculation of restoring force and the spatial electron density differences after the structural break, we conclude that the Si-C bond is more stable than Au-C and Au-Si bonds in the single-molecular molecular junction. Moreover, the behavior of the junction currents is revealed under small bias. All junctions exhibit a linear current-voltage relationship, indicating characteristic metallic behavior at low bias voltage. The asymmetry of the I-V curves reflects the asymmetry of the molecule and the contact geometry. The origin of the transport spectrum of the junctions is discussed with the molecular projected self-consistent Hamiltonian (MPSH) states. The calculated results prove that the coupling morphology of the SiC molecule connected with electrodes, the distance and the external bias voltage have a great effect on the conductance of nanoscale junctions.

However, the immobilized NPs usually suffer from detachment or migration during the catalytic process owing to their weak interactions with the matrices. Here, we developed a facile approach for the synthesis of high active and stable heterogeneous catalysts by entrapping Pd and Ru NPs in 3D ordered hierarchically porous inverse opal carbon (IOC). For these catalysts, the 3D open-porous structure on multiple length scales provides the reactants easy access to the catalytically active NPs while the entrapment of NPs inside IOC ensures their high dispersion and stability during the catalysis. As a result, the as-prepared catalysts exhibited both high activity and stability for the oxidation of CO and electrocatalysis of VO2+/VO2+ redox couples. The conversion rate of CO over the IOC-PdNPs catalyst reached >98% at 200 degrees C, which showed no decrease after reacting for 10 h. The IOC-RuNPs-based working electrode exhibited highly reversible redox potentials at 1.25 V and 0.78 V, respectively, and no change of peak currents and peak potential separation were observed for 200 cycles of cyclic voltammetry (CV) measurements.

The fractal analysis with a(lns) diagrams from dielectric relaxation spectroscopy as functions proposed a new strategy to shed light on the dual nature of ion-water and dipole-water cooperative interactions. A distinct cooperative interaction of ion-water and dipole-water is observed and water molecules perturbed by ions contributing to dielectric constant beyond the first hydration shell is obtained.

J	Zhang, DG				Zhang, Degang			In-gap bound states induced by interstitial Fe impurities in iron-based superconductors	PHYSICA C-SUPERCONDUCTIVITY AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Iron-based superconductors; Interstitial Fe impurities; In-gap bound states	ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; MAGNETIC ORDER	Based on a two-orbit four-band tight binding model, we investigate the low-lying electronic states around the interstitial excess Fe ions in the iron-based superconductors by using T-matrix approach. It is shown that the local density of states at the interstitial Fe impurity (IFI) possesses a strong resonance inside the gap, which seems to be insensitive to the doping and the pairing symmetry in the Fe-Fe plane, while a single or two resonances appear at the nearest neighboring (NN) Fe sites. The location and height of the resonance peaks only depend on the hopping t and the pairing parameter Delta(I) between the IFI and the NN Fe sites. These in-gap resonances are originated in the Andreev's bound states due to the quasiparticle tunneling through the IFI, leading to the change of the magnitude of the superconducting order parameter. When both t and Delta(I) are small, this robust zero energy bound state near the IFI is consistent with recent scanning tunneling microscopy observations. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

As a result, graphene-MWCNT aerogels possess ultra-low thermal conductivities (similar to 0.056 W m(-1) K-1) and apparent density (similar to 24 kg m(-3)), thereafter the figure of merit (ZT) of similar to 0.001 is achieved. Although the ZT value is too low for practical application as a thermoelectric (TE) material, the unique structure in this project provides a potential way to overcome the challenge in bulk semiconductors that increasing electrical conductivity generally leads to decreased Seebeck coefficient and enhanced thermal conductivity.

ADMINISTRATION OF LACTOBACILLUS HELVETICUS NS8 IMPROVES BEHAVIORAL, COGNITIVE, AND BIOCHEMICAL ABERRATIONS CAUSED BY CHRONIC RESTRAINT STRESS	NEUROSCIENCE			English	Article						Lactobacillus helveticus; chronic restraint stress; depression; microbiota-gut-brain axis; BDNF; serotonin	ANXIETY-LIKE BEHAVIOR; DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIORS; IRRITABLE-BOWEL-SYNDROME; GUT-BRAIN AXIS; SEX-DIFFERENCES; BIFIDOBACTERIUM-LONGUM; MICROBIAL-POPULATIONS; PSYCHOLOGICAL STRESS; RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; PROBIOTIC TREATMENT	Increasing numbers of studies have suggested that the gut microbiota is involved in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders. Chronic stress can cause behavioral, cognitive, biochemical, and gut microbiota aberrations. Gut bacteria can communicate with the host through the microbiota-gut-brain axis (which mainly includes the immune, neuroendocrine, and neural pathways) to influence brain and behavior. It is hypothesized that administration of probiotics can improve chronic-stress-induced depression. In order to examine this hypothesis, the chronic restraint stress depression model was established in this study. Adult specific pathogen free (SPF) Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to 21 days of restraint stress followed by behavioral testing (including the sucrose preference test (SPT), elevated-plus maze test, open-field test (OFT), object recognition test (ORT), and object placement test (OPT)) and biochemical analysis. Supplemental Lactobacillus helveticus NS8 was provided every day during stress until the end of experiment, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram (CIT) served as a positive control. Results showed that L. helveticus NS8 improved chronic restraint stress-induced behavioral (anxiety and depression) and cognitive dysfunction, showing an effect similar to and better than that of CIT. L. helveticus NS8 also resulted in lower plasma corticosterone (CORT) and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels, higher plasma interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, restored hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) and norepinephrine (NE) levels, and more hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA expression than in chronic stress rats. Taken together, these results indicate an anti-depressant effect of L. helveticus NS8 in rats subjected to chronic restraint stress depression and that this effect could be due to the microbiota-gut-brain axis. They also suggest the therapeutic potential of L. helveticus NS8 in stress-related and possibly other kinds of depression. (C) 2015 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We find that the internode process, as well as the unique three-dimensional spin-momentum locking, has significant influences on the RKKY interaction, resulting in both a Heisenberg and an Ising term, and an additional Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya term if the inversion symmetry is absent. These interactions can lead to rich spin textures and possible ferromagnetism in Dirac and time-reversal symmetry-invariant Weyl SMs. The effect of anisotropic Dirac and Weyl nodes on the RKKY interaction is also discussed. Our results provide an alternative scheme to engineer topological SMs and shed new light on the application of Dirac and Weyl SMs in spintronics.

The genus Gordonia comprises metabolically diverse bacteria that can degrade a wide range of persistent compounds. This paper reports the multiplicity of genes encoding 3-ketosteroid Delta(1)-dehydrogenase (KstD) in Gordonia neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. KstD is one of the key enzymes in microbial steroid catabolism. Five kstD homologues (kstD1-kstD5) distributed over several phylogenetic groups were investigated in G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395. Escherichia coli cells expressing kstD homologues were used to transform different steroids, including cholesterol, cholest-4-en-3-one, 4-androstene-3,17-dione (AD), progesterone, and 16 alpha, 17 alpha-epoxyprogesterone. All five enzymes displayed KstD activity toward 3-ketosteroids, but none were able to transform 3-hydroxysteroid substrates such as cholesterol. KstD2, KstD3, and KstD5 catalyzed the dehydrogenation reaction of 16 alpha, 17 alpha-epoxyprogesterone, while KstD1, KstD3, and KstD4 transformed AD into androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione. Transcriptional analyses revealed that the expression of kstD1, kstD3, and kstD4 was upregulated during culture in cholesterol or AD when compared with expression during culture in pyruvic acid. kstD2 and kstD5 were uniquely induced by cholesterol. Thus, the presence of multiple kstD genes in the G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 genome facilitates a dynamic and fine-tuned response to environmental changes.

J	Jia, FY; Ran, M; Zhang, B				Jia Fei-yun; Ran Ming; Zhang Bo			Theoretical study on the influence of different para-substituents on C-13 NMR of the single carbonyl curcumin analogues	RUSSIAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article						NMR; theoretical study; curcumin analogues; chemical shift	CHEMICAL-SHIFTS; HYDROGEN	The structure of eight kinds of different para-substituents curcumin analogues has been optimized at the level of B3LYP/6-31G(d,p), under which the stability has been verified by means of vibration analysis. Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds have been studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of eight compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. The effect of ortho-substituents on bond lengths and bond angles is greater than para and meta. Different substituents and different positions of substituents all have different influence on NMR of the single carbonyl curcumin analogues. In general, after the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is substituted by other groups, the delta value of alpha-C changes significantly, the delta value of ortho-carbon atom may also have great change, but the delta value change of meta-carbon atoms is not too obvious. The effect of substituent electronegativity on alpha-C atoms presents obvious regularity, while the influence of conjugate effect on carbon atoms of benzene ring is more complex. Finally, the bigger substituted alkyl is, the more the delta value of alpha-C increases.

This study examines how the public's perceptions of the distributional fairness of the benefits of mining, procedural fairness in the interactions between the mining industry and society, and confidence in the governance arrangements surrounding the industry affect the public's trust in the mining industry and, in turn, their acceptance of mining activities at a national scale. The aim of this study was also to understand how the contexts in which mining companies operate influence the public's perceptions of and attitudes toward mining. To this end, large-scale national surveys were conducted in Australia (N = 5121), China (N = 5122), and Chile (N = 1598). The results reveal that the key predictors of the public's acceptance of the mining industry were found to be relatively low across all three countries. In addition, distributional fairness, procedural fairness, and confidence in governance were all found to affect acceptance of mining, both directly and indirectly, by influencing the level of public trust in the mining industry. The findings also reveal that each of these three elements predicted trust and acceptance to varying degrees across the three countries. This suggests that the different elements are variously important to the public in accepting mining activities in their own contextual landscapes, highlighting that acceptance of mining is highly context dependent. The relatively low public perceptions of the three key predictors further suggest that in order to achieve a more socially sustainable mining industry where social conflict around mining operations is minimised and the public is able to experience the benefits of resource development, both the mining industry and governments may need to review their own methods of engaging with citizens to build trust in those stakeholder relationships.

After introducing TiO2 nanoparticles, the thermal properties of the PVDF-HFP/PMMA/TiO2 composite polymer electrolyte (CPE) are remarkably improved: when the working temperature is up to 90 degrees C, the weight loss of CPE with 7% TiO2 is only 12.8% of that without TiO2, suggesting much higher thermal stability; the shrinkage of the CPE at 130 degrees C can also obviously decrease from 23.4% down to 14.4% after introducing TiO2 nanoparticles. In addition, the CPE exhibits much higher ionic conductivity and better electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the LiCoO2/Li cells with CPE exhibit good cyclic stability and C-rate performance: the capacity maintains 92.1% of the initial capacity after 50 cycles; the capacity can reach as large as similar to 80 mAhr(-1) even at 5 C. It is promising for PVDF-HFP/PMMA/TiO2 CPE to meet the practical demands of high-performance and thermal safety for lithium ion batteries. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa Yi), is a staple food for the endangered giant panda, but little is known about the impact of drought on bamboo species and its recovery mechanism. This study investigated the response of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolism to drought and subsequent recovery, and the relationship of their metabolites with lipid peroxidation. Photochemistry was reversibly down-regulated after drought, but a longer recovery time is needed. The accelerated degradation of starch due to a rapid increase in amylase activity resulted in higher soluble sugar only in severe drought-stressed plants after 30 days of drought. Sucrose content was not affected by drought because of the relative increases in activities of invertase, sucrose synthase, and sucrose phosphate synthase. As nitrate concentration increased in parallel with nitrate reductase activity, ammonium (NH4 (+)) production was enhanced by drought. Also, activated glutamine synthetase/glutamate synthase cycle stimulated NH4 (+) assimilation, while hydrolysis of soluble proteins was accelerated, resulting in accumulation of amino acids. After rewatering, re-balancing of C metabolism has gradually begun, but a stronger N metabolism was still observed. The notable positive correlations between MDA and the contents of starch and proline after 15 days of drought as well as between MDA and the contents of soluble sugar, NSC and proline after 30 days of drought were displayed. We conclude that dwarf bamboo may not only differently regulate its C and N metabolism to improve the capacity of osmotic adjustment but also employ its different metabolites protect against membrane lipid peroxidation under different intensities and duration of drought, thus accelerating its recovery after rewatering.

An Improved Attribute Reduction Algorithm based on Granular Computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL			English	Article						attribute reduction; granular computing; rough set; attribute significance		Granular computing is a new intelligent computing method based on problem solving, information processing and pattern classification. Granular computing based attribute reduction method is an important application of Granular computing. These algorithms are mostly based on reduction core. However, some information systems may have no reduction core, especially in the actual application data. For this case, those algorithms are powerless. In this paper, an improved reduction algorithm based on granular computing is proposed. The algorithm is validated by the experimental result.

It is shown that for any choice of reasonably regular initial data (u(0), v(0), w(0)), there exists a constant lambda* depending on alpha, rho, mu, gamma, eta, v(0) and wo such that for any lambda > lambda*, the associated initial boundary system possesses a global classical solution which is uniformly bounded. Moreover, building on this boundedness property, it is proved that as time tends to infinity, all the solution approaches the homogeneous steady state (1, 0, 1) in an appropriate sense.

Room temperature x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) patterns showed that the structures of as-prepared Bi1-xLaxFe0.90Co0.05Ti0.05O3 solid solutions transformed from rhombohedral R3c to tetragonal P4mm and then to orthorhombic Pnma, with increasing La concentration from 0 to 1. In situ high-temperature XRD (HTXRD) analysis further revealed that rhombohedral structure R3c (x <= 0.16) and tetragonal structure P4mm (0.17 <= x <= 0.40) changed to orthorhombic Pnma along with increasing temperature, and the phase transition temperature decreased with the increase of La doping concentration. However, the orthorhombic structure Pnma (x >= 0.41) kept stable even when the temperature reached 850 degrees C. The phase diagram of as-prepared binary solid solutions of Bi1-xLaxFe0.90Co0.05Ti0.05O3(x = 0-1) was drawn on the basis of XRD and HTXRD analysis. Magnetic measurement revealed that the magnetic properties are greatly enhanced with the increase of La content. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Deterioration of the coercivity due to the diffusion induced interface layer in hard/soft multilayers	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							ANISOTROPIC NANOCOMPOSITE FILMS; ENERGY PRODUCT; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MAGNETS; BILAYERS; MEDIA; 3D	Hard/soft permanent magnets have aroused many interests in the past two decades because of their potential in achieving giant energy products as well as their rich variety of magnetic behaviors. Nevertheless, the experimental energy products are much smaller than the theoretical ones due to the much smaller coercivity measured in the experiments. In this paper, the deterioration of the coercivity due to the interface atomic diffusion is demonstrated based on a three dimensional (3D) micromagnetic software (OOMMF) and a formula derived for the pinning field in a hard/soft multilayer, which can be applied to both permanent magnets and exchange-coupled-composite (ECC) media. It is found that the formation of the interface layer can decrease the coercivity by roughly 50%, which is responsible for the observed smaller coercivity in both composite and single-phased permanent magnets. A method to enhance the coercivity in these systems is proposed based on the discussions, consistent with recent experiments where excellent magnetic properties are achieved.	[Si, Wenjing; Zhao, G.

A transparent gap is introduced between photoresist film and polystyrene microspheres to adjust light distribution of photoresist surface. The pores size on the photoresist film varies when the gap thickness is changed. By optimization gap thickness and exposure dose, sub-100 nm surface patterning array is achieved for sphere of 2.06 mu m diameter and optical wavelength. of 400 nm theoretically and experimentally. Furthermore, when smaller polystyrene sphere (1.25 mu m diameter) is chosen, spot width of 35 nm is realized by numerical calculation.

The mixture behavior is described by the Davidson-Cole model using four parameters that relate to molecular structure. The hydrogen bond (HB) numbers and binding energies between two pairs (solute solute and solute-solvent pairs) are estimated by Luzar model, also the type of dipolar ordering which depends on the extent of DMF is obtained. The combination of the excess inverse permittivity and the Luzar model gives a satisfactory explanation and valuable insights into the underlying of the relaxation acts.

Herein, we demonstrate the first example of regulating the redox activity of c-Cyts in a living microorganism through heme axial ligation to target high extracellular electron transfer (EET). The direct electrochemistry of Shewanella oneidensis amended with an axial ligand (imidazole) delivered a 1.5-fold increase in the biocurrent, demonstrating enhanced EET. Invivo UV/Vis and Raman spectra confirmed the axial ligation of imidazoles to the c-Cyts. Density functional calculations revealed the optimized electronic structure and lowered reorganization energy values of the imidazole-ligated heme, which benefited EET. These findings provide, not only a better understanding of the mechanism underlying the EET, but also new insights into the enhanced EET.

It is found that the pinning fields exhibit an angular symmetry where the minimum occurs at beta = 45 degrees, similar to that according to the well-known Stoner-Wohlfarth model. For intermediate soft layer thickness, the Kondorsly-like pinning is observed, where the pinning fields increase monotonically with beta. On the other hand, the pinning field HP goes up monotonically with t(h) for all values of beta when the hard layer thickness is less than roughly three times of its domain wall width.	[Zhao, G.

In the face of climate change, maintenance and improvement in its productivity is very necessary for the management of the giant pandas' habitats. However, the regulatory mechanisms underlying plant responses to water deficit are poorly known. To investigate the effects of P application on photosynthetic C and N metabolism, water use efficiency (WUE) and growth of dwarf bamboo under water deficit, a completely randomized design with two factors of two watering (well-watered and water-stressed) and two P regimes (with and without P fertilization) was arranged. P application hardly changed growth, net CO2 assimilation rate (P-n) and WUE in well-watered plants but significantly increased relative growth rate (RGR) and P-n in water-stressed plants. The effect of P application on RGR under water stress was mostly associated with physiological adjustments rather than with differences in biomass allocation. P application maintained the balance of C metabolism in well-watered plants, but altered the proportion of nitrogenous compounds in N metabolism. By contrast, P application remarkably increased sucrose-metabolizing enzymes activities with an obvious decrease in sucrose content in water-stressed plants, suggesting an accelerated sucrose metabolism. Activation of nitrogen-metabolizing enzymes in water-stressed plants was attenuated after P application, thus slowing nitrate reduction and ammonium assimilation. P application hardly enlarged the phenotypic plasticity of dwarf bamboo in response to water in the short term. Generally, these examined traits of dwarf bamboo displayed weak or negligible responses to water-P interaction. In conclusion, P application could accelerate P-n and sucrose metabolism and slow N metabolism in water-stressed dwarf bamboo, and as a result improved RGR and alleviated damage from soil water deficit.

It can be shown that two distant senders can simultaneously and deterministically exchange their states with the other senders under the control of the supervisor. In order to extend BCJRSP, we generalize this protocol from five participants to multi participants utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel and propose two generalized BCJRSP schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the BCJRSP to multidirectional controlled joint remote state preparation by utilizing multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel. By integrating bidirectional quantum teleportation, quantum state sharing and joint remote state preparation, some modified versions are discussed. Only Pauli operations and single-qubit measurements are used in our schemes, so the scheme with five-party is easily realized in physical experiment.

In this work, the structural, thermodynamic, elastic, and electronic properties of alpha-SnS have been investigated by the plane wave pseudo-potential density functional theory with the framework of generalised gradient approximation. The calculated pressure-dependent lattice parameters agree well with the available experimental data. Our thermodynamic properties of alpha-SnS, including heat capacity C-P, entropy S, and Gibbs free energy relation of -(G(T) - H-0) curves, show similar growth trends as the experimental data. At T = 298.15 K, our C-P = 52.31 J/mol.K, S = 78.93 J/mol.K, and -(G(T) - H-0) = 12.03 J/mol all agree very well with experimental data C-P = 48.77 J/mol.K and 49.25 J/mol.K, S = 76.78 J/mol.K, and -(G(T) - H-0) = 12.38 J/mol. The elastic constants, together with other elastic properties, are also computed. The anisotropy analyses indicate obvious elastic anisotropy for alpha-SnS along different symmetry planes and axes. Moreover, calculations demonstrate that alpha-SnS is an indirect gap semiconductor, and it transforms to semimetal with pressure increasing up to 10.2 GPa. Combined with the density of states, the characters of the band structure have been analysed in detail.

The ceramics with low Dy levels (x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.015) show a pure perovskite structure, while a small amount of secondary phase DyNbO4 can be detected in the ceramics with x a parts per thousand yen 0.02. The increase in the level of Dy3+ doping leads to the shift of crystal structure of the ceramics from the coexistence of orthorhombic-tetragonal phases to pseudo-cubic phase. The addition of Dy3+ inhibits the grain growth of the ceramics and induces the diffusive phase transition in the ceramics with high levels of Dy3+ ions. The piezoelectric constant d (33) of the ceramics decreases from 198 to 52 pC/N with x increasing from 0 to 0.03 because of the shift of the crystal structure of the ceramics from the coexistence of orthorhombic-tetragonal phase to pseudo-cubic phase. The Dy-doped ceramics excited at 453 nm have excellent luminescent properties. Two strong emission spectral bands centered at 476 and 573 nm are observed, corresponding to the transition of the F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) levels of Dy3+, respectively. Our study shows that the ceramic with x = 0.015 possesses simultaneously strong ferroelectricity, good piezoelectricity and excellent luminescence, suggesting that the Dy-doped ceramics may have potential application in multifunctional devices.

The transport mechanism of coupled particles in the overdamped limit is investigated as the function of the temperature of baths, coupling constant and natural length of the spring, the amplitude and frequency of driving force, and the asymmetry of ratchet potential by numerical stimulations. The results indicate that the damping force involving the information of historical velocity leads to the nonlocal memory property and blocks the traditional dissipative motion behaviors, and it even plays a cooperative role of driving force in drift motion of the coupled particles. Thus, we observe various non-monotonic resonance-like behaviors of collective directed transport in the mediums with different diffusion exponents. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Their structures and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), specific surface analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra, photoluminescence spectra (PL) and X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS). SEM, EDS and TEM analyses verified that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs composites have been successfully prepared. PL analysis illustrated that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs have the lower emission peak intensities, compared with Ag3PO4 and WO3. By using simultaneous decontaminations of Cr(VI) and orange II as model reactions, the photocatalytic efficiencies of Ag3PO4, WO3 and Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs were evaluated. The reaction results showed that Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs have strong photocatalytic activities. The effect of Ag3PO4:WO3 ratio on the photocatalytic activity was systemically studied. The catalyst AWM(7/3) was found to exhibit the highest photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. The improvement of photocatalytic activity and stability was mainly attributed to the highly effective separation of photo-generated electron-hole pairs and special transfer pathway of electrons and holes in Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs composites. Therefore, the prepared Ag3PO4-WO3/MWCNTs could act as a high-performance catalyst for the simultaneous decontaminations of Cr(VI) and orange II, and also suggested the promising applications.

J	Yang, T; Ji, XL; Li, XQ				Yang Ting; Ji Xiao-Ling; Li Xiao-Qing			Propagation characteristics of partially coherent decentred annular beams propagating through oceanic turbulence	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						oceanic turbulence; partially coherent decentred annular beam; position of the maximum intensity; centroid position		The analytical expressions for the average intensity and the centroid position of partially coherent decentred annular beams propagating through oceanic turbulence are derived, and the propagation equation of the position of the maximum intensity is also given. Changes of the average intensity, the centroid position and the position of the maximum intensity of partially coherent decentred annular beams during propagation are studied in detail. It is shown that both in free space and in oceanic turbulence, the position of the maximum intensity moves to the propagation z-axis with increasing the propagation distance, and is kept unchanged when the propagation distance is large enough. Furthermore, in free space the position of the maximum intensity is closer to the propagation z-axis than to the centroid position when the propagation distance is large enough. The position of the maximum intensity is closer to the propagation z-axis with increasing the correlation parameter, and far from the propagation z-axis with increasing the decentered parameter and the obscure ratio. However, in oceanic turbulence the position of the maximum intensity is close to the centroid position when the propagation distance is large enough, and the evolution is speeded with increasing the strength of oceanic turbulence. The influence of the beam coherence on propagation characteristics decreases due to oceanic turbulence. On the other hand, the centroid position is independent of the beam coherence, the propagation distance and the oceanic turbulence. The centroid position is far from the propagation z-axis with increasing the decentered parameter and the obscure ratio. In addition, the hollow core of partially coherent decentred annular beams is filled up as the propagation distance increases, and the evolution is speeded with increasing the strength of oceanic turbulence. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for applications of partially coherent decentred annular beams in oceanic turbulence.

Essential oil; 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene; alpha-Terpinene; Breast cancer MCF-7 cells; Antitumor activity	LEAF ESSENTIAL OIL; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITY	Purpose: To investigate the most effective compound of C. ambrosioides essential oil for the induction of cell death in human breast cancer cells (MCF-7), and the mechanism of induction. Methods: MCF-7 cells were treated with essential oil and its two main components, 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and alpha-terpinene, respectively, for 24 and 48 h in vitro. To determine their cytotoxicity on MCF-7 cells, in vitro cytotoxicity, 3-(4, 5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and live/dead cell fluorescent staining were used. MCF-7 cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) vitality and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were also evaluated. Results: MTT results showed that essential oil and its two main compositions significantly inhibited the growth of MCF-7 cells in 24 h (p < 0.05), which was consistent with the Live/dead cell fluorescent staining results. After 24 h incubation the average inhibition rate is 58.98 % for essential oil, 37.8 % for 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and 32.09 % for alpha-terpinene. With increase in the concentration of essential oil and the two main components, the relative activity of SOD significantly decreased (p < 0.05), while the relative activity of CAT was gradually increased (p < 0.05), compared with control. MDA relative content significantly increased (p < 0.05) until the concentration was 1.25, 0.21 and 0.17 mu g/ml for essential oil, 1-isopropyl-4-methylbenzene and alpha-terpinene, and thereafter significantly decreased (p < 0.05), compared to control. Conclusion: The data suggest that the essential oil of C. ambrosioides and its two main components inhibit MCF-7 cell proliferation cell death by inducing oxidative damage. However, the two main components are less effective in their anticancer activity than the essential oil	[Wang Ya-Nan; Wu Jia-Liang; Ma Dan-Wei; Li Jiao; Zhang Du-Yu] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China	Wang, YN (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Life Sci, Chengdu 610101, Peoples R China.	yanan.w@163.com			National Fund Nature Science of China [31370549]; Education Office of Sichuan Province and cell Institute Sichuan Normal University in China	This work was financially supported by the National Fund Nature Science of China (No. 31370549), the Education Office of Sichuan Province and cell Institute Sichuan Normal University in China.		27	3	4	0	16	PHARMACOTHERAPY GROUP	BENIN CITY	UNIV BENIN, FACULTY PHARMACY, BENIN CITY, 00000, NIGERIA	1596-5996			TROP J PHARM RES	Trop.

We have also computed the six independent components(C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33, C-44, C-66). The mechanical stability of CuGaSe2 is confirmed by using the above independent components. Moreover the pressure and temperature dependences of the Debye temperature Theta, thermal expansion coefficient alpha and heat capacities C-V and C-P were predicted by using the quasi-harmonic Debye model.

Cultures of S. polyrhiza were grown in dilutions of both original swine wastewater (OSW) and anaerobic digestion effluent (ADE) based on total ammonia nitrogen (TAN). Results showed that elevated concentrations of TAN caused decreased growth, carbon fixation, and energy production rates, particularly just after the first rise in two types of swine wastewater. Also, OSW was more suitable for S. polyrhiza cultivation than ADE. Maximum carbon and energy fixation were achieved at OSW-TAN concentrations of 12.08 and 13.07 mg L-1, respectively. Photosynthetic activity of S. polyrhiza could be inhibited by both nutrient stress (in high-concentration wastewater) and nutrient limitation (in low-concentration wastewater), affecting its growth and ability for carbon-energy fixation.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure with rhombohedral symmetry. The addition of a small amount of Co2O3 enhances the ferroelectricity, ferromagnetism, piezoelectricity and temperature stability of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 1.0 possesses enhanced piezoelectricity (d(33) = 134pC/N), good ferroelectricity (P-r = 19.9 mu C/cm(2)) and increased high depolarization temperature (T-d = 475 degrees C). The 1 mol% Co2O3 doping greatly improves the ferromagnetic property of the ceramics and the optimum remnant magnetization M-r of 0.191 emu/g of the ceramic is obtained at x = 1.0. These results show that the ceramic with x = 1.0 is a promising candidate for lead-free high-temperature piezoelectric and room-temperature multiferrioc materials.

Once an operating component breaks down, it is repaired by a repair facility. Moreover, the repair facility is subject to failure during the repair period which results in repair interruptions. Failed repair facility resumes repair after a random period of time. Under such assumptions, applying the quasi-birth-and-death process and the matrix-analytical approach, the system state probabilities are derived. In addition, various steady-state system performance measures such as the availability and the rate of occurrence of failure along with some numerical illustrations are reported. Finally, under a profit structure, we use the direct search method and the parabolic method to search for the optimal system parameters.

All the ceramics possessed typical bismuth layer structure with m = 4, belonging to orthorhombic symmetry, and no secondary phase was detected. The plate-like grains were observed in all the ceramics, and the grain growth was slightly inhibited after the addition of Eu. Saturated polarization hysteresis loops were observed for all the ceramics, and the remanent polarization P (r) decreased with Eu doping. The Eu-doped ceramics had a sharp excitation band centered at 465 nm due to the f-f transition from the F-7(0) ground state to the D-5(2) excited state of Eu3+. Under the excitation by 465 nm light, the main emission peaks located at 595 nm and 616 nm were obtained, which corresponds to the transition of D-5(0)-F-7(1), 5D(0)-F-7(2) levels in Eu3+, respectively. Our study shows that CaBi4Ti4O15 ceramics may be a promising multifunctional material for potential applications in optical-electro integration devices.

The lattice parameters (a, c and u) are directly calculated and agree well with previous experimental and theoretical results. The obtained negative formation enthalpy shows that ZnGeP2 crystal has strong structural stability. We have also calculated the bulk modulus B and the elastic parameters (C-11, C-12, C-13, C-33, C-44, and C-65) which have not been measured yet. The accuracy and reliability of the calculated elastic constants of ZnGeP2 crystal are discussed. In addition, the pressure and temperature dependencies of the lattice parameters, bulk modulus, Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, entropy, volume thermal expansion coefficient, and specific heat capacity are obtained in the ranges of 0-20 GPa and 0-1200 K using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. To our knowledge this is the first quantitative theoretical prediction of the thermodynamic properties for ZnGeP2 compound and still awaits experimental confirmations. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

The structural stability, thermodynamic stability together with mechanical stability show that Re2N-Os2C, OsB2-OsC2, trigonal P (3) over bar m1 OsC2, trigonal P (3) over bar m1 OsC3, orthorhombic Cmmm OsC4 and Ru2Ge3-Os2C3 are the most stable structure for each kind of compounds. But, OsB2-OsC2 and Ru2Ge3-Os2C3 are dynamically unstable based on the calculation of phonon dispersion. The formation enthalpies under high pressure indicate that the Re2N-Os2C, P (3) over bar m1 OsC3, Cmmm OsC4 and Os2Si3-O2C3 (P4c2) have structural stabilities in the entire range of pressure. While for OsC2, there is a high pressure phase transition exists above 40 GPa. In addition, all the studied osmium carbides exhibit metallic behavior and strong covalent bonding. According to the calculated Vicker hardness based on a semiempirical method, we found that the OsC4 with Cmmm space group has the largest hardness value (28.4 GPa). Combined with its largest shear modulus and Yong's modulus, smallest Poission's ratio and low B/G ratio, we predict it is a potential superhard material. By the comparison between the crystal structure of OsC2 and OsC3, it is found that the increased C-C bonds in a cell increase their hardness, whereas the ionicity Os-Os bonds are unfavorable.

Optomechanically induced transparency and absorption in hybridized optomechanical systems	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; SLOW LIGHT	We present the normal-mode splitting and optomechanically induced transparency or absorption phenomena in the strongly tunnel-coupled optomechanical cavities. In the probe output spectrum, there appear central transparency windows or absorption peaks around which two broad sidebands are symmetrically located. It has been confirmed by the quantitative findings that two broad sidebands, which include the distorted absorption peaks, indicate the normal-mode splitting of the two hybridized cavities, and central transparency windows or absorption peaks character the interference induced by the optomechanical interactions. Additionally, the switching from absorption to amplification can be realized by only adjusting the tunnel interaction. These spectrum properties can be used for the coherent control of light pulses via microfabricated optomechanical arrays.	[Hou, B.

A village doctor-based cognitive behavioral therapy intervention may be one way of improving accessibility. The purpose of this study was to explore the advantages and challenges of implementing this intervention, as delivered by trained village doctors, to treat late-life depression in rural China. Methods We conducted one focus group discussion with 10 village doctors, 10 individual interviews with each of the village doctors, and individual interviews with 19 older adults. The topic guides were advantages and challenges of the intervention program from the perspective of the village doctors and older adults. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, coded using NVivo 8, and analyzed using thematic analysis. Results The village doctors stressed the importance of role-playing and using instructive manuals in the training. Proper supervision was also a key component of the program. The benefits received from the intervention for the village doctors and the elders were positive such that both the doctors and the older adults were willing to implement/receive this intervention. Cultural and political factors (renqing and perceived policy consideration) facilitated the elders' access to mental health services. Challenges included a lack of real therapy (in contrast to role-playing) demonstrated in the training and lack of a step-by-step manual based on different types of problems encountered. Other impediments to the successful implementation of the intervention included the time constraints of village doctors and the presence of other people when conducting the intervention. Conclusions The present study has demonstrated that the intervention program is likely to be an acceptable geriatric depression intervention in rural China if several challenges are appropriately addressed.

The majority of studies on Chinese urbanization have been focused on coastal areas, while with less attention given to urban centers in the west. Chengdu, western China, however is undergoing significant urban growth due to rapid economic development and demographic growth. This research examines urban expansion in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data, urban expansion model, buffer analysis of geographic information system (GIS) and quadrant orientation analysis. Driving forces of urban expansion are also examined based on principle component analysis (PCA). Results indicate that the urbanized area increased by more than 17 times, up to 1910.2 km(2) from 1978 to 2010, the urban expansion rate and intensity increased significantly and exhibited the spatiotemporal heterogeneity. We found that urban expansion patterns changed from patch infilling to patch margin expansion, and the expansion direction is primarily toward the northwest, west and southwest. The results suggest an obvious trend of urban expansion in Chengdu witnessed in coastal cities of China. The information provided by this research ultimately helped impact on future policies and plans for better land management and urban sustainability. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Spin-polarized Wannier functions for the two-dimensional topological insulators	EPL			English	Article								We propose that the topological properties of the two-dimensional topological insulators can be classified by the evolution of the centers of the spin-polarized Wannier functions. Numerical results are obtained based upon a modified Kane-Mele model with next-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and a uniform exchange field. The centers of the spin-polarized Wannier functions are shown to display different spectral flow patterns in different quantum phases, characterizing the topological structures of the bulk energy bands.

These interactions create a steady environment for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Thus understanding these interactions between ATP and F-1-ATPase is essential for understanding ATP synthesis/hydrolysis mechanism. We performed all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to elucidate these interactions and attempted to identify key residues which play important roles in stabilizing and positioning ATP. By examining the non-bonded energies between ATP and residues of beta(TP) subunit in F-1-ATPase, it is found that residues 158-164, R189, Y345 have significant interactions with ATP. The loop segment (residues 158-164) and R189 surround ATP by a half and they interact with beta and gamma phosphates through forming a network of hydrogen bonds to constraint the motion of ATP triphosphate. The interaction network seals off the conformation of the catalytic site, creating a steady environment for ATP synthesis/hydrolysis. Additionally, ATP base is positioned by the pi-pi stacking interaction from Y345. However, ATP base can slide and move paralleling to the aromatic group of Y345. It is deduced that this motion may facilitate ATP hydrolysis.

By defining some suitable functionals and a constrained variational problem, we first establish the existence of standing waves, which relys on the inner structure of the equations under consideration to overcome the drawback that nonlocal terms violate the space-scale invariance. We then show the orbital instability of standing waves. The arguments depend upon the conservation laws of the mass and of the energy.

By using formic acid, mercury vapor was generated under the irradiation of UV light, and then the vapor was introduced into the corona discharge area with the carrier gas flow of argon. The optical signals were captured and analyzed by the charge-coupled device detector at 253.7 nm. Under the optimized conditions of 4% formic acid, discharge voltage of 90 V, and at carrier gas flow rate of 200 mL min(-1), the stable detection signals were obtained (RSD - 2.5%). The calibration curve was plotted with the concentration of mercury ranging from 0.5 ng mL(-1) to 1000 ng mL(-1), with a correlation coefficient > 0.99 and the limit of detection of 0.03 ng mL(-1). Two certified reference materials were analyzed, and a t-test demonstrated that the determined results by the proposed method had no significant difference with the certified values at the confidence level of 95%. Water samples collected from both Funan River in Chengdu and Lotus Pond on campus of Sichuan University were analyzed as well, with the recoveries of standard addition between 93.8% and 103%. The miniaturized instrumentation demonstrated several advantages such as easy construction, low power consumption, high sensitivity, and portability for field analysis.

In this letter, we propose an incentive framework within which the macrocell base station (MBS) provides profit to femtocells by pricing accessed MUEs' transmission rates guaranteed by FAPs. A Stackelberg game is formulated to maximize the utility functions of both the MBS and FAPs. The Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) for the proposed game is investigated and the best strategies for both tiers are obtained. Numerical results show that utility functions of FAPs can be improved significantly, which provides strong motivation for FAPs to adopt hybrid access and implement the proposed framework.

This particular population has received increasing attention from researchers. The goals of the present study are to describe longitudinally the prevalence and the severity of PTSD in adolescent survivors of the Yushu earthquake in China and to explore the risk factors which lead to psychiatric disorders. The PTSD Check List (Civilian Version) was used to assess the PTSD symptoms in participants. The rates of PTSD were found to be 10.9% after 6 months and 5.8% after 24 months. Bereavement, being buried in the ruins, and personal injury were found to be significant risk factors for the development of PTSD. We suggest that intervention strategies should be addressed and more attention should be paid to adolescents.

An optimization model based on the maximizing deviation method, by which the attribute weights can be determined, is established. For the special situations where the information about attribute weights is completely unknown, we establish another optimization model. By solving this model, we get a simple and exact formula, which can be used to determine the attribute weights. We utilize the interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy weighted averaging operator to aggregate the interval intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy information corresponding to each alternative, and then rank the alternatives and select the most desirable one(s) according to the score function and accuracy function. Finally, an illustrative example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

The calculated equilibrium lattice and the normalized crystal parameters as a function of pressure are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data. Elastic constants C-ij are calculated in the pressure range of 0-50GPa, and the bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, and Young's modulus E are also obtained according to the Voigt-Reuss-Hill (VRH) approximation. Anisotropic indexes are employed to characterize the mechanical anisotropy. The bulk modulus and Young's modulus as a function of crystal orientations are also investigated. The obtained results suggest that CrB4 exhibits a pronounced elastic anisotropy. It is strongest along the b-axis in response to compression loading, and the {100} and {001} shear planes might be the cleavage planes. The elastic anisotropy of CrB4 may possibly limit its applications. Using the quasiharmonic Debye model, thermodynamic properties like Debye temperature, Gruneisen parameter, heat capacity, and expansion coefficient are also systematically explored under extreme P-T conditions.

After the partial substitution of Ho3+ for Bi3+, a new Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based solid solution with a pure perovskite structure is formed. The doping of Ho3+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure of the ceramics. After the addition of a small amount of Ho3+ (x = 0.015), the piezoelectricity (d (33) = 187 pC/N, k (p) = 41.1 %, respectively) and ferroelectricity (P (r) = 25.2 mu C/cm(2)) of ceramics are enhanced. The down-conversion and up-conversion photoluminescence of the ceramics are observed. A green down-conversion emission band at 548 nm is observed which is from the S-5(2) -> I-5(8) transition of Ho3+; the main down-conversion excitation bands located at 410-500 nm is due to the I-5(8) -> (5)G(5, 6) transitions, and the maximum brightness of down-conversion photoluminescence are obtained at x = 0.015. The ceramic with x = 0.01 exhibits the maximum value of the up-conversion emission at 475 nm, which is attributed to the F-5(3) -> I-5(8) transition. Our study shows that the ceramics with x = 0.01-0.02 exhibit simultaneously good piezoelectricity, strong ferroelectricity and excellent photoluminescence, suggesting a potential application in the electro-optic devices.

J	Zhou, LG; Lu, D; Fujita, H				Zhou, Ligang; Lu, Dong; Fujita, Hamido			The performance of corporate financial distress prediction models with features selection guided by domain knowledge and data mining approaches	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS			English	Article						Financial distress prediction; Features selection; Domain knowledge; Data mining	BANKRUPTCY PREDICTION; VARIABLE SELECTION; HYBRID	Experts in finance and accounting select feature subset for corporate financial distress prediction according to their professional understanding of the characteristics of the features, while researchers in data mining often believe that data alone can tell everything and they use various mining techniques to search the feature subset without considering the financial and accounting meanings of the features. This paper investigates the performance of different financial distress prediction models with features selection approaches based on domain knowledge or data mining techniques. The empirical results show that there is no significant difference between the best classification performance of models with features selection guided by data mining techniques and that by domain knowledge. However, the combination of domain knowledge and genetic algorithm based features selection method can outperform unique domain knowledge and unique data mining based features selection method on AUC performance.

Its structure and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra, X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), photoluminescence spectra (PL) and photocurrent techniques. SEM, TEM and EDS analyses verified that Agl-Ag3PO4 is successfully loaded on MWCNTs. Agl-ABsPati MWCNTs possess the absorption edge of red shift and small band gap energy, and could absorb more photons in the visible region. PL and photocurrent analyses illustrated that Agl-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs have the lowest emission peak intensity and the highest photoelectric current, compared with Ag3PO4, AgI and AgI-Ag3PO4. By using the photocatalytic degradation of mixed dyes wastewater of Orange II and ponceau 4R as a model reaction, the photocatalytic efficiencies of Ag3PO4, AgI, Agl-Ag3PO4 and AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNT5 were evaluated. The reaction results showed that AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs have strong photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. Therefore, the prepared AgI-Ag3PO4/MWCNTs could act as a high-performance catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of mixed dyes wastewater and also suggested the promising applications.

The catalytic properties of CA and platinum (Pt) counter electrodes are analyzed and compared by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Tafel polarization measurements. The devices applying CA counter electrode exhibit a lower charge-transfer resistance (1.60 Omega cm(2)) and larger diffusion coefficient (3.39 x 10(-6) cm(2) s(-1)) compared to the devices with conventional Pt counter electrode. As a new kind of porous carbon materials, CA counter electrode has high active surface area and conductance. These factors improve the power conversion efficiency (eta) up to 8.04%, which is better than that of the reference Pt based DSSC (6.79%). This paper indicates that carbon aerogel with good catalytic activity can potentially be used as a promising alternative to the expensive Pt counter electrode in a high-performance DSSC device design.

METHODS: Sixty-seven patients were enrolled in this study and divided into two groups: a trial group with 35 patients and a control group with 32 patients. The trial group was given TCCT for 3 months, then administered IVF-ET or awaited natural pregnancy. The control group was administered IVF-ET without TCCT 3 months after the previous IVF-ET or natural pregnancy attempt. The patterns of KLB were observed both before and after treatment. The natural pregnancy rate of the two groups was calculated after treatment. Differences between the two groups were compared after using IVF-ET treatment again in fertilized egg number and fertilization rate were evaluated. RESULTS: After treatment with TCM comprehensive therapy, seven patients in the treatment group became pregnant, while there were no successful conceptions in the control group. The difference in clinical pregnancy rate in the initial cycle and transfer cycle of IVF were significantly different (P < 0.05). The trial group had a significantly higher conception rate than that of the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: TCCT can promote the natural pregnancy rate in patients with previously failed IVF-ET. TCCT could increase patients' fertilized egg number, fertilization rate, pregnancy rate, and clinical pregnancy rate after another IVF-ET treatment. TCCT can also relieve the symptoms of KLB.

It is found that for the small orbital mirror size, a Gaussian beam with negative spherical aberration might be more strongly compressed without filamentation than that without spherical aberration, and its spot size on the ground can be reduced well below the diffraction limit. However, for the large orbital mirror size, spherical aberration will result in an increase of receiver size on the ground.

Herein, we report a study on 2D self-assembly of two kinds of triphenylene-submitted discotic mesogenic species, which have similar four TP moieties with alkyne spacer but different rigid aromatic cores pyrene and carbazole. Two types of stable periodic long-ranged supramolecular networks on the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite surface have been visualized via high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy technique. A comparative study reveals how the aromatic core of molecular building blocks affects achiral and chiral arrangement of discotic molecule on surface. The asymmetry backbone results in molecular orientation and varied van der Waals forces between molecule molecule and molecule substrate. Our results demonstrate that design of functional molecules plays an important role in the construction of 2D supramolecular assembly possessing desirable structure for the specific applications.

It is found that, when the zenith angle is not large enough, the saturation phenomenon of the scintillation index never appears even if the propagation distance is large enough, which is quite different from the behavior for the horizontal propagation case. However, under the same condition (i. e. the zenith angle is not large enough), the on-axis scintillation index still approaches an asymptotical value, which increases as the zenith angle increases, and depends on the obscure ratio of annular beams. Furthermore, the relation of the on-axis scintillation index between annular beams and flat-topped beams is also examined in this paper. It is shown that their relation will change as the zenith angle changes.

However, despite several interesting applications, only little quantitative research has been conducted on the temperature uniformity of the heating load. With water as a common inorganic solvent, a novel MCFR type based on a special ridged waveguide for heating water is studied by optimizing some parameters of micropipes in order to achieve better temperature uniformity. Compared to the original reactor, the standard deviation of the electric field decreased significantly when using the optimized reactor under the same heating conditions while the average electric field density increased.

As Ts increases from 880 degrees C to 1040 degrees C, the ceramics are transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal structure and a MPB is formed at T-s =1000 degrees C and t(s) = 2 h. The increase in T-s greatly improves the densification, electric insulation, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of the ceramics, while relatively weak dependences on t(s) are observed. As T-s increases from 880 degrees C to 1000 degrees C, the magnetism of the ceramics is significantly enhanced and the values of M-r are increased by similar to 400%. The optimum sintering conditions of the ceramic is 1000 degrees C/2 h, in which high density, good electric insulation and enhanced ferroelectricity (P-r= 18.4 mu C/cm(2)), piezoelectricity (d(33) = 140 pC/N, k(p) = 31.4%) and ferromagnetism (M-r = 0.099 emu/g) are simultaneously obtained.

The relative mean-squared beam width wR, the beta parameter and the energy Strehl ratio (SRE) are adopted to characterize the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability which defined by a certain energy and the energy within a given bucket radius, respectively. It is shown that, in general, the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability is large for thick annular beams, and is small for thin annular beams. However, it is found out that the laws of w(R), beta parameter and SRE versus the obscure ratio beta of annular beams are quite different, i.e., w(R) decreases monotonically as epsilon increases, while changes of beta parameter and SRE versus epsilon are not monotonic. There exists a maximum of beta for thick annular beams, and there exists a minimum of beta for thin annular beams. But there only exists a maximum of SRE for thin annular beams. The values of epsilon at which beta reaches its maximum or minimum and SRE reaches its maximum are nearly independent of the zenith angle of the slanted path. In practice, the minimum of beta and the maximum of SRE may be used, but the maximum of beta should be avoided. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

This family of triads consists of two side-on pending triphenylene mesogens, acting as the electron-donating groups (D), laterally connected through short lipophilic spacers to a central perylenediimide (PI), benzo[ghi]perylenediimide (BI), or coronenediimide (CI) molecular unit, respectively, playing the role of the electron acceptor (A). All D-A-D triads self-organize to form a lamello-columnar oblique mesophase, with a highly segregated donor-acceptor (D-A) heterojunction organization, consequent to efficient molecular self-sorting. The structure consists in the regular alternation of two disrupted rows of triphenylene columns and a continuous row of diimine species. High-resolution STM images demonstrate that PI-TP2 forms stable 2D self-assembly nanostructures with some various degrees of regularity, whereas the other triads do not self-organize into ordered architectures. The electron-transport mobility of CI-TP2, measured by time-of-flight at 200 degrees C in the mesophase, is one order of magnitude higher than the hole mobility. By means of this specific molecular designing idea, we realized and demonstrated for the first time the so-called p-n heterojunction at the molecular level in which the electron-rich triphenylene columns act as the hole transient pathways, and the coronenediimide stacks form the electron-transport channels.

Then an SM dgmain also satisfies the descending chain condition on those chains of v-ideals whose intersection is not zero. In this paper, a study is begun to extend these properties to commutative rings with zero divisors. A Q(0)-SM ring is defined to be a ring which satisfies the ascending chain condition on semiregular w-ideals and satisfies the descending chain condition on those chains of semiregular v-ideals whose intersection is semiregular. In this paper, some properties of Q(0)-SM rings are discussed and examples are provided to show the difference between Q(0)-SM rings and SM rings and the difference between Q(0)-SM rings and Q(0)-Mori rings.

Even when running under a reputation mechanism, such a node can still behave maliciously now and then so long as its reputation is within the acceptable level. To address this inconsistent behavior issue, a combined approach of statistic reputation and time series is proposed in this study, in which the negative binomial reputation is applied to rate the nodes' reputation and concept of time series is borrowed to analyze the reputation results. Simulations show that the proposed method can effectively counter inconsistent behavior nodes and thus improves the overall system performance.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure with the coexistence of the rhombohedral and tetragonal phase. The partial substitution of Dy3+ for Bi3+ enhanced effectively the piezoelectricity of the materials. The optimum piezoelectricity is obtained at x = 0.025, giving d(33) = 190 pC/N and k(P) = 37.2 %, respectively. After the addition of Dy3+, excellent photoluminescence of the ceramics is induced. The Dy-doped ceramics exhibit strong emissions at similar to 478 nm (blue) and similar to 575 nm (yellow), corresponding to F-4(9/2) -> H-6(15/2) and F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2) of Dy3+ transitions, respectively. The optimum photoluminescence of the ceramics is reached at x = 0.025. The ceramics with the doping of 2.5 mol% Dy3+ exhibit simultaneously good piezoelectricity, strong ferroelectricity and excellent photoluminescence, suggesting a promising application in the electro-optic devices.

By using elementary methods, we give two equivalent conditions of all even near-perfect numbers in the form 2 alpha p(1)p(2) and 2(alpha)p(1)(2)p(2), and obtain a lot of new near-perfect numbers which involve some special kinds of prime number pairs. One kind is exactly the new Mersenne conjecture's prime number pair. Another kind has the form p(1) = 2(alpha+1) - 1 and p(2) = p(2)(1)+p(1)+1/3, where the former is a Mersenne prime and the latter's behavior is very much like a Fermat number.

The complex dielectric permittivity of mixtures is well described by the Cole-Cole model. H-bonds strong effect for molecular interactions and the type of dipolar ordering that depends on the extent of substitution are estimated by the excess dielectric model, Bruggeman mixture formula model, Basey-Fisher model, and the Luzar model. A synthesis of four models reveals different aspects of the interaction of molecules, which can give us a deeper understanding of the relaxation processes.

Applying the semi-Markov process theory, the Cramer's rule and the Laplace (Laplace-Stieltjes) transform, several important performance measures including the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, the mean up time and the mean time between failures of the system are derived. Moreover, numerical inversion of Laplace transform is carried out to discuss the time-dependent behavior of system performance measures. In addition, a special case (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system is presented to verify the correctness of the analytical results.

A novel coordinative stochastic resonance (CSR) filtering method, which is described by an overdamped bistable dynamical system, is proposed to improve the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), which is defined to characterize CSR in optimal FrFT domain. Simulation results show that the output SINR is effectively improved by the use of CSR filter, which is based on the underlying mechanism that interfering LFM signals cooperate with noise in part to promote particles motion periodically with larger amplitude in a symmetric double well.

Correlation of grain size, phase transition and piezoelectric properties in Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							LEAD-FREE CERAMICS; BARIUM-TITANATE CERAMICS; SINTERING TEMPERATURE; FREE PIEZOCERAMICS; COEFFICIENT; BOUNDARY; MICROSTRUCTURE; TIME; MNO2	Pb-free ceramics Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 inspired by the excellent piezoelectricity of morphotropic phase boundary deriving from a tricritical point have been prepared by a solid state reaction route and the effects of grain size and room-temperature phases of the ceramics have been studied in detail. When sintering temperature rises from 1320 to 1560 degrees C with controlling the dwell time for 2 h, the ceramic sintered at 1480 degrees C possesses the optimum piezoelectricity. We choose 1360 and 1480 degrees C as two distinctive sintering temperatures to further study the effect of dwell time on the electrical properties of the ceramics. The results show that the improved piezoelectric behavior (d(33) similar to 416 pC/N and k(p) similar to 55.8 %) is demonstrated for the Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramic at an optimal sintering temperature of 1480 degrees C and dwell time of 2 h, which is attributed to the largest grain size together with more noticeable rhombohedral-tetragonal phase transition near room-temperature.

Five types of WB4 are considered i.e., orthorhombic Immm, Pnnm, Pmmn, monoclinic C2/m and hexagonal P6(3)/mmc structure. Our calculations indicate that the P6(3)/mmc-4u structure of WB4 is unstable at both ambient and pressure conditions, but the other four types of WB4 are stable, in agreement with recent theoretical results. By eliminating mechanical calculations, we find that the four types (C2/m, Immm, Pnnm and Pmmn) of WB4 are potential candidates to be ultra-incompressible and hard materials. Moreover, the WB4 in C2/m type is the most ultra-incompressible among the considered structures due to its superior mechanical properties, and the P6(3)/mmc-2u structure of WB4 is not considered to be hard material because of its low hardness. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio exhibits the positive pressure dependence, and four types show brittle nature within 100 GPa.

With careful characterization of crystal structures of the as-prepared products and the phase transition as a function of temperature, the phase diagram of (1 - x) BiFeO3-xLaMnO(3) solid solution has been determined. With the increasing of x value, the crystal structure of the samples transforms from rhombohedral R3c (x <= 0.13) to tetragonal P4mm (0.14 <= x <= 0.25), cubic Pm (3) over barm (0.26 <= x <= 0.78), and finally to rhombohedral R (3) over barc (0.80 <= x <= 1.00). In situ high temperature X-ray powder diffraction (HTXRD) studies reveal that the phase transformations of rhombohedral R3c to orthorhombic Pbnm and tetragonal P4mm to orthorhombic Pbnm occur at 600-750 degrees C and 580-700 degrees C, respectively. The phase structures of cubic Pm (3) over barm and rhombohedral R (3) over barc keep unchanged at temperature below 880 degrees C. However, a second-order-like phase transition was observed at higher temperature because of the change of thermo expansion coefficient. The complete phase diagram was then drawn based on those experimental results. It can be found clearly from the phase diagram that the as-prepared (1 - x)BiFeO3-xLaMnO(3) (x = 0-1) solid solutions provided more options to tune the magnetism and multiferroism, as the crystal structures possess polarity feature at a wide doping concentration of LaMnO3 (x <= 0.25). We then selectively studied the magnetic properties of possible multiferroic phases, i.e. R3c and P4mm phases. The results revealed that the magnetic property can be greatly enhanced when doping fraction of LaMnO3 is more than 0.08 (x > 0.08). (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Optical-absorption data show that the perfect-crystal results are similar to the predictions from the crystal-field theory: the pressure-induced spin transition of iron in ferropericlase causes a large blue-shift in its optical-absorption spectrum, leaving the near-infrared region transparent. However, when there are point defects in ferropericlase, the calculated optical-absorption results are completely inconsistent with predictions from the crystal-field theory, the spin transition causes the enhancement in the optical absorption in the near-infrared region. Refractive-index data of defect crystal indicate that the effects of pressure, wavenumber, and spin-transition on the high-pressure refractive-index of (Mg-0.97, Fe-0.03)O ferropericlase are obvious, but perfect-crystal results show that those effects should be relatively weak. The similar to 15%-20% iron-bearing ferropericlase is currently considered as an important mineral in the Earth's lower mantle. Due to similar characteristics of the observed high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum in ferropericlase with different iron content, we suggest that: (1) the above-mentioned calculated results is conducive to the understanding of high-pressure optical properties of lower-mantle ferropericlase and the exploring of the origin of discrepancies in its high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum between experiment and crystal-field theory; (2) the high-pressure optical-absorption spectrum measurements may be a good approach for probing iron spin state.

Here, we investigate the dynamics of a skyrmion driven by a spin wave in a magnetic nanowire. It is found that (i) the skyrmion is first accelerated and then decelerated exponentially; (ii) it can turn L-corners with both right and left turns; and (iii) it always turns left (right) when the skyrmion number is positive (negative) in the T-and Y-junctions. Our results will be the basis of skyrmionic devices driven by a spin wave.

The effects of the nonlinear media on the entanglement have been analyzed. It is shown that the Kerr nonlinear medium makes the perfect entanglement in some discrete frequency regions. Furthermore, when the input vacuum field is squeezed, the frequency range for producing the entanglement can be effectively extended and the reachable maximal entanglement can be enhanced by the Kerr nonlinear medium, while the OPA medium reduces the degree of the entanglement and necks the frequency range for generating the entanglement. These results suggest that nonlinear media could serve as a new handle to coherently control the entanglement between the vibrational modes of the micromirrors in the optomechanical cavity system.

As a "smart" ecosystem, smart cities focus on sustainable growth, efficiency, productivity and environmentally friendly development. By comparing with the European Union, North America and other countries, smart cities in China are still in the preliminary stage. This study offers a comparative analysis of ten smart cities in China on the basis of an extensive database covering two time periods: 2005-2007 and 2008-2010. The unsupervised computational neural network self-organizing map (SOM) analysis is adopted to map out the various cities based on their performance. The demonstration effect and mutual influences between these ten smart cities are also discussed by using social network analysis. Based on the smart city performance and cluster network, current problems for smart city development in China were pointed out. Future research directions for smart city research are discussed at the end this paper.

The ceramics possess a single phase perovskite structure. The grain growth of the ceramics is prohibited and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at T-C becomes more diffusive after the addition of Dy2O3. Dy2O3 doping improves the piezoelectricity of the ceramics and the optimal piezoelectric properties d(33) = 335 pC/N is obtained at x = 0.5. The addition of 2 mol% Dy enhances the photoluminescent properties of the ceramics and strong emissions at similar to 478 nm and similar to 575 nm are observed. Our study shows that the ceramics with low Dy2O3 levels exhibit simultaneously the strong piezoelectricity, ferroelectricity and photoluminescence and may have a potential application in mechano-electro-optic integration and coupling device.

High power density NaNbO3-LiTaO3 lead-free piezoelectric transformer in radial vibration modes	SMART MATERIALS AND STRUCTURES			English	Article						NN-based; ceramic; transformer; lead-free; disk-shaped; high power density	GRAIN-GROWTH; SINTERING TEMPERATURE; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; FREE CERAMICS; MICROSTRUCTURE; LIQUID	In the present work, the sintering temperature was able to substantially influence the microstructure and electrical properties of the lead-free ceramic 0.88NaNbO(3)-0.12LiTaO(3). This composition without any acceptor doping presents a high mechanical quality factor, Q(m), value of 1469 and a high Curie temperature of 305 degrees C by optimizing the sintering temperature at 1330 degrees C. We applied this material to make a device of disk-shaped piezoelectric transformers with a ring-dot structure and further focused on investigating the characteristics of the piezoelectric transformers. With matching load, a maximum efficiency of 92% occurs in the fundamental mode, and the maximum voltage gains are 5.5 and 3.7 for the fundamental and third radial vibration modes, respectively. The experimental results show a maximum output power of 10.5 W with a temperature rise of 27 degrees C. It is noteworthy that a high output power density (as high as 32.8 W cm(-3)) was obtained under a maximum input voltage of 180 V, which is comparable to the performance of PZT in a piezoelectric ceramic transformer device.

The objective power system problems to be solved, e.g., power and load fluctuations, are transformed into equivalent energy exchange demanding values for the superconducting coil used in a superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) device. With the model, the buffering effects for the external power and load fluctuations and the superconducting properties of the superconducting coil itself can be obtained equivalently for optimizing and evaluating the designed SMES device. Four coil-current-dependent formulas are derived to estimate the hysteresis loss, coupling current loss, eddy current loss, and flux flow loss of the superconducting coil under different energy exchange operation conditions. A case study has been carried out using a Bi-2223 coil. The obtained results verify the effectiveness of the SMEE model and its feasibility for practical applications.

J	Wang, FG; Kim, H				Wang, Fanggui; Kim, Hwankoo			Two generalizations of projective modules and their applications	JOURNAL OF PURE AND APPLIED ALGEBRA			English	Article							INJECTIVE-MODULES; INTEGRAL-DOMAINS; W-MODULES; RING; IDEAL	Let R be a commutative ring, M be an R-module, and w be the so-called w-operation on R. Set G(w) = {f is an element of R[X] vertical bar c(f)(w) = R}, where c(f) denotes the content of f. Let R{X} = R[X]G(w) and M{X} = M[X]G(w) be the w-Nagata ring of R and the w-Nagata module of M respectively. Then we introduce and study two concepts of w-projective modules and w-invertible modules, which both generalize projective modules. To do so, we use two main methods of which one is to localize at maximal w-ideals of R and the other is to utilize w-Nagata modules over w-Nagata rings. In particular, it is shown that an R-module M is w-projective of finite type if and only if M{X} is finitely generated projective over R{X}; M is w-invertible if and only if M{X} is invertible over R{X}. As applications, it is shown that R is semisimple if and only if every R-module is w-projective and that, in a Q(0)-PVMR, every finite type semi-regular module is w-projective. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The role of the unusually ordered hydrogen ions are carefully analyzed. The hydrogen ions break the crystal symmetry to change the degeneracy of the V t(2g) orbit, thus inducing magnetic transitions from the paramagnetism of parent oxides to the antiferromagnetism of oxyhydride. The low dimension behaviors would been expected because of the nonbonding nature between the V t(2g) and H s orbitals due to symmetry. Moreover, our results indicate that the direct hoppings of the nearest neighboring two V t(2g) orbitals and the indirect hoppings mediated by Sr ions should be essential to understanding the electronic and magnetic properties of the perovskite oxyhydride.

Structural, elastic, and thermodynamic properties of hexagonal molybdenum nitrides under high pressure from first principles	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Elastic constants; Debye temperature; Expansion coefficients; delta-MoN	TRANSITION-METAL NITRIDES; HIGH-TEMPERATURE; DELTA-MON; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURES; CONSTANTS; CRYSTALS; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; NITRIDATION; STABILITY; HARDNESS	The structural and elastic properties of hexagonal molybdenum nitrides (delta-MoN) at high pressure were investigated through the first-principles calculation using local density approximation and generalized gradient approximation within the plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. The obtained equilibrium structure and mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical results. Then we compared the elastic modulus of delta-MoN. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that delta-MoN is stable in our calculations (0-100 GPa). The calculated B/G ratios indicate that delta(1)-MoN (space group of P-6m2, No. 187) possesses brittle nature within 100 GPa, but delta(3)-MoN (space group of P63mc, No. 186) possesses brittle nature below 46.7 GPa and it begins to prone to ductility when the pressure increases to 46.7 GPa. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of delta-MoN. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Liu, K.; Dong, B.; Zhou, X.

J	Wu, SQ; Fang, DK; Zhao, GP				Wu Shao-Quan; Fang Dong-Kai; Zhao Guo-Ping			Effect of electronic correlations on magnetotransport through a parallel double quantum dot	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						parallel double quantum dot; electronic correlations; master equation method; negative differential conductance and negative tunnel magetoresistance	SCATTERING-THEORY; KONDO; CONDUCTORS; NOISE	We theoretically investigate the effects of electronic correlations (including spin and Coulomb correlations) on the magnetotransport through a parallel double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to ferromagnetic leads. Two dots couple coherently through electron correlations, rather than tunneling directly between two dots, and each dot is coupled to two semi-infinite ferromagnetic leads. We assume that the intradot Coulomb repulsion is much larger than the interdot Coulomb repulsion U. Thus, only the zero, one and two-particle DQD states are relevant to transport. Because of interdot electron correlation, the I-V characteristics of each dot is sensitive to the change in the state of the other dot. This work focuses on the effects of electron spin correlation and electron Coulomb correlation on magnetotransport through this system. In order to determine the transport properties of the system, we use the generalized master equation method. This method is based on the reduced density operator defined by averaging the statistical operator of the total system over the states of all leads. With the framework of the generalized master equation and the sequential tunneling approximation, we calculate the current, differential conductance and tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) in the dot 1 as a function of bias for different spin correlations and Coulomb correlations. Our results reveal that the magnetotransport through this system is more sensitive to Coulomb correlation than to spin correlation; when Coulomb correlation equals zero, the spin correlation can induce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance, which is further larger than the Julliere's value of TMR; when Coulomb correlation occurs, the giant tunnel magnetoresistance disappears; when Coulomb correlation is equal to or larger than spin correlation, Coulomb correlation can suppress spin correlation; while the coexistence of Coulomb correlation and asymmetry of the DQD system can result in dynamical channel blockade, which can lead to the occurrence of negative tunnel magetoresistance and negative differential conductance. These novel properties lead to the potential applications in nanoelectronics, and relevant underlying physics of this problem is discussed.

All the reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were optimized with B3LYP method at 6-311+G (d, p) basis set (the LanL2DZ basis set was used for Ag atom). Transition states and intermediates have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate (IRC). In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. Consistent with the conclusions reported in the literature, the core of obtaining the production of azobenzene according to the coupling reaction of PATP absorbed on Ag-5 clusters is the elimination of two H atoms. Meanwhile, we find that the effect of illumination in that reaction matters a lot. We also found in PATP molecular that the synergistic catalytic effect of S end absorbed on the catalyzer draws dramatically evident under no illumination conditions, while it draws less obvious under light. According to the paper's conclusion, PATP absorbed on the surface of Ag-5 tends to generate azobenzene easily.

Although temporal adjustment of multiple audiovisual stimuli has been recently demonstrated to be spatially specific, perceptual grouping processes that organize separate audiovisual stimuli into distinctive "objects" may play a more important role in forming the basis for subsequent multiple temporal recalibrations. We investigated whether apparent physical differences between audiovisual pairs that make them distinct from each other can independently drive multiple concurrent temporal recalibrations regardless of spatial overlap. Experiment 1 verified that reducing the physical difference between two audiovisual pairs diminishes the multiple temporal recalibrations by exposing observers to two utterances with opposing temporal relationships spoken by one single speaker rather than two distinct speakers at the same location. Experiment 2 found that increasing the physical difference between two stimuli pairs can promote multiple temporal recalibrations by complicating their non-temporal dimensions (e.g., disks composed of two rather than one attribute and tones generated by multiplying two frequencies); however, these recalibration aftereffects were subtle. Experiment 3 further revealed that making the two audiovisual pairs differ in temporal structures (one transient and one gradual) was sufficient to drive concurrent temporal recalibration. These results confirm that the more audiovisual pairs physically differ, especially in temporal profile, the more likely multiple temporal perception adjustments will be content-constrained regardless of spatial overlap. These results indicate that multiple temporal recalibrations are based secondarily on the outcome of perceptual grouping processes.

Excluding the five species, three cryptic species (U. sp. 1, U. sp. 2 and U. sp. 3) and two putative species, U.nivatus and U.atronates, are recognized. The phylogenetic relationships among the species remain unclear and these preclude investigations of their potential adaptations for living in high altitudes. We sequenced the complete mitochondrial DNA genomes of three species of Asiatic shrewlike moles (U.aequodonenia, U.andersoni and U.nivatus). Phylogenetic analyses of 16 published and our de novo mitogenomes yield single, robust trees with the relationships being (U.soricipes (U. sp. 1 (U.nivatus (U.andersoni, U.aequodonenia)))). Further, the tree verifies the validity of recently described U.aequodonenia. Analyses of selection pressure suggest that the 13 mtDNA-encoding genes of species in the genus Uropsilus all have experienced strong purifying selection, although ATP8 accumulated a higher ratio of non-synonymous substitutions than the other loci, which might reflect adaptation of the genus Uropsilus to different environments/elevations.

By means of the slave-boson mean-held approximation, we calculate the linear conductance and the transmission in the Rondo regime at zero temperature. The obtained results show that both the linear conductance and transmission probability are quite sensitive to the spin-flip strength when the DQD structure is changed among the serial, parallel and T-shaped. It is suggested that such a theoretical model can be used to study the physical phenomenon related to the spin manipulation transport. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Li, QG; Xu, K; Rei, Y				Li, Qiang-Gen; Xu, Ke; Rei, Yi			Origin of Enhanced Reactivity of a Microsolvated Nucleophile in Ion Pair S(N)2 Reactions: The Cases of Sodium p-Nitrophenoxide with Halomethanes in Acetone	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY A			English	Article							TRANSITION-STATE STRUCTURE; GAS-PHASE; SUBSTITUTION REACTIONS; LEAVING-GROUP; METHYL HALIDES; LITHIUM HALIDE; PROTIC SOLVENT; LEVEL; RETENTION; SOLVATION	In a kinetic experiment on the S(N)2 reaction of sodium p-nitrophenoxide with iodomethane in acetone-water mixed solvent, Humeres et al (J. Org. Chem. 2001, 66, 1163) found that the reaction depends strongly on the medium; and the fastest rate constant was observed in pure acetone. The present work tries to explore why acetone can enhance the reactivity of the title reactions. Accordingly we make a mechanistic study on the reactions of sodium p-nitrophenoxide with halomethanes (CH3X, X = Cl, Br, I) in acetone by using a supramolecular/continuum model at the PCM-MP2/6-311+G(d,p)//B3LYP/6-311-04+G(d,p) level, in which the ion pair nucleophile is microsolvated by one to three acetone molecules. We compared the reactivity of the microsolvated ion pair nucleophiles with solvent-free ion pair and anionic ones Our results clearly reveal that the microsolvated ion pair nucleophile is favorable for the S(N)2 reactions; meanwhile, the origin of the enhanced reactivity induced by microsolvation of the nucleophile is discussed in terms of the geometries of transition state (TS) structures and activation Strain model, suggesting that lower deformation energies and stronger interaction energies between the deformed reactants in the TS lead to the lower overall reaction barriers for the S(N)2 reaction of microsolvated sodium p-nitrophenoxide toward halomethanes in acetone.

Using a full quantum theory of photon transport in real space, it is shown that the Rabi splittings of the photonic transmission spectra can be controlled by the cavity-mirror couplings; the splittings could still be observed even when the cavity-atom system works in the weak coupling regime, and the transmission probability of the resonant photon can be modulated from 0 to 100%. Additionally, our numerical results show that the appearance of Fano resonance is related to the strengths of the cavity-mirror coupling and the dissipations of the system. An experimental demonstration of the proposal with the current photonic crystal waveguide technique is suggested.

However, little is known about the influence of individual alerting efficiency on perceived duration. In this study, we explored this question by running two experiments. The Attentional Networks Test was used to evaluate individual differences in alerting efficiency in each experiment. Temporal bisection (Experiment 1) and time generalization task (Experiment 2) were used to explore the participants' perception of duration. The results indicated that subjects in the high alerting efficiency group overestimated interval durations and estimated durations more accurately compared with subjects in the low alerting efficiency group. The two experiments showed that the sensitivity of time was not influenced by individual alerting efficiency. Based on previous studies and current findings, we infer that individual differences in alerting efficiency may influence time perception through modulating the latency of the attention controlled switch and the speed of the peacemaker within the framework of the internal clock model.

The S-ONUs are primarily selected to communicate with the M-ONU and, second, with the remote node (RN), which can reduce the usage of high-power ports at the RN and subsequently decrease energy consumption. It is demonstrated that obvious energy-saving effects can be achieved, and moreover, the energy-saving efficiency can be further improved by expanding the capacity of the links between RN and M-ONUs and properly selecting the scale of the ONU group.

Our result shows that the value of the solution can be determined uniquely by means of its value on an arbitrary open subdomain of G at any given positive time constant. Further, when G is convex and bounded, we also give a quantitative version of the unique continuation property.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			An expanded double-quantitative model regarding probabilities and grades and its hierarchical double-quantitative attribute reduction	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Decision-theoretic rough set; Graded rough set; Double quantification; Granular computing; Attribute reduction	PRECISION ROUGH SET; CLASSIFICATION	Probabilities and grades serve as relative and absolute measures, respectively. They are used to establish the decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) and graded rough set (GRS) two basic quantitative models. The double-quantification of probabilities and grades exhibits systematicness and completeness in view of the two-dimensional feature of the approximate space; however, double-quantitative construction becomes a problem, and double-quantitative reduction is rarely reported. Thus, this paper mainly constructs an expanded double-quantitative model by logically integrating probabilities and grades; it further studies relevant double-quantitative reduction by hierarchically preserving specific regions. (1) First, a novel model is established via the logic integration and expansion requirement, and its regional system and granular hierarchy are studied via granular computing. Thus, regional semantics is extracted via basic semantics granules. Regional calculation is realized by two algorithms, and the algorithm regarding calculation granules exhibits optimization according to algorithm analyses. (2) Second, three types of model-regional preservation reducts and their hierarchy are discussed in the two-category case. Thus, SRP-Reduct, CRP-Reduct, and APP-Reduct are studied by exploring four-region preservation properties, constructing two-region classification regions, and preserving four original approximations, respectively. Furthermore, a relevant reduction hierarchy is thoroughly achieved. (3) Moreover, the model and its reduction are illustrated by two examples of decision tables. The constructional model conducts double-quantification regarding probabilities and grades; thus, it exhibits double-quantitative semantics and benignly expands DTRS-Model, GRS-Model, and Pawlak-Model. Furthermore, its hierarchical reduction reflects some double-quantitative reduction essence; thus, its reduction expands qualitative Pawlak-Reduction while guides quantitative DTRS-Reduction and GRS-Reduction.

These hybrid composites models were characterized by mean square displacement, radial distribution function, temperature-volume behavior and Xray diffraction at molecular level. The result shows: as TSP-PUSS loading is lower than 12. 11 wt%, the mobility of the polymer chains is enhanced apparently due to the humping open cage structure of TSP-PUSS which increases the average distance between the polymer chains; as TSP-PUSS loading is higher than 12. 11 wt%, TSP-POSS self-reunites and crystalline clusters are formed which lead to restricting the motion of the polymer chains. According to temperature-volume behavior analysis, the introduction of TSP-PUSS can significantly increase the glass transition temperature of polyurethane hybrid composites and thus, the introduction of TSP-PUSS is supposed to improve the hybrid composite' s thermal stability with reasonable concentration in application.

In fact, we will investigate the effect of the magnetic field term on the equations. By using variational calculus, we obtain the threshold of global existence and blowup of the solution to the equations, which will be more complicated and requires more skill.

An R-module M is called a w-Noetherian module if every submodule of M is of w-finite type. R is called a w-Noetherian ring if R as an R-module is a w-Noetherian module. In this paper, we present an exact version of the Eakin-Nagata Theorem on w-Noetherian rings. To do this, we prove the Formanek Theorem for w-Noetherian rings. Further, we point out by an example that the condition (dagger) in the Chung-Ha-Kim version of the Eakin-Nagata Theorem on SM domains is essential.

INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES			English	Article							ANTIBACTERIAL PROPERTIES; ANTIOXIDANT ACTIVITIES; ESSENTIAL OILS; FRUIT JUICES; IN-VITRO; PLANTS	Urena lobata has been used as a traditional medicinal plant in India and China. In this study, we investigated the antimicrobial activity and isolated the active compound from the leaves of U. lobata. The 80% ethanol extract from U. lobata leaves showed an effective anti-yeast activity against Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) strains. Using a combination of chromatographic methods, (-)-trachelogenin (1) and clematoside-S (2) were isolated from this plant for the first time, and their chemical structure was identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and extensive nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data analysis. In addition, 1 was found to be inactive against all of the test microorganisms in the antimicrobial assay, whereas 2 exhibits a specific anti-yeast activity against S. cerevisiae strains with diameter of inhibition zones in the range from 11 to 20 mm. Furthermore, the MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MBC (minimum bactericidal concentration) values of 2 against S. cerevisiae strains were detected to be in the ranges of 0.61 to 9.8 mu g/mL and 2.42 to 9.8 mu g/mL, respectively. This is the first report of 2 with a specific anti-yeast activity. The above result suggests the potential application of U. lobata to be used as a natural anti-yeast agent in food preservation.

However, the way topography shapes genetic structures and demographic histories of endemic species has not been well studied. We examined the phylogeo-graphic pattern and demographic histories of Sorex bedfordiae, a dispersal-limited small mammal, using three nuclear genes [1977 bp] and two mitochondrial genes [1794 bp] with comprehensive molecular approaches. We recovered five well-supported clades whose distributions are along mountain ridges and roughly subdivided by large rivers. Demographic expansions in the middle Pleistocene were strongly supported by both nuclear and mitochondrial genes. Our results support the hypothesis that sky island topography and river systems strongly affect the genetic structure of non-aquatic terrestrial species. We further clarify that S. bedfordiae and S. cylindricauda are valid sibling species, whereas S. excelsus is most likely a geographic subspecies of S. bedfordiae. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

The effects of Al doping and sintering temperature on microstructure, piezoelectricity and magnetism of the ceramics were studied. The crystalline structures of BFO-BT-BA-x ceramics sintered at 970 degrees C for 2 h evolve from rhombohedral structure at x = 0 to the coexistence of rhombohedral structure and orthorhombic phases at x = 0.01-0.03 and finally to orthorhombic phases at x> 0.03. The critical sintering temperature is 970 degrees C. For the ceramics with x = 0.01 sintered at/above 970 degrees C, large grains, good densification, high resistivity, and enhanced ferromagnetic properties are obtained. The ceramic with x = 0.01 sintered at 970 8C possesses high resistivity (similar to 10(9) Omega cm) and good piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 138 pCN(-1), k(p) = 32.7%). Al doping decreases the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics, while the increase in the sintering temperature enhances the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics.

Hysteresis Loops, Critical Fields and Energy Products for Exchange-spring Hard/soft/hard Trilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETICS			English	Article						hard/soft trilayers; hysteresis loops; energy products; micromagnetic calculation	MAGNETS; NUCLEATION; COERCIVITY; FILMS	Macroscopic hysteresis loops and microscopic magnetic moment distributions have been determined by a three-dimensional (3D) model for exchange-coupled Sm-Co/alpha-Fe/Sm-Co trilayers with in-plane collinear easy axes. These results are carefully compared with the popular one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic models and recent experimental data. It is found that the results obtained from the two methods match very well, especially for the remanence and coercivity, justifying the calculations. Both nucleation and coercive fields decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-S increases while the largest maximum energy product (roughly 50 MGOe) occurs when the thicknesses of hard and soft layers are 5 nm and 15 nm, respectively. Moreover, the calculated angular distributions in the thickness direction for the magnetic moments are similar. Nevertheless, the calculated nucleation and pinning fields as well as the energy products by 3D OOMMF are systematically smaller than those given by the 1D model, due mainly to the stray fields at the corners of the films. These demagnetization fields help the magnetic moments at the corners to deviate from the previous saturation state and facilitate the nucleation. Such an effect enhances as LS increases. When the thicknesses of hard and soft layers are 10 nm and 20 nm, respectively, the pinning field difference is as large as 30%, while the nucleation fields have opposite signs,	[Chen, B.

We derive a condition for boundary layer separation, and the condition is determined by initial values and external forces. More importantly, the condition can predict when and where the boundary layer separation occurs directly. In addition, we also get an algebraic equation for the separation point and the separation time. The algebraic equation can tell us where the boundary layer separation does not occur in a short period of time. The main technical tool is the geometric theory of incompressible flows developed by T. Ma and S. Wang in [15].

The configurations of the best sites, the adsorption energies in the best sites and the electronic structures of stable adsorption models, including DOS, PDOS, electron density map, mulliken charge properties of DNA bases and B atom before and after adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs have been investigated. And the frontier orbital energy gap and charge transfer of DNA bases adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs have been also investigated. The results indicated that the best adsorption site of DNA base adsorption on pristine and B-doped SWCNTs was on the top of carbon and B atoms. The bases A, G were adsorbed on pure SWCNT by weak interaction, the bases T, C were adsorbed on pure SWCNT by strong chemical interaction. The bases A, T, C, G were adsorbed on B-doped SWCNT by chemical interaction. After B doping, the structure of the SWCNT was not distorted, however, the local electronic structure was modified. The frontier orbital energy gap of SWCNT could be effectively reduced by B doping. Moreover, the electronic reactivity with the DNA bases of SWCNT were enhanced by B doping. The DNA bases on the surface of B-doped SWCNT could be modified by Chemical adsorption. This method for the modification of DNA bases on B-doped SWCNT surface has great potential for the construction of DNA bio-sensors of biorecognition interfaces.

In this work we theoretically investigate and predict that superlattices comprised of MoS2 and WSe2 multilayers possess continuously tunable electronic structure with direct bandgaps. The tunability is controlled by the thickness ratio of MoS2 versus WSe2 of the superlattice. When this ratio goes from 152 to 551, the dominant K-K direct bandgap is continuously tuned from 0.14 eV to 0.5 eV. The gap stays direct against -0.6% to 2% in-layer strain and up to -4.3% normal-layer compressive strain. The valance and conduction bands are spatially separated. These robust properties suggest that MoS2 and WSe2 multilayer superlattice should be a promising material for infrared optoelectronics.

The magnetic hyperthermia properties of the nanodisc and isotropic nanoparticles are investigated systematically. The results suggest that the nanodisc shows much higher specific absorption rate (SAR) than isotropic nanoparticles. This is attributed to the parallel alignment of nanodisc with respect to the alternating current magnetic field, which is confirmed by good agreement between experimental results and micromagnetic simulation. It is found that such parallel alignment could enhance the SAR value by a factor of approximate to 2 with respect to the randomly oriented case. The above results indicate that the nanodisc provides an excellent thermal seed for magnetic hyperthermia. This study sheds the light on the magnetic hyperthermia mechanism of magnetic nanodisc and it also opens the window to explore high efficiency thermal seeds by controlling the orientation of magnetic nanostructures.

In this paper, a new heating model of multiple tube structure is proposed and the relevant simulations and experiments of heating water were performed based on the computational platform COMSOL Multi-physics software in order to achieve the better temperature uniformity and heating efficiency. Besides, the influence of the instability of microwave ovens on the heating performances of the optimal heating models was analyzed. The simulation results show that the heating uniformity and efficiency of water in optimal six tube structure increased by 7.1% and 68.5% (30 mL), 9.2% and 61% (60 mL) respectively compared with the optimal single tube structure. Moreover, the heating performances of the optimal heating models do not change obviously, while the working frequency and power change slightly. The simulation results are in good agreement with the experiment data.

NBO analysis was applied to investigate the atomic natural charge and stabilization interaction energies among molecules. The results showed that the reaction initially proceeds through the loss of the linearity of the azido group and the approaching of the terminal nitrogen atom of the azide group to the nitrogen atom of the ring. This is followed by an attack of the lone pairs on N atoms in the ring to the azido group, leading to the formation of the N-N bonds. Many factors, including bending of the bond angle, electrostatic attraction, orbital delocalization and the stabilization interaction give rise to a large free energy barrier for the cyclization process. The results also show that the second and third cyclization is relatively easier than the first one.

All the ceramics possess perovskite structure and exhibit good insulation and densification. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x = 0.02. As the concentration of La3+ is increased, the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition of the ceramics at Curie temperature becomes gradually more diffusive. A small amount of the substitution of La3+ for Bi3+ improves effectively the ferroelectricity of the ceramics and the optimum remanent polarization of 27.2 mu m/cm(2) reaches at x = 0.04. After the addition of La3+, the ferromagnetism of the ceramics is greatly enhanced and the remanent magnetization M-r monotonously increases from 0.0321 to 0.147 emu/g with x increasing from 0 to 0.10. Our results show that the ceramics possess simultaneously improved ferroelectric and ferromagnetic properties and may a promising candidate for room-temperature multiferroic materials.

In contrast to the majority of Internet worms, it is by exploiting users' legitimate activities instead of vulnerabilities of networks in which P2P passive worms propagate. This feature evidently slows down their propagation, which results in them not attracting an adequate amount of attention in literature. Meanwhile, this feature visibly increases the difficulty of detecting them, which makes it very possible for them to become epidemic. In this paper, we propose an analytical model for P2P passive worm propagation by adopting epidemiological approaches so as to identify their behaviors and predict the tendency of their propagation accurately. Compared with a few existing models, dynamic characteristics of P2P networks are taken into account. Based on this proposed model, the sufficient condition for the global stability of the worm free equilibrium is derived by applying epidemiological theories. Large scale simulation experiments have validated both the proposed model and the condition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The system behavior is well described according to four Cole-Cole (CC) terms whose evolution with composition is analyzed. Applying the extended Froehlich theory, we reveal the dual nature of water-ion and water-dipole interaction and propose an overview of the effects that water-ion interaction plays a dominating role in the aqueous LiOH solution system. With the theoretical framework 3D trajectory model, we find only about one H-bonded water cluster relaxes during the cutoff relaxation time interval 8.9 ps.

It is shown that the normalized far-zone scattered spectral density produced by a Gaussian-centered deterministic medium and by a Gaussian-correlated quasi-homogeneous random medium will be identical provided that the square of the effective width of normalized correlation coefficient of the quasi-homogeneous random medium is twice the square of the effective width of scattering potential of the determinate medium.

This chart is an adaptive one and has a variable sampling interval, which makes it more efficient. Further, it is a self-starting scheme and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages. The choice of the chart parameters is studied, and a simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also efficiently detects various magnitudes of shifts.

The fluorescence of BSA-AuNCs was found to be quenched effectively by the free chlorine, and the decrease in fluorescence intensity of BSA-AuNCs allowed the sensitive detection of free chlorine in the range of 0.8-800 mu M. The detection limit is 0.50 mu M at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The present fluorescent assay for free chlorine possesses low detection limit, wide linear range and good selectivity. Real tap water samples were analyzed with satisfactory results, which suggested its potential for water quality analysis. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

JOURNAL OF MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Boundedness; Global smoothness; Iterative root; Oscillation	EQUATION	A crisis in the smoothness of iterative roots appears at fixed points. The local C-r smoothness of iterative roots near a hyperbolic fixed point is well known, but its global C-r extension to both fixed points is generically impossible because of their violent oscillation near the next hyperbolic fixed point. In this study, we consider how violently these smooth iterative roots oscillate. We prove that their first order derivatives are bounded but their r-th (r >= 2) order derivatives are generically unbounded. In addition, we prove that the global C-1 smoothness is of vital significance for the global higher order derivatives. As a corollary, we show that iterative roots on the maximal interval oscillate with C-1 boundedness but C-r (r >= 2) unboundedness. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals manifests as a charge imbalance between the Weyl nodes of opposite chiralities induced by parallel electric and magnetic fields. We investigate the chiral anomaly effect on the plasmon mode in both intrinsic and dopedWeyl semimetals within the random phase approximation. We prove that the chiral anomaly gives rise to a different plasmon mode in intrinsic Weyl semimetals. We also find the chiral anomaly leads to some exotic properties in the plasmon dispersion in doped Weyl semimetals. Consequently, the unconventional plasmon mode acts as a signature of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals, by which the spectrum of plasmon provides a proper way to detect the Lifshitz transition.

Skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-edge repulsions in skyrmion-based racetrack memory	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							DOMAIN-WALLS; MOTION; DYNAMICS; LATTICE; MNSI; TORQUES; STATE	Magnetic skyrmions are promising for building next-generation magnetic memories and spintronic devices due to their stability, small size and the extremely low currents needed to move them. In particular, skyrmion-based racetrack memory is attractive for information technology, where skyrmions are used to store information as data bits instead of traditional domain walls. Here we numerically demonstrate the impacts of skyrmion-skyrmion and skyrmion-edge repulsions on the feasibility of skyrmion-based racetrack memory. The reliable and practicable spacing between consecutive skyrmionic bits on the racetrack as well as the ability to adjust it are investigated. Clogging of skyrmionic bits is found at the end of the racetrack, leading to the reduction of skyrmion size. Further, we demonstrate an effective and simple method to avoid the clogging of skyrmionic bits, which ensures the elimination of skyrmionic bits beyond the reading element. Our results give guidance for the design and development of future skyrmion-based racetrack memory.	[Zhang, Xichao; Zhao, G. P.; Xia, J.; Morvan, F.

In addition, the effects of insulation location and life-cycle cost analysis (LCC) model on optimum insulation thickness are also investigated. The research is performed for four cities in hot summer and cold winter zone in China. Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) is selected as the insulation material. A FORTRAN code developed by an implicit finite difference method is applied to calculate yearly cooling and heating transmission loads. A LCC method, which is according with the reality, is applied to determine optimum insulation thickness. Results show that insulation location almost has no effect on total yearly transmission load while natural ventilation plays a significant role in reducing the yearly cooling transmission load for all orientation walls. Moreover, it is found that natural ventilation results in obvious decrease of optimum insulation thickness and different LCC models lead to significant distinction in optimum insulation thickness. Research indicates that the effect of orientation on optimum insulation thickness cannot be ignored. At last, a sensitivity analysis on optimum insulation thickness is carried out and the results show that insulation price is the most sensitive factor.

It was found that among the three polysaccharides, Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) exhibits the best scavenging activity. Polysaccharide loaded collagen membranes were prepared by mixing LBP with collagen, starch, glycerol, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose and glutaraldehyde. In vitro drug release from membranes was evaluated. With increasing the immersion time, the release rate first increases and then slows down. Meanwhile, the scavenging activity to DPPH radicals exhibits similar variation, in agreement with a good release effect of the membrane. The optimal formulation of collagen membrane and preparation parameters were obtained considering the overall properties and the scavenging activity to radicals.

The evolutionary mechanisms of the micro-topography and microstructure of the samples have been proposed, and the fluorescence and decay properties of the samples have been investigated. It was found that the fluorescence intensity of the sample has been greatly enhanced after addition of an opportune amount of Bi3+. The optimum concentrations of Eu3+ and Bi3+ for fluorescence are x = 0.125 and y = 0.5%, respectively. The significant enhancement in fluorescence performance could be obtained in the sample with the desired morphology at the optimum volume of HNO3 (V-HNO3 = 11 mL).

Using supplementary variable technique and embedded Markov chain method, the queue-length distribution solution in the form of formula at arbitrary epoch is obtained. Some performance measures associated with operating cost are also discussed based on the obtained queue-length distribution. Then, several numerical experiments follow to demonstrate the effectiveness of the obtained formulae. Finally, a state-dependent operating cost function is constructed to model an express logistics service center. Regarding the service rate during working vacation as a control variable, the optimization analysis on the cost function is carried out by using parabolic method.

Photophysical and magneto-electroluminescence (MEL) characterization results revealed that NA-TNA could harvest triplet excitons via a triplet-triplet annihilation (TTA) process in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to the presence of a lower-lying triplet excited state with (3)pi pi* character. Consequently, using NA-TNA as a guest compound and CzPhONI, another ICT-featured naphthalimide derivative with triplet fusion delayed fluorescence (TFDF) character as host material, a high-performance orange OLED with 6 wt% NA-TNA doped CzPhONI film as the emitting layer was acquired. The maximum current efficiency (LEmax), brightness (L-max), and external quantum yield (EQE(max)) of this OLED is 7.73 cd A(-1), 31940 cd m(-2) and 5.83%, respectively, while the theoretical EQE(max) of this device should not exceed 3.34%. On the contrary, the reference device with a NA-TNA doping level of 1.4 wt% showed much inferior performance, with a LEmax, a L-max, and an EQE(max) of 3.19 cd A(-1), 24 900 cd m(-2) and 2.49%, respectively. The high performance of the 6 wt% NA-TNA doped device was attributed to the efficient harvesting of triplet excitons by both the guest and host materials.

A left R-module M (resp., right R-module N) is called weak injective (resp., weak flat) if Ext(R)(1) (F,M) = 0 (resp., Tor(1)(R) (N,F) = 0) for every super finitely presented left R-module F. By replacing finitely presented modules by super finitely presented modules, we may generalize many results of a homological nature from coherent rings to arbitrary rings. Some examples are given to show that weak injective (resp., weak flat) modules need not be FP-injective (resp., not flat) in general. In addition, we introduce and study the super finitely presented dimension (denote by l.sp.gldim(R)) of R that are defined in terms of only super finitely presented left R-modules.

It is shown that, when the collection is illuminated with two correlated light waves, the far-zone scattered spectrum may be shifted to a longer or a smaller wavelength, depending on the angle of scattering. It is also shown that the magnitude of the spectral shift is affected by the properties of the pair-structure factor, including the angular width and the angular correlation width. This phenomenon may have potential applications in the determination of the structure information from the measurements of the scattered field. (C) 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

When there is no failed component in the system, the repairmen leave for a vacation, the duration of which follows a phase type distribution. Upon returning from vacation, they should take another vacation if there are less than.. failed components waiting in the system. This pattern continues until at least.. failed components are waiting. Moreover, the redundant dependency which is a special kind of failure dependency is taken into account in the multicomponent system. Under such assumptions, the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the reliability of the system are derived in transient regime by applying the quasi-birth-and-death process. Furthermore, the Runge-Kutta method is carried out to numerically discuss the time-dependent behavior of the system reliability measures. Finally, a special case of the system is presented to show the validity of our model.

The dispersion state of GO and the mechanical properties of the nanocomposites were studied. It was found that a uniform dispersion of GO in the NR matrix was achieved with the latex mixing method. The well-distributed GO was remarkably effective in improving the tensile strength and storage modulus of NR at very low filler contents, without sacrificing the ultimate strength.

The results showed that the perylene and its four derivatives belonged to the semiconductor molecules, which released energy when electron was injected. Therefore, they were suitable to be used as the electron injection material. The introduction of OH group can improve the electron transfer rate significantly. The formations of intramolecular hydrogen bonds were unfavorable to the hole transfer, but conducive to the electron transfer. The perylene derivatives, 2,5-3,4,5-(trifluorophenyl)ethynyl-8,11-3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylethynyl, designed in this article had the hole transfer rate of 1.57 cm(2)/V.s(-1).

To prepare the GHCAs, graphene is introduced into the pyrolyzed resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) aerogel, which significantly improves the electrical conductivity. At the same time, large interfaces between graphene sheets and pyrolyzed RF resin generate an energy filtering effect, which increases the Seebeck coefficient. This strategy promises a power factor which is two orders of magnitude higher than that of pure pyrolyzed RF aerogel. Moreover, the tenuous solid skeleton and highly open-cell foam structure of the GHCAs lead to ultra low thermal conductivity (0.06 W m(-1) K-1) and apparent density (31 kg m(-3)). This may enable the development of a novel category of ultra-lightweight energy-conversion materials with thermal insulation capability.

Herein, a series of Co20Ni80 hierarchical structures with different surface morphologies, including flower-, urchin-, ball-, and chain-like morphologies, were obtained using structure-directing templates via a facile one-step solvothermal treatment. The microwave reflection loss (RL) of urchin-like Co20Ni80 hierarchical structures reaches as high as -33.5 dB at 3 GHz, with almost twice the RL intensity of the ball-and chain-like structures, and the absorption bandwidth (<-10 dB) is about 5.5 GHz for the flower-like morphology, indicating that the surface nanospikes and nanoflakes on the Co20Ni80 microsphere surfaces have great influences on their magnetic microwave absorption properties. Electron holography analysis reveals that the surface nanospikes and nanoflakes could generate a high density of stray magnetic flux lines and contribute a large saturation magnetization (105.62 emu g(-1) for urchin-like and 96.41 emu g(-1) for flower-like morphology), leading the urchin-like and flower-like Co20Ni80 to possess stronger microwave RL compared with the ball-like and chain-like Co20Ni80 alloys. The eddy-current absorption mechanism mu ''(mu')(-2)(f)(-1) is dominant in the frequency region above 8 GHz, implying that eddy-current loss is a vital factor for microwave RL in the high frequency range. It can be supposed from our findings that different surface morphologies of magnetic hierarchical structures might become an effective path to achieve high-performance microwave absorption for electromagnetic shielding and stealth camouflage applications.

Under heterogeneous light conditions, photosynthates supplied by exposed ramets may promote N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded, connected ramets. This study was conducted to test this hypothesis. Methods Clonal fragments of the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba with two successive ramets were selected. Mother ramets were subjected to full sunlight and offspring ramets were subjected to 80 % shading, and the stolon between the two successive ramets was either severed or left intact. Measurements were taken of photosynthetic and growth parameters. The turnover of available soil N was determined together with the compostion of the rhizosphere microbial community. Key Results The microbial community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets was significantly altered by clonal integration. Positive effects of clonal integration were observed on NAGase activity, net soil N mineralization rate and net soil N nitrification rate. Increased leaf N and chlorophyll content as well as leaf N allocation to the photosynthetic machinery improved the photosynthetic capability of shaded offspring ramets when the stolon was left intact. Clonal integration improved the growth performance of shaded, connected offspring ramets and whole clonal fragments without any cost to the exposed mother ramets. Conclusions Considerable differences in microbial community composition caused by clonal integration may facilitate N assimilation in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. Increased N content in the photosynthetic machinery may allow pre-acclimation to high light conditions for shaded offspring ramets, thus promoting opportunistic light capture. In accordance with the theory of the division of labour, it is suggested that clonal integration may ameliorate the carbon assimilation capacity of clonal plants, thus improving their fitness in temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats.

Unfortunately, the fertilizers used to promote the growth of tea trees inevitably cause significant fluoride accumulation in tea leaves. Here, we disclose that the use of plant polyphenol-Ce hybrid materials as chelating adsorbents effectively suppressed the accumulation of fluoride in tea leaves when compound fertilizers were applied during the growing period of tea plants. The adjacent phenolic hydroxyls of plant polyphenols were able to chelate with the Al3+ in the soil and prevent the formation and absorption of AlFx complexes in tea trees. The adsorbents can effectively absorb F- via positively charged Ce4+ based on electrostatic attraction. In field plot experiments, the fluoride accumulation in tea leaves was substantially reduced up to 74.75% when the compound fertilizers were used accompanied by the polyphenol- Ce adsorbents.

This article develops a new robust and self-starting multivariate procedure based on multivariate Smirnov test (MST), which integrates a multivariate two-sample goodness-of-fit (GOF) test based on multivariate empirical distribution function (MEDF) and the change-point model. As expected, simulation results show that our proposed control chart is robust to nonnormally distributed data, and moreover, it is efficient in detecting process shifts, especially large shifts, which is one of the main draw-backs of most robust control charts in the literature.

The crystal structures of 1, 2 and 3 center dot 2MeCN have been determined. The structure of the bis(imido) complex 1 contains two unique molecules paired up via weak pi-stacking, whereas the structure of 2 contains a chelating amine/imido ligand, and is made up of discrete units of two cations and two anions which are interacting via H-bonding. The tetra-nuclear structure 3 contains four different types of distorted octahedral molybdenum centre, and a bent Me3SiO group thought to originate from the precursor synthesis. Complexes 1-3 have been screened for their ability to ring open polymerize (ROP) epsilon-caprolactone. For 1 and 3 (not 2), conversion rates were good (>90%) at high temperatures (100 degrees C) over 6-24 h, and the polymerization proceeded in a living manner.

In this work, new lead-free multifunctional ceramics of Ca1-x(LiHo)(x/2)Bi4Ti4O15 were prepared by a conventional solid-state reaction method. The great multi-improvement in ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity, down/up-conversion luminescence and temperature stability of the multifunctional properties is induced by the partial substitution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) for Ca2+ ions in CaBi4Ti4O15. All the ceramics possess a bismuth-layer structure, and the crystal structure of the ceramics is changed from a four layered bismuth-layer structure to a three-layered structure with the level of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) increasing. The ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits simultaneously, high resistivity (R = 4.51 x 10(11) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 10.2 pC N-1), high Curie temperature (T-C = 814 degrees C), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 9.03 mu C cm(-2)) and enhanced luminescence. These behaviours are greatly associated with the contribution of (Li0.5Ho0.5)(2+) in the ceramics. Under the excitation of 451 nm light, the ceramic with x = 0.1 exhibits a strong green emission peak centered at 545 nm, corresponding to the transition of the S-5(2) -> I-5(8) level in Ho3+ ions, while a strong red up-conversion emission band located at 660 nm is observed under the near-infrared excitation of 980 nm at room temperature, arising from the transition of F-5(5) -> I-5(8) levels in Ho3+ ions. Surprisingly, the excellent temperature stability of ferroelectricity/piezoelectricity/luminescence and superior water-resistance behaviors of piezoelectricity/luminescence are also obtained in the ceramic with x = 0.1. Our study suggests that the present ceramics may have potential applications in advanced multifunctional devices at high temperature.

Despite this, the use of scales without reference to "local" psychometric data is still widespread. In this study we examined the factor structure of the short 21-item form of the Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21), when it was applied to adolescent samples recruited from high schools in Australia (N = 371), Chile (N = 448), China (N = 558), and Malaysia (N = 388). Multigroup confirmatory factor analyses revealed that the purported three-factor structure of the DASS-21 was supported in each location with structural invariance across locations. While convergent and divergent validity studies are required to support this finding, the DASS-21 appears to be suitable for use with adolescents in these locations.

In this work, the critical roles of Mn-ions in tailoring the electrical and magnetic properties of BiFeO3-based materials are revealed: the introduction of MnO2 into BiFe0.96Sc0.04O3-BaTiO3 induces a dramatic improvement in insulation, piezoelectricity and multiferroicity. New compositions of BiFe0.96Sc0.04O3-BaTiO3 + x mol% MnO2 were synthesized by a conventional solid-state reaction method. All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and monoclinic phases is formed at x = 0.5-1.0. The formation of Fe-Fe3+(2+) and V-O2-(center dot center dot) is noticeably suppressed and the resistivity of the ceramics is increased by similar to 100 times after the addition of 0.5-1.0 mol% MnO2, which make the ceramic polarizable and thus give strong ferroelectricity and considerable piezoelectricity. The ceramics with the MPB composition exhibit high electrical insulation (R = 1.2-1.7 x 10(10) Omega cm), good piezoelectricity (d(33) = 123-143 pC N-1, k(p) = 0.34-0.35), strong ferroelectricity (P-r = 13.1-17.6 mu C cm(-2)), high Curie temperature (590-596 degrees C) and excellent temperature stability of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties. These improvements are greatly associated with the contribution of Mn-ions in the ceramics. Surprisingly, sharply enhanced ferromagnetism with M-r = 0.4946 emu g(-1) and M-s = 1.0298 emu g(-1) is obtained in the ceramic with x = 7.0, almost one thousand times larger than that of an un-doped ceramic. The origin of unusual ferromagnetism is associated with significant changes in magnetic ordering caused by Mn doping. The high magnetoelectric effect (alpha(33) = 429.6 mV cm(-1) Oe(-1)) is obtained after the addition of 2.0 mol% Mn ions. Our study suggests that the present ceramics may have potential applications in advanced memory devices as promising lead-free high temperature piezoelectric and multiferroic materials.

These materials have been synthesized in good yields by the Cu-catalyzed coupling cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC) between 1,3,5,-tris(2-trimethylsilylethynyl)benzene and three equivalents of the appropriate discogen bearing a pending terminated-azide alkyl substituent. The molecular structures of the discotic oligomers, thereof consisting of three lateral triphenylenes linked together by various soft methylene spacers to a central 1,3,5-tris(triazolyl)benzene, have been fully characterized by H-1 and C-13 NMR, and their purity confirmed by elemental analysis. Their thermal and liquid crystalline supramolecular organization behaviours have been studied by combining polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. These investigations showed that only the two oligomers with short spacers display a hexagonal columnar mesophase, while those with long spacer are not mesomorphic. Scanning tunneling microscopy revealed that one of the mesomorphic oligomer self-assembles on a solid/liquid interface into a well ordered two-dimensional architecture that closely resembles to the proposed bulk mesomorphic supramolecular organization deduced from X-ray measurements. Furthermore, columnar mesophases have been induced in the corresponding hydrogen-bonded supramolecular complexes obtained by reaction of one of the nonmesogenic oligomeric derivative with various simple acids, e.g. hexanoic, benzoic, and 4-hexyloxybenzoic acids, respectively, in molar ratios of 1 : 2 and 1 : 3. The optical properties of these D-A dyads have been studied by UV-Vis absorption and fluorescent emission.

The lithium-sulfur (Li-S) battery with rGO-coated separator exhibits much smaller impedance and much better electrochemical performance. After coated rGO, the initial discharge capacity can be as large as 1067 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C which can retain 878 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles, and the discharge capacity can reach 710 mAh g-1 even at 2 C. The significant performance enhancement can be attributed to the bi-functionality of rGO; the rGO coating layer has unique porous structure, high conductivity and various kinds of functional groups, which can not only effectively prevent the diffusion of polysulfide through the separator, but also significantly increase the conducting surface between cathode and separator. It is promising to use rGO-based slurry to continuously produce large-scale, low-cost, and bi-functional rGO coated separator for high-performance Li-S batteries.

The dielectric constant obtained using GROMOS with TIP3P matches with the experimental results from dielectric spectroscopy (DRS) with minimum error. The structural information of MSG aqueous solution was also investigated. It was found that the hydration shells of water around charged particles (Na+ and Glu(-)) highly influence the dielectric constant of the solution. In addition to the first hydration shell, the second shell also affects the dielectric constant. Glu(-) weakened the hydrogen bond (HB) lifetime between water molecules in MSG aqueous solution compared to the water-water HB lifetime in pure water.

Reaction of the parent dialdehyde [1,3-(CHO)(2)-5-MeC6H2OH-2] with [Cu(OAc)(2)] in the presence of Et3N afforded, following work-up, a polymeric chain (3) comprising {[Cu-2(OAc)(4)] OAc}(n,) HNEt3 and MeCN. The crystal structures of 1 (R-1 = Me, R-2 = iPr 1a; R-1 = Cl, R-2 = iPr 1b), 2 (R-1 = Me, R-2 = Me 2a; R-1 = Me, R-2 = iPr 2b; R-1 = tBu, R-2 = Me 2c; R-1 = Cl, R-2 = Me 2d; R-1 = Cl, R-2 = iPr 2e; R-1 = tBu, R-2 = iPr 2f) and 3 are reported (synchrotron radiation was necessary for 3). The magnetic properties of the cluster 2b are presented. Complexes of type 2 and 3 were screened for the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone, with or without benzyl alcohol present, under a variety of conditions, however only trace polymer was isolated. The electrochemistry of all complexes was also investigated, together with their ability to catalyze benzene oxidation (using hydrogen peroxide); although low conversions were observed, the tetra-nuclear complexes exhibited excellent selectivity.

It is a self-starting scheme and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages. Moreover, we do not require any prior knowledge of the underlying distribution. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also is efficient in detecting various magnitudes of shifts. An illustrative example is given to introduce the implementation of our proposed DNC control chart. It is easy to construct and fast to compute.

The working time of each component is an exponentially distributed random variable and the repair time of each failed component is governed by an arbitrary distribution. Moreover, we assume that every component is "as good as new" after being repaired. Under these assumptions, several important reliability measures such as the availability, the rate of occurrence of failures, and the mean time to first failure of the system are derived by employing the supplementary variable technique and the Laplace transform. Meanwhile, their recursive expressions are obtained. Furthermore, through numerical examples, we study the influence of various parameters on the system reliability measures. Finally, the Monte Carlo simulation and two special cases of the system which are (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system and 1-out-of-n:G repairable system are presented to illustrate the correctness of the analytical results.

Filling the distributional gap by discovery of a new population or a species has significant bio-geographic implications, because it suggests a much wider past distribution and provides evidence for the route of range expansion/contraction. The salamandrid genus Echinotriton (commonly known as spiny salamanders, spiny newts, or crocodile newts) has two species that are restricted to two widely separated areas, one in eastern Zhejiang province, China and the other in the Ryukyu Archipelago of Japan. It has been hypothesized that Echinotriton was once continuously distributed between the two areas through a historical land bridge that connected mainland China, Taiwan, and the archipelago. Finding fossils or relic populations along the postulated distribution are strong evidence for the hypothesis. Hundred-twenty-two years after the description of E. andersoni and eight-one years after that of E. chinhaiensis, we discover a third species of Echinotriton in southern China, which fills the distributional gap of the former two species. Species status of the new species is confirmed through molecular phylogenetic analysis and morphological comparison. Mitochondrial DNA indicates that the new species is sister to E. chinhaiensis, while nuclear DNA does not support this relationship. The new species has a very large quadrate projection, a single line of lateral warts pierced by distal rib extremities, normally developed 5th toes, and conical skin tubercles. Our discovery supports the hypothesis that there was a continuous distribution of Echinotriton from eastern coastal China to the Ryukyu Archipelago. We suggest that other species of this genus may also be found in Taiwan. Due to the rarity of this new species, we urge all hobbyists to refrain themselves from collecting this salamander or leaking locality information if encountered, and boycott any trading.

It is shown that spectral shifts and spectral switches are affected both by the polarization of the incident light wave and by the characters of the scattering medium. Moreover, numerical results show that the direction at which the spectral switch occurs is governed by the characters of the scattering medium, whereas the magnitude of the spectral switch is affected by the polarization of the incident light wave.

To address this issue, a statistics-based reputation method for reliable data fusion is proposed in this study. Different from traditional reputation methods that only compute the general reputation of a node, the proposed method modeled by negative binomial reputation consists of two separated reputation metrics: fusion reputation and sensing reputation. Fusion reputation aims to select data fusion points and sensing reputation is used to weigh the data reported by sensor nodes to the fusion point. So, this method can prevent a compromised node from covering its misbehavior in the process of sensing or fusion by behaving well in the fusion or sensing. To tackle the unexpected facts such as packet loss, a discounting factor is introduced into the proposed method. Additionally, Local Outlier Factor (LOF) based outlier detection is applied to evaluate the behavior result of sensor nodes. Simulations show that the proposed method can enhance the reliability of data fusion and is more accurate than the general reputation method when applied in reputation evaluation.

Then, in the fully observable case, we first consider the joining strategy in a decentralized manner, that is, arriving customers observe the queue size and then decide whether or not to join the queue based on the net benefit they will obtain upon the completion of service. Secondly, we derive the threshold strategy that will yield the system's maximal expected profit, to reach the so-called social welfare optimization. Finally, Nash equilibrium and socially optimal mixed strategies are derived in the fully unobservable case. Moreover, some numerical examples are provided to explore the impact of system parameters on customer's joining behavior. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Hu, YB; Zhao, YH; Wang, XF				Hu, Yi-Bin; Zhao, Yong-Hong; Wang, Xue-Feng			A computational investigation of topological insulator Bi2Se3 film	FRONTIERS OF PHYSICS			English	Article						topological insulator; spin-orbit coupling; helical state	SINGLE DIRAC CONE	Topological insulators have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator and conducting states on their edge or surface which are formed by spin-orbit coupling and protected by time-reversal symmetry. We report theoretical analyses of the electronic properties of three-dimensional topological insulator Bi2Se3 film on different energies. We choose five different energies (-123, -75, 0, 180, 350 meV) around the Dirac cone (-113 meV). When energy is close to the Dirac cone, the properties of wave function match the topological insulator's hallmark perfectly. When energy is far way from the Dirac cone, the hallmark of topological insulator is broken and the helical states disappear. The electronic properties of helical states are dug out from the calculation results. The spin-momentum locking of the helical states are confirmed. A 3-fold symmetry of the helical states in Brillouin zone is also revealed. The penetration depth of the helical states is two quintuple layers which can be identified from layer projection. The charge contribution on each quintuple layer depends on the energy, and has completely different behavior along K and M direction in Brillouin zone. From orbital projection, we can find that the maximum charge contribution of the helical states is p (z) orbit and the charge contribution on p (y) and p (x) orbits have 2-fold symmetry.

However, the biomass accumulation can be inhibited by high level of ammonium (NH4+) in non-diluted livestock wastewater and the mechanism of ammonium inhibition is not fully understood. In this study, the effect of high concentration of NH4+ on L. minor biomass accumulation was investigated using NH4+ as sole source of nitrogen (N). NH4+-induced toxicity symptoms were observed when L. minor was exposed to high concentrations of ammonium nitrogen (NH4+-N) after a 7-day cultivation. L. minor exposed to the NH4+-N concentration of 840 mg l(-1) exhibited reduced relative growth rate, contents of carbon (C) and photosynthetic pigments, and C/N ratio. Ammonium irons were inhibitory to the synthesis of photosynthetic pigments and caused C/N imbalance in L. minor. These symptoms could further cause premature senescence of the fronds, and restrain their reproduction, growth and biomass accumulation. L. minor could grow at NH4+-N concentrations of 7-84 mg l(-1) and the optimal NH4+-N concentration was 28 mg l(-1).

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PTSD and PTG and also tested for the gender differences in PTSD and PTG subgroups. A stratification random sampling strategy and questionnaires were used to collect the data. The PTSD was assessed using the PTSD Check list-Civilian and the PTG was assessed using the Post traumatic growth inventory. 2,300 individuals were involved in the initial survey with 2,080 completing the final questionnaire, a response rate of 90.4 %. One-way ANOVA analyses were performed to investigate the gender differences in the PTSD and PTG subgroups. One year following the earthquake, 40.1 and 51.1 % of survivors reported PTSD and PTG, respectively. A bivariate correlation analysis indicated that there was a positive association between PTG and PTSD. The PTG and PTSD variance analysis conducted on female and male subgroups suggested that women were more affected than men. Given the relatively high PTG prevalence, it was concluded that researchers need to pay more attention to the positive outcomes of an earthquake rather than just focusing on the negative effects. The surveys and analyses indicated that psychological intervention and care for the earthquake disaster survivors should focus more on females and older people, who tend to be more adversely affected.

Our results are in agreement well with available experimental data and previous theoretical studies. The full elastic constants and bulk shear modulus of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) are obtained in the wide pressure range. Results indicated that these phases of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) are strongly pressure dependent. And the CrB4 in Immm structure is the most ultraincompressible among the considered phases at 0 GPa. By the mechanical stability criteria, it is predicted that these phases of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) compounds are stable up to 100 GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that all the structures of TMB4 (TM = V, Cr, Mn) possess brittle nature in the range of pressure from 0 GPa to 100 GPa except the Pnnm structure of MnB4, which is higher than 1.75, indicating that the Pnnm structure of MnB4 is prone to ductility when the pressure is above 73 GPa.

The influences of system parameters on its energy transmittance and integration error are explored in detail. The numerical analysis shows that, enhanced energy transmittance and integration time window can be simultaneously achieved by increased injected current in the vicinity of lasing threshold. We find that the range of input pulse-width with lower integration error is highly sensitive to the injected optical power, due to gain saturation and induced detuning deviation mechanism. The initial frequency detuning should also be carefully chosen to suppress the integration deviation with ideal waveform output.

Their structure and physical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), specific surface analyzer, X-ray diffraction (XRD), UV-vis absorption spectra and photoluminescence spectra (PL). SEM analysis indicated that the well-defined surface morphology of natural cotton fiber was mostly preserved in TiO2 and Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers. Compared with TiO2 fiber, the absorbance wavelengths of Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers were apparently red shifted and the PL intensities revealed a significant decrease. By using the photocatalytic degradation of black liquor as a model reaction, the visible light and ultraviolet light catalytic efficiencies of TiO2, Ag3PO4 and Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers were evaluated. The reaction results showed that Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers had stronger photocatalytic activity and excellent chemical stability in repeated and long-term applications. Therefore, the prepared Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers could act as an efficient catalyst for the photocatalytic degradation of black liquor, which suggested their promising applications. It was proposed that the center dot OH radicals played the leading role in the photocatalytic degradation of the black liquor by Ag3PO4/TiO2 fibers system. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V.

The ceramics sintered at 890-990 degrees C possess a pure perovskite structure. A morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and monoclinic phases is formed at x = 0.05. A small amount of Nd improves the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes gradually diffusive with x increasing. After the addition of Nd, the ferromagnetism of the ceramics is greatly enhanced by similar to 320%. The increase in sintering temperature improves significantly the ferroelectric, piezoelectric, and ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics. The ceramics with x = 0.05 sintered at 950-990 degrees C possess improved ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, magnetism and insulation with P-r of 16.5-17.5 mu C/cm(2), d(33) of 113-121 pC/ N, M-r of 0.127-0.138 emu/g, R of similar to 5 x 10(9) Omega.cm and high T-C of 473-482 degrees C, indicating that the ceramic is a promising candidate for room-temperature multiferroic and high-temperature piezoelectric materials.

From the results of the probe experiment, we found that the HE-Dy(SIC) complex could compete with AO for intercalating into hsDNA. The binding constants of the HE-Dy(SIC) complex to hsDNA was obtained by the double reciprocal method and indicated that the affinity between hsDNA and the complex is weaker than that between hsDNA and classical intercalators. The thermodynamic parameters(Delta H degrees, Delta G degrees, Delta S degrees) were calculated from the UV-vis absorption data measured at two different temperatures. Further experimental results suggested that there exist groove binding and partial intercalation binding between hsDNA and HE-Dy(SIC) complex.

J	Li, L; Xu, CQ				Li, Li; Xu, Changqing			On Ergodic Sum Capacity of Fading Channels in OFDMA-Based Cognitive Radio Networks	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Cognitive radio (CR); ergodic sum capacity; fading channels; orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA); resource allocation	OPTIMAL POWER ALLOCATION; RESOURCE-ALLOCATION	An orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA)-based cognitive radio network (CRN) is considered where cognitive radio users (CRUs) can only access the frequency bands not being occupied by primary users (PUs) while keeping the cross-channel interference to each PU under a specified threshold. In this paper, we investigate the ergodic sum capacity of all CRUs in OFDMA-based networks and consider the constraints on the long-term transmit power of all CRUs, the long-term interference thresholds of PUs, and the statistical proportional fairness of all CRUs. In OFDMA-based CRNs, the number of available subchannels is smaller than that of CRUs in some OFDM symbol durations. To deal with this time-varying nature of available spectrum resource and achieve the ergodic sum capacity of all CRUs, we propose an optimal resource-allocation algorithm under the given constraints. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve substantial capacity gains for CRUs over the traditional resource-allocation algorithm and maintain the statistical proportional rate constraints of all CRUs.

The microstructure, multiferroic, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics have been studied. The ceramics sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2h possess a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at x=0.02. After the addition of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, two dielectric anomalies are observed at high temperatures (T-m similar to 510 degrees C-570 degrees C and T(2 similar to)720 degrees C). The phase transition around T-m becomes wider gradually with increasing x. The ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, and ferromagnetism of the ceramics are significantly improved after the addition of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3. High resistivity (similar to 1.3x10(9)cm), strong ferroelectricity (P-r=27.4C/cm(2)), good piezoelectricity (d(33)=140pC/N, k(p)=31.4%), and weak magnetic properties (M-r=0.19emu/g) are observed.

An anomalous maximum in the bandwidths of the Li ions related modes is observed. It should be apparent that there are at least two distinct thermally activated processes.

Then equilibrium geometry of 2, 3-DCP was optimized, and based on this, the harmonic vibrational frequencies, infrared intensities and Raman activities were calculated using B3LYP method of the density function theory (DFT) in conjunction with 6-311++G(2df, 2pd) basis set, furthermore, a comprehensive anharmonic calculation was also been performed for obtaining more accurate vibrational frequencies using second-order perturbation theory treatment based on quadratic, cubic and quartic force constants. Infrared and Raman spectra were simulated corresponding to theory. Experimental FTIR and FT-Raman bands were compared with those positions of peaks obtained from anharmonic calculations and intensities or activities from harmonic carefully. Each vibrational band was assigned and interpreted in detail with help of potential energy distribution (FED) for the first time. In addition, it was shown that anharmonic results exactly reproduced to experimental data, improved the validity of prediction greatly in vibration frequencies, discrepancies between anharmonic and experimental results were limited to below 10 cm(-1) in most of vibrational bands, even if in the high energy regions, which have a poor performance for hanmonic calculation, and these differences would be decreased to lower than 19 cm(-1). It is extremely helpful for assigning and predicting vibrational spectra. Present conclusion can be expanded to others molecular systems.

In this article, we propose a new KNN-based classifier, called the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor (LMPNN) rule. It is motivated by the local mean-based k-nearest neighbor (LMKNN) rule and the pseudo nearest neighbor (PNN) rule, with the aim of improving the classification performance. In the proposed LMPNN, the k nearest neighbors from each class are searched as the class prototypes, and then the local mean vectors of the neighbors are yielded. Subsequently, we attempt to find the local mean-based pseudo nearest neighbor per class by employing the categorical k local mean vectors, and classify the unknown query patten according to the distances between the query and the pseudo nearest neighbors To assess the classification performance of the proposed LMPNN, it is compared with the competing classifiers, such as LMKNN and PNN, in terms of the classification error on thirty-two real UCI data sets, four artificial data sets and three image data sets. The comprehensively experimental results suggest that the proposed LMPNN classifier is a promising algorithm in pattern recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One hundred and six Malaysian Malays, 55 Malaysian Chinese, 195 Chinese from China, and 45 non-Asian Australians aged 12 to 19 years completed a questionnaire assessing dissatisfaction with their overall body and dissatisfaction with varying aspects of their body. Dissatisfaction with the face, height, and hair was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Malays after body mass index, age and dissatisfaction with body areas typically included in measures (weight/shape, upper, middle, and lower body, and muscles) had been controlled for. Dissatisfaction with the face was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Chinese. These findings demonstrate the differences in body focus for males from different cultures and the importance of using assessment measures that address all possible areas of body focus.

According to the two-category decision theoretic rough set model, this paper mainly investigates quantitative reducts and their hierarchies (with qualitative reducts) from a regional perspective. (1) An improved type of classification regions is proposed, and its preservation reduct (CRP-Reduct) is studied. (2) Reduction targets and preservation properties of set regions are analyzed, and the set-region preservation reduct (SRP-Reduct) is studied. (3) Separability of set regions and rule consistency is verified, and the quantitative and qualitative double-preservation reduct (DP-Reduct) is established. (4) Hierarchies of CRP-Reduct, SRP-Reduct, and DP-Reduct are explored with two qualitative reducts: the Pawlalc-Reduct and knowledge-preservation reduct (KP-Reduct). (5) Finally, verification experiments are provided. CRP-Reduct, SRP-Reduct, and DP-Reduct expand layer by layer Pawlak-Reduct and exhibit quantitative applicability, and the experimental results indicate their effectiveness and hierarchies regarding Pawlak-Reduct and KP-Reduct.

Due to strong spin-orbit interaction (SOI) and the atomic structure of the two-dimensional lattice, monolayer WSe2 has an electronic structure that exhibits Zeeman-like up-down spin texture near the K and K' points of the Brillouin zone. In a FET, the gate electric field induces an extra, externally tunable SOI that re-orients the spins into a Rashba-like texture thereby realizing electric control of the spin. The conductance of FET is modulated by the spin texture, namely by if the spin orientation of the carrier after the gated channel region, matches or miss-matches that of the FET drain electrode. The carrier current I-tau,I-s in the FET is labelled by both the valley index and spin index, realizing valleytronics and spintronics in the same device.

An invariant foliation decomposes the state space into geometric regions of different dynamical regimes, and thus helps understand dynamics. A slow invariant foliation is established for this system. It is shown that the slow foliation converges to a critical foliation (i.e., the scale parameter is zero) in probability distribution, as the scale parameter tends to zero. The approximation of slow foliation is also constructed with error estimate in distribution. Furthermore, the geometric structure of the slow foliation is investigated: every fiber of the slow foliation parallels each other, with the slow manifold as a special fiber. In fact, when an arbitrarily chosen point of a fiber falls in the slow manifold, the fiber must be the slow manifold itself. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Kirkwood correlation factor of CC model in adjustable infinite dielectric constant is more changeable with temperature than DC model. The Kirkwood factor with different conditions needs reinterpretation. CC model generally depicts molecular cooperative interactions with single channel and evaluates once relaxation act of DMSO cluster within a cutoff time. DC model couples multi-channels, including various relaxation modes such as monomeric, dimeric and cluster. So the relaxation time of DC model is higher than CC model. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Chinese T. indicum was soaked with CTA and APP alone or in combination for 10, 20, and 30 min at 35, 45, and 55 degrees C. A disinfection method using CTA and APP (3% CTA + 3% APP for 20 min at 45 degrees C) was obtained. Under this set of combination, the experimental values of microbial counts of mesophilic aerobic bacteria, mesophilic anaerobic bacteria, and fungi were 2.31 +/- 0.4 log CFU/g, < 1.0 log CFU/g, and < 1.0 log CFU/g, respectively. Through the analysis of sensory qualities and microbial populations for MAP-or VAC-packed Chinese T. indicum, the shelf life of soaked truffles was prolonged to 45 or 40 d, respectively. The synergistic effect of CTA and APP may provide valuable insight into the reduction of microorganisms on fresh truffles.

A systematic search of databases and journals identified 21 papers that met the inclusion criteria. Two broad themes emerged from an analysis of the literatures, which included processes and outcomes of interactions with peers and intervention programs. The research indicates that children who are D/HH face great difficulties in communicating, initiating/entering, and maintaining interactions with hearing peers in inclusive settings. The co-enrollment and social skills training programs are considered to be effective interventions for their social interaction. Communication abilities and social skills of children who are D/HH, responses of children with normal hearing, and the effect of environment are highlighted as crucial aspects of social interactions. In addition, future research is needed to study the interaction between children who are D/HH and hearing peers in natural settings, at different stages of school life, as well as improving social interaction and establishing an inclusive classroom climate for children who are D/HH.

Enhancement of squeezing in an electromagnetically induced transparent system using a microwave field	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						squeezing; electromagnetically induced transparency; quantum electrodynamics; microwave field	ATOMIC SYSTEM; LIGHT; PHASE; ABSORPTION; STORAGE; CAVITY; GAS	We investigate the output squeezing of a squeezed vacuum as a probe field propagating through a collection of Lambda-type atoms by using a microwave field to drive the dipole-forbidden transition constructed by the ground states. It is found that when the microwave field is increased, the degree of the output squeezing for a squeezed vacuum can be enhanced and the squeezing regions in the frequency domain become wider. In particular, the output squeezing from a shot noise can be produced by adjusting the microwave field. Meanwhile the electromagnetically induced transparency of the quantum field is also optimized. This can be useful in controllable quantum communication.	[Chen, J.; Hou, B. P.] Sichuan Normal Univ, Inst Solid Phys, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Hou, B.

J	Li, JL; Wang, XY; Li, G; Zhang, FQ; Feng, D				Li, Junli; Wang, Xiuying; Li, Gang; Zhang, Fuqiang; Feng, David			Quality assessment of perceptual color video based on a top-down framework and quaternion	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Video quality assessment; Top-down framework; Cognitive analysis; Quaternion; Singular value decomposition; Edge; Chrominance; Temporal correlation	IMAGE QUALITY; MODEL	Objective video quality assessment is of great importance in a variety of video processing applications. Most existing video quality metrics either focus primarily on capturing spatial artifacts in the video signal, or are designed to assess only grayscale video thereby ignoring important chrominance information. In this paper, on the basis of the top-down visual analysis of cognitive understanding and video features, we propose and develop a novel full-reference perceptual video assessment technique that accepts visual information inputs in the form of a quaternion consisting of contour, color and temporal information. Because of the more important role of chrominance information in the "border-to-surface" mechanism at early stages of cognitive visual processing, our new metric takes into account the chrominance information rather than the luminance information utilized in conventional video quality assessment. Our perceptual quaternion model employs singular value decomposition (SVD) and utilizes the human visual psychological features for SVD block weighting to better reflect perceptual focus and interest. Our major contributions include: a new perceptual quaternion that takes chrominance as one spatial feature, and temporal information to model motion or changes across adjacent frames; a three-level video quality measure to reflect visual psychology; and the two weighting methods based on entropy and frame correlation. Our experimental validation on the video quality experts' group (VQEG) Phase I FR-TV test dataset demonstrated that our new assessment metric outperforms PSNR, SSIM, PVQM (P8) and has high correlation with perceived video quality.

From the reaction of p-tert-butylcalix[61areneH(6) with one or two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)], only the oxo-bridged complex {[W(eg)](2)(mu-O)p-tert-butylcalix[6]arene} (1) could be isolated, whereas the use of four equivalents of [W(eg)(3)], in the presence of molecular sieves, afforded {[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[6]areneH(2)}center dot 2MeCN (2); molecules of 2 pack in bi-layers. Under similar conditions, use of one or two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] and p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(8) afforded {[W(eg)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]arene}center dot MeCN (3) in which each tungsten centre was bound by four calixarene oxygens. By contrast, the small orange prisms resulting from the use of four equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] and p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(8) were shown by synchrotron radiation to be a mixture of two isomers (4a/4b.3.5MeCN). In the major isomer {1,2-[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(4)} (4a), two tungsten centres bind to neighbouring sets of phenolate oxygens, whereas in the minor isomer {1,3-[W(eg)(2)](2)p-tert-butylcalix[8]areneH(4)} (4b), there is a protonated phenolic group between the two pairs of phenolate oxygens bound to tungsten; the major : minor ratio is about 83 : 17. Use of p-tert-butyltetrahomodioxacalix[6]areneH(6) with two equivalents of [W(eg)(3)] resulted in the isolation of {[WO(eg)](2)p-tert-butyltetrahomodioxacalix[6]areneH(2)} (5.0.83toluene. MeCN), in which each dimethyleneoxa bridge is bound to an oxotungsten(VI) centre. Complexes 1-5, together with the known complex [W(eg)p-tert-butylcalix[4]arene] (6), have been screened for their ability to ring open polymerize (ROP) epsilon-caprolactone; for 1, 2 and 5, 6 conversion rates were good (>88%) at 110 degrees C over 12 or 24 h, whereas the calix[8]arene complexes 3 and 4 under the same conditions were inactive.

J	Lei, NF; Li, J; Ni, SJ; Chen, JS				Lei, Ningfei; Li, Jun; Ni, Shijun; Chen, Jinsong			Effects of Clonal Integration on Microbial Community Composition and Processes in the Rhizosphere of the Stoloniferous Herb Glechoma longituba (Nakai) Kuprian	PLOS ONE			English	Article							FITNESS-RELATED TRAITS; ORGANIC-MATTER; EXOENZYME ACTIVITY; MYCORRHIZAL FUNGI; EXTRACTION METHOD; ENZYME-ACTIVITIES; NITROGEN UPTAKE; SOIL-NITROGEN; CARBON FLOW; PLANT	The effects of rhizodeposition on soil C and N availabilities lead to substantial changes of microbial community composition and processes in the rhizosphere of plants. Under heterogeneous light, photosynthates can be translocated or shared between exposed and shaded ramets by clonal integration. Clonal integration may enhance the rhizodeposition of the shaded ramets, which further influences nutrient recycling in their rhizosphere. To test the hypothesis, we conducted a pot experiment by the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba subjected to heterogeneous light. Microbial biomass and community composition in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets, assessed by phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) analysis, were markedly altered by clonal integration. Clonal integration positively affected C, N availabilities, invertase and urease activities, N mineralization (N-min) and nitrification rates (N-nitri) in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, an opposite pattern was also observed in phenoloxidase (POXase) and peroxidase (PODase) activities. Our results demonstrated that clonal integration facilitated N assimilation and uptake in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets.

J	Wang, J; Chen, J; Lei, Y; Li, P				Wang, Jing; Chen, Jing; Lei, Yi; Li, Peng			P300, not feedback error-related negativity, manifests the waiting cost of receiving reward information	NEUROREPORT			English	Article						feedback error-related negativity; P300; waiting cost	ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE; MAGNITUDE; VALENCE; ERP	Previous studies have investigated how temporal discounting influences reward processing in the human brain; however, it remains unclear whether a short delay in presenting an outcome affects brain activity related to reward processing that is indexed by the two event-related potential components: the feedback error-related negativity (fERN) and P300 components. The present study used a revised simple gambling task and manipulated the waiting time before reward presentation. Behavioral data showed that participants did not respond differently between conditions; however, they reported more negative emotion under long-waiting conditions than under short-waiting conditions. Event-related potential results showed that fERN was not significantly different between the two conditions, whereas the short-waiting feedback elicited a notably larger P300 amplitude than the long-waiting feedback, particularly in frontal-central regions. The present study shows that P300, not fERN, reflects high-level motivated evaluation of waiting cost in such a decision-making task.

The chemical structures of the resulting material are confirmed by FT-IR and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. To analyse the mechanism of the pH sensitivity of this polymer, its structural transformations under acidic and basic conditions are studied by FT-IR spectroscopy, theoretical calculations and H-1-NMR spectroscopy. We observe that the mechanism of pH responsiveness is the formation of a hydrogen bond interaction between the N atom of the pyridine ring and H-N of urethane in neutral or alkaline environments which is disrupted under acidic conditions due to the protonation of the pyridine ring. The pH-sensitivity is demonstrated by simply adjusting the pH value of the environment, which can act as a switch to control shape memory and drug release. Unlike other systems with thermally sensitive behaviour, the shape memory functionality of this material is independent of temperature, which is dependent only on the variation in the pH of the environment. This strategy provides a potent tool for the design of multifunctional materials based on the physiological environment to fulfil the complex requirements of drug delivery and tissue engineering systems.

A primary process with an asymmetric shape is observed. The mixture behaviour is described according to four Cole-Davidson terms whose evolution with composition is analysed. Numbers of hydrogen bonds between water-water and DMAC-water pairs are estimated from the values of the static dielectric constant by using the Luzar model. The model provides a satisfactory explanation of the experimental results related to the static dielectric constant. The hydrogen bond binding energies for water-water and DMAC-water are estimated to be -13.5 and -16.9 kJ mol(-1); we also report a strategy to parameterise effective DMAC-water cluster interactions to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of the relaxation acts.

J	Yu, MM; Tang, YH; Wu, WQ; Zhou, J				Yu, Miaomiao; Tang, Yinghui; Wu, Wenqing; Zhou, Jie			Optimal order-replacement policy for a phase-type geometric process model with extreme shocks	APPLIED MATHEMATICAL MODELLING			English	Article						Shock model; Maintenance; Phase-type distribution; Geometric process; Procurement	DETERIORATING-SYSTEM; REPAIRABLE SYSTEM; MAINTENANCE MODEL; LEAD-TIME; PROCUREMENT	A system is subject to random shocks that arrive according to a phase-type (PH) renewal process. As soon as an individual shock exceeds some given level the system will break down. The failed system can be repaired immediately. With the increasing number of repairs, the maximum shock level that the system can withstand will be decreasing, while the consecutive repair times after failure will become longer and longer. Undergoing a specified number of repairs, the existing system will be replaced by a new and identical one. The spare system for the replacement is available only by sending a purchase order to a supplier, and the duration of spare system procurement lead time also follows a PH distribution. Based on the number of system failures, a new order-replacement policy (also called (K, N) policy) is proposed in this paper. Using the closure property of the PH distribution, the long-run average cost rate for the system is given by the renewal reward theorem. Finally, through numerical calculation, it is determined an optimal order-replacement policy such that the long-run expected cost rate is minimum. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

These composites were characterized by FTIR, wide-angle X-ray scattering (WAXS), dynamic mechanical analysis and thermogravimetry techniques. In WAXS profiles, above 22 wt% TSI-POSS concentration, the morphology of composite is significantly altered and distinct crystallite clusters are formed, which increase the volume of hard segment in polyurethane (PU) hybrid composite. As TSI-POSS concentration rises, the glass transition temperature (T (g)) of composites is increased while the decomposition temperature is slightly decreased due to the oxysensitive isobutyl groups in structure. Meanwhile, the activation energy of hybrid composites is nearly unchanged indicating that the formation of crystallite cluster, which restricts motion of surrounding chains, is the predominant effect in T (g) increasing. It can be concluded that the morphology and the thermal property of polyurethane can be tailored by TSI-POSS incorporation, whereas functional group in TSI-POSS structure is the decisive factor for the thermostability of designed composites.

The receivers can simultaneously reconstruct different qubit states containing the joint information from all senders. Compared with the protocols proposed by Su et al. (Int J Quantum Inf 10:1250006 (2012), the information of the prepared states in our schemes is distributed in a different way. Our protocols can be applied not only to states with real parameters but also ones with complex parameters. Moreover, the N-to-2 protocol is suitable for general qubit states besides equatorial states, and the receivers need not to perform any measurements and CNOT gates to reconstruct the states.

The ceramics sintered at 960 A degrees C for 2 h possess a pure perovskite structure and no second phases can be detected. After the addition of Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3, a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases is formed at x = 0.01. The addition of a small amount of Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3 can promote the grain growth, while excess Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)TiO3 causes an inhibition of grain growth. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the structure and electrical properties of the ceramics. The sintering temperature of 960 A degrees C is a critical temperature to obtain the ceramics with good piezoelectric properties. For the ceramic with x = 0.01 sintered at/above 960 A degrees C located at the morphotropic phase boundary, large grains, good densification, high resistivity and enhanced electrical properties are obtained.

We obtain the Fokker-Planck-type dynamic equations, and their stationary solutions are of the Boltzmann-Gibbs form. These processes obey a generalized Einstein-Stokes-Smoluchowski relation and the second Einstein relation. We observe that the asymptotic behavior of waiting times and subordinations are of stretched Gaussian distributions. We also discuss the time averaged in the case of an harmonic potential, and show that the process exhibits aging and ergodicity breaking.

It is found that trilayers with a perpendicular anisotropy possess considerably larger coercivities and smaller remanences and energy products compared with those with an in-plane anisotropy. Increase of beta leads to a fast decrease of the maximum energy product as well as the drop of both remanence and coercivity. Such a drop is much faster than that in the single-phased hard material, which can explain the significant discrepancy between the experiment and the theoretical energy products. Some modeling techniques have been utilized with spin check procedures performed, which yield results in good agreement with the one-dimensional (1D) analytical and experimental data, justifying our calculations. Further, the calculated nucleation fields according to the 3D calculations are larger than those based on the 1D model, whereas the corresponding coercivity is smaller, leading to more square hysteresis loops and better agreement between experimental data and the theory.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Reduction target structure-based hierarchical attribute reduction for two-category decision-theoretic rough sets	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Attribute reduction; Decision-theoretic rough set; Granular computing; Consistency-preservation; Structure target	MODEL; PRECISION; INFORMATION; CLASSIFICATION; LOGICS; GRADE	Attribute reduction is an essential subject in rough set theory, but because of quantitative extension, it becomes a problem when considering probabilistic rough set (PRS) approaches. The decision-theoretic rough set (DTRS) has a threshold semantics and decision feature and thus becomes a typical and fundamental PRS. Based on reduction target structures, this paper investigates hierarchical attribute reduction for a two-category DTRS and is divided into five parts. (1) The knowledge-preservation property and reduct are explored by knowledge coarsening. (2) The consistency-preservation principle and reduct are constructed by a consistency mechanism. (3) Region preservation is analyzed, and the separability between consistency preservation and region preservation is concluded; thus, the double-preservation principle and reduct are studied. (4) Structure targets are proposed by knowledge structures, and an attribute reduction is further described and simulated; thus, general reducts are defined to preserve the structure targets or optimal measures. (5) The hierarchical relationships of the relevant four targets and reducts are analyzed, and a decision table example is provided for illustration. This study offers promotion, rationality, structure, hierarchy and generalization, and it establishes a fundamental reduction framework for two-category DTRS. The relevant results also provide some new insights into the attribute reduction problem for PRS. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Xu and Chen (2008) proposed a number of linear programming models to derive interval weights, but the definitions for the additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relation and the linear programming model still need to be improved. In this paper, a numerical example is given to show how these definitions and models can be improved to increase accuracy. A new additive consistency definition for interval fuzzy preference relations is proposed and novel linear programming models are established to demonstrate the generation of interval weights from an interval fuzzy preference relation.

The results show that obvious nucleation can be observed only when the angle beta between the easy axis and the applied field is equal to 0 degrees, and the nucleation field and the coercivity decrease as the thickness of the soft phase L-s increases. The remanence decreases and the squareness of the hysteresis loop weakens as beta increases, leading to the decrease of the energy product while the largest maximum energy product (561.61 kJ/m(3)) occurs at L-s = 1 nm and beta = 0 degrees. The shapes of the hysteresis loops, the remanence and the coercivity obtained from calculations and experiments are close to each other.

The obtained equilibrium structure and mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with other theoretical results. Then we compared the elastic modulus of RuN2 with several other isomorphic noble metal nitrides. Results show that RuN2 can nearly rival with OsN2 and IrN2, which indicate RuN2 is a potentially ultra-incompressible and hard material. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that RuN2 is stable in our calculations (0-100 GPa). The calculated B/G ratios indicate that RuN2 possesses brittle nature at 0 GPa and when the pressure increases to 13.4 GPa (for LDA) or 20.8 GPa (for GGA), it begins to prone to ductility. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of RuN2. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

Six new truxenone discogens 7a-f with different alkyl chain substitution patterns were synthesised and all exhibited only one three-dimensional ordered hexagonal columnar mesophase with wide temperature ranges including room temperature, which were characterised with polarising optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction. The self-assembly behaviours in solutions were studied by using concentration-variation H-1 NMR and scanning electron microscopy. The two-dimensional ordered self-assembly of 7c and 7f on the liquid-solid interface of highly oriented pyrolytical graphite were imaged by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and the results showed that the two-dimensional monolayer self-assembled structures on the atomically flat surfaces can be controlled by the peripheral alkyl chain substitution patterns.

All of the reactants, intermediates, transition states and product were optimized at B3LYP/6-31+ G(d) level. The single point energy and zero point energy correction were calculated for the optimized configuration of each compound at B3LYP/6-311+ +G(d,p) level. Transition states have been confirmed via vibration analysis and intrinsic reactions coordinate (MC), and nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analysis orbits interaction and bond natures. Our results showed that the activation energy of the rate-determining step was 514.32 kJ center dot mol(-1) without I-2-catalyzed, however, the activation energy of the rate-determining step was 145.94 kJ.mol(-1) with I-2-catalyzed. It indicated that I-2 catalyst promoted reaction effectively, and the C H bond of ethyl of phenylacetaldehyde was activated by I-2. In addition, polarized continuum model (PCM) method was adopted to discuss the effects of solvation. All calculations were consistent with experiments. It is predicted that the organic solvent dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) can effectively improve the reaction yield.

Results show that the P-1-IrB structure is stable, and the incompressibility is enhanced with the increase of pressure. And the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus for P-5-IrB2 structure exhibit the regular changes under the hydrostatic pressures from 0 to 100 GPa. But when the pressure becomes 50 GPa, the Young's modulus and the lattice constant in the direction b for P-5-IrB2 structure will change exceptionally. Results show that both are not of obvious band gaps in P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 electronic structures under zero pressure, because of the covalent effect between Ir and B atoms. The analysis of band structure and the figure of density of states for P-1-IrB and P-5-IrB2 indicate that the two kinds of structure have metal properties.

This study aimed to ascertain whether addition of Se can produce rice with enriched Se and lowered Hg content when growing in Hg-contaminated paddy fields and, if so, to determine the possible mechanisms behind these effects. Methods Two cultivars of rice (Oryza sativa, japonica and indica) were grown in either hydroponic solutions or soil rhizobags with different Se and Hg treatments. Concentrations of total Hg, MeHg and Se were determined in the roots, shoots and brown rice, together with Hg uptake kinetics and Hg bioavailability in the soil. Root anatonmy was also studied. Key Results The high Se treatment (5 mu g g(-1)) significantly increased brown rice yield by 48% and total Se content by 2.8-fold, and decreased total Hg and MeHg by 47 and 55 %, respectively, compared with the control treatments. The high Se treatment also markedly reduced 'water-soluble' Hg and MeHg concentrations in the rhizosphere soil, decreased the uptake capacity of Hg by roots and enhanced the development of apoplastic barriers in the root endodermis. Conclusions Addition of Se to Hg-contaminated soil can help produce brown rice that is simultaneously enriched in Se and contains less total Hg and MeHg. The lowered accumulation of total Hg and MeHg appears to be the result of reduced bioavailability of Hg and production of MeHg in the rhizosphere, suppression of uptake of Hg into the root cells and an enhancement of the development of apoplastic barriers in the endodermis of the roots.

It is found that the effect of the negative spherical aberration on the on-axis scintillation index is quite different from that of the positive spherical aberration. In weak turbulence, the positive spherical aberration results in a decrease of the on-axis scintillation index on propagation, but the negative spherical aberration results in an increase of the on-axis scintillation index when the propagation distance is not large. In particular, in weak turbulence the negative spherical aberration may cause peaks of the on-axis scintillation index, and the peaks disappear in moderate and strong turbulence, which is explained in physics. The strong turbulence leads to less discrepancy among scintillations of Gaussian beams with and without spherical aberration. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Xie, ZW; Shi, DZ; Lv, HX				Xie, ZhengWei; Shi, De Zheng; Lv, HouXiang			Spin-dependent delay time in ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet heterostructures	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							TRAVERSAL TIME; DWELL TIME	We study theoretically spin-dependent group delay and dwell time in ferromagnet/insulator/ferromagnet (FM/I/FM) heterostructure. The results indicate that, when the electrons with different spin orientations tunnel through the FM/I/FM junction, the spin-up process and the spin-down process are separated on the time scales. As the self-interference delay has the spin-dependent features, the variations of spin-dependent dwell-time and spin-dependent group-delay time with the structure parameters appear different features, especially, in low incident energy range. These different features show up as that the group delay times for the spin-up electrons are always longer than those for spin-down electrons when the barrier height or incident energy increase. In contrast, the dwell times for the spin-up electrons are longer (shorter) than those for spin-down electrons when the barrier heights (the incident energy) are under a certain value. When the barrier heights (the incident energy) exceed a certain value, the dwell times for the spin-up electrons turn out to be shorter (longer) than those for spin-down electrons. In addition, the group delay time and the dwell time for spin-up and down electrons also relies on the comparative direction of magnetization in two FM layers and tends to saturation with the thickness of the barrier.

It is shown that both for the positive and negative-spherical aberrated beams, the intensity distribution is multi-annular in free space, but it becomes a Gaussian-like profile in turbulence. The positive spherical aberration results in a beam spreading, while the negative spherical aberration causes a beam focusing. The larger the positive spherical aberration, the worse the power in the bucket. However, the dependence of the negative spherical aberration on the power in the bucket is non-monotonic. In particular, the effect of spherical aberration on beam spreading decreases due to turbulence.

Here, pelage color variants of the two sibling species (Sorex cylindricauda and Sorex bedfordiae) were uncovered in different sampling sites. Our data may initiate new interest to pelage color variants in small mammals. Furthermore, the classification of two striped shrews has been controversial for several decades. We conducted a detailed examination of the morphometric characters for the two sibling shrews. Significant differences between the two species morphologically confirmed the two-species classification status.

It is shown that when a spatially coherent plane light wave is scattered from two entirely different media, the far-zone spectral density may have identical distribution provided the low-frequency antidiagonal spatial Fourier components of the correlation function of the media are the same. An example of light waves on scattering from a Gaussian Schell model medium is discussed, and the condition on which two different media may produce identical spectral densities is presented.

Removal of isopropyl alcohol (IPA) in UPW by synergistic photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption	CANADIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						isopropyl alcohol; granule activated carbon; nitrogen doped titanium dioxide; photocatalytic oxidation; adsorption	VOLATILE ORGANIC-COMPOUNDS; ACTIVATED CARBON GAC; NITROGEN-DOPED TIO2; WASTE-WATER; DEGRADATION; CONTAMINANTS; COMPOSITE; SYSTEM	Earlier work showed that the commercial granular activated carbon (GAC) could effectively remove large non-polar molecules, but showed poor removal efficiency for small polar compounds such as isopropyl alcohol (IPA) [Schmotzer et al. Clean Technol. Environ. Policy 2002;4:125; Cong et al. J. Phys. Chem. C 2007;111:6976]. To achieve the goal of increasing the lifetime and removal efficiency of GAC bed for small polar organic compounds in ultrapure water (UPW), the synergistic partial photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption system using commercial GAC coated with nitrogen doped titanium dioxide as an adsorbate was proposed in this work. The influence of operating factors such as UV intensity, flow rate, feed concentration, and the sudden injection of air or inorganic acid on IPA removal efficiency was systematically investigated. Compared to the traditional GAC adsorption bed, at feed total organic carbon (TOC) concentration of 800ppb, the lifetime of GAC bed in this synergistic photocatalytic oxidation and adsorption system was extended from 348 to 600min and the outlet TOC concentration was decreased from 793 to 499ppb. The difference of the TOC outlet concentration in those two configurations was attributed to the photocatalytic effect by GAC coated with nitrogen doped titanium dioxide. The reactions between oxidation radicals and organic contaminants caused the majority of IPA to be decomposed into secondary organic compounds such as acetone and acetone had already been shown a higher affinity to GAC than that of IPA. Experiments also demonstrated the injection of air or inorganic acid in the stream would facilitate the removal of IPA in UPW.

Development of the field requires candidate systems with both a high carrier mobility and, in contrast to graphene, a sufficiently large electronic bandgap. Here we present a detailed theoretical investigation of the atomic and electronic structure of few-layer black phosphorus (BP) to predict its electrical and optical properties. This system has a direct bandgap, tunable from 1.51 eV for a monolayer to 0.59 eV for a five-layer sample. We predict that the mobilities are hole-dominated, rather high and highly anisotropic. The monolayer is exceptional in having an extremely high hole mobility (of order 10,000 cm(2)V(-1)s(-1)) and anomalous elastic properties which reverse the anisotropy. Light absorption spectra indicate linear dichroism between perpendicular in-plane directions, which allows optical determination of the crystalline orientation and optical activation of the anisotropic transport properties. These results make few-layer BP a promising candidate for future electronics.

The spreading is less affected by atmospheric turbulence (AT) when z<z(T), while the spreading is dominated by AT when z>z(TT). The dependence of z(T) and z(TT) on the turbulence parameters and the beam parameters is studied in detail. It is Found that both z(T) and z(TT) reach their minimums when the fractal constant of the atmospheric power spectrum is equal to 3.11. However, the dependence of z(TT) On turbulence parameters and beam parameters is much larger than that of zT. There exists a minimum of zT versus the waist width, but z(TT) decreases monotonically as the waist width increases. On the other hand, the relation between the turbulence distance z(T) and the Rayleigh range z(R) is investigated, It is shown that z(T)=z(R) may appear when a suitable waist width or a suitable coherent parameter is chosen. For the small free-space diffraction (FD) case z(T)<z(R) may hold, but for the large FD case it may be z(T)>z(R). Some physical explanations for the results obtained in this paper are also given.

It is well-known that there exists a self-dual normal basis of F-2(n) over F-2 if and only if 4 dagger n. In this paper, we prove that there exists a normal element alpha of F-2(n)= over F-2 corresponding to a prescribed vector a = (a(0), a(1), . . . , a(n-1)) is an element of F-2(n) such that a(i) = Tr-2(n)vertical bar 2(alpha(1+22)) for 0 <= i <= n - 1, where n is a 2-power or odd, if and only if the given vector a is symmetric (a(i) = a(n-i) for all i, 1 <= i <= n-1), and one of the following is true. [GRAPHICS] Furthermore we give an algorithm to obtain normal elements corresponding to prescribed vectors in the above two cases. For a general positive integer n with 4 vertical bar n, some necessary conditions for a vector to be the corresponding vector of a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 are given. And for all n with 4 vertical bar n, we prove that there exists a normal element of F-2(n) over F-2 such that the Hamming weight of its corresponding vector is 3, which is the lowest possible Hamming weight.

The electromagnetic wave propagates in the z-axis direction with a frequency of 2.45 GHz, and the intensity of the E/H field is 3.4 x 10(4) V/m. The results indicate that as the concentration of the electrolyte solution increased, the electrical conductivity gradually increased, but the hydrogen bonds number and the coordination number decreased.

The genealogy identifies a highly divergent, unnamed lineage from Qixiling Nature Reserve, Jiangxi, China and places it as the sister taxon of P. chinensis. The newly discovered population differs from other congeners by several features of external morphology including having large clusters of dark brown conical warts on the dorsum of the head, lateral surface of the body and dorsolateral ridges. Its intermittent dorsal vertebral ridge is the same color as other parts of the dorsum and tail narrows gradually from the base to the tip. Further, the new population differs from all congeners by an uncorrected P-distance of more than 9.38% in ND2. Consequently, we describe the new species of Asian warty newt (Salamandridae) as Paramesotriton qixilingensis sp. nov.

The co-catalytic effect of the ligand benzotriazole (BtH) was analyzed in details based on a previous experiment reported by Verma that a general and efficient C-S coupling reaction by means of inexpensive catalysts CuI/BtH (Verma et al., 2007). In order to provide comparative data, the structures have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d) level in the gas phase and in solution, N,N-dimethyl formamide being the solvent. Our calculated results interpreted that the ligand of BtH can significantly promote the C-S coupling reaction, i.e., reduce the energy barriers in the steps of the C-S coupling and the CuBr dissociation. Furthermore, the mechanism we proposed can be extended to other C-S coupling reaction catalyzed by Cu(I) complexes. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The dielectric spectra of DMF-water mixture with an asymmetric shape are observed. The mixture behavior is described according to the Cole-Davidson model using four parameters (epsilon(infinity), epsilon(0), tau and beta). The number of hydrogen bonds between the water-water and DMF-water pairs is estimated from the values of the static dielectric constant by using the Luzar model. The model provides a satisfactory explanation of the experimental results related to the static dielectric constant. The hydrogen bond binding energies for water-water (pair 11) and DMF-water (pair 12) are estimated to be 13.01 and 13.10 kJ/mol, we report a new strategy to parameterize effective DMF-water cluster interactions to provide valuable insights into the underlying mechanism of the relaxation acts.

The transcriptome profiles of G. neofelifaecis NRRL B-59395 grown with cholesterol, androstenedione (AD), and pyruvic acid were compared by RNA-Seq. The sterol catabolic genes are highly conserved in G. neofelifaecis, Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The RNA-Seq results indicated that the genes involved in the sterol side chain cleavage were exclusively induced by cholesterol, while the genes involved in the degradation of rings A/B and C/D were up-regulated by both cholesterol and AD. It appears that the induction mechanisms for the genes responsible for side chain cleavage and those for degradation of rings are different. There are approximately 21 genes encoding transporter proteins that are differentially expressed in cholesterol or AD compared with pyruvic acid. The genes camABCD and camM encode two systems that take up cholate, and they have been shown to be cholesterol-and AD-inducible. The potential biological functions of other differentially expressed genes are also discussed. These results will promote the functional characterization of the sterol catabolic genes and also provide important clues in understanding the mechanisms of their gene expression, and they may help us understand the mechanism underlying microbial cholesterol catabolism.

First-principles study of the structural, optical and thermal properties of AgGaSe2	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						density functional theory; optical properties; thermal properties	CHALCOPYRITE; CRYSTALS; DYNAMICS	We have calculated the structural, optical and thermal properties of an AgGaSe2 crystal using ultrasoft pseudopotentials and the generalized gradient approximation ( GGA). The calculated results are in good agreement with the available experimental data and theoretical values. The optical property calculations are performed for the energy range 0-22.5 eV. The thermal properties of the AgGaSe2 are calculated using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The pressure and temperature dependences of the bulk modulus, the heat capacity, the Gruneisen parameter, the Debye temperature and the thermal expansion coefficient, as well as the entropy, are obtained in the ranges of 0-6 GPa and 0-1200 K. We also found in our present work that the effects of pressure and temperature on different thermal properties are significant and very useful for crystal growth.	[Hou, H. J.; Yang, S.

For Gaussian array beams, the analytical expressions of z(c) are derived. For the coherent combination, z(c) is larger than that for the incoherent combination. However, in non-Kolmogorov turbulence, the cross point disappears, and the Gaussian array beams will have the same directionality in terms of the angular spread. Furthermore, a short propagation distance is needed to reach the same directionality when the generalized exponent is equal to 3.108. In particular, it is shown that the condition obtained in previous studies is not necessary for laser beams to have the same directionality in turbulence, which is explained physically. On the other hand, the relative average intensity distributions at the position where the Gaussian array beams have the same mean-squared beam width are also examined.

The ceramics can be well sintered at the wide low sintering temperature range 930 degrees C-990 degrees C and possess a pure perovskite structure. The ceramics with x/y=0.01-0.02/1.0 sintered at 960 degrees C possess high resistivity (similar to 2x109 center dot cm), strong ferroelectricity (Pr=19.1-20.4m/cm2), good piezoelectric properties (d33=127-128pC/N, kp=36.6%-36.9%), and very high Curie temperature (618 degrees C-636 degrees C). The increase in sintering temperature improves the densification, electric insulation, ferroelectric, and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. A small amount of Sc doping (x0.04) and the increase in the sintering temperature significantly enhance the ferromagnetic properties of the ceramics. Improved ferromagnetism with remnant magnetization Mr of 0.059 and 0.10emu/g and coercive field Hc of 2.51 and 2.76kOe are obtained in the ceramics with x/y=0.04/1.0 (sintered at 960 degrees C) and 0.02/1.0 (sintered at 1050 degrees C), respectively. Because of the high TC (636 degrees C), the ceramic with x/y=0.02/1.0 shows good temperature stability of piezoelectric properties. Our results also show that the addition of MnO2 is essential to obtain the ceramics with good electrical properties and electric insulation.

The analytical expressions for the centroid position deviation gamma, the average intensity, the mean-squared beam width and the far-field divergence angle at the receiver plane are derived. It is found that tilted and off-axis active detection laser beams cannot be reflected back by a cat-eye optical lens in the direction of the source. The absolute deviation decreases as the beam coherence decreases. Therefore, partially coherent beams are more suitable as active detection laser beams than fully coherent ones. In addition, decreases greatly due to the aperture effect, and the influence of turbulence on is not monotonic. On the other hand, the influence of the beam coherence and the atmospheric turbulence on the average intensity, the mean-squared beam width and the far-field divergence angle at the receiver plane is also examined, and some interesting results are obtained. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for applications of the active laser detection.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure and no second phases can be detected. After the addition of a small amount of Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (x a parts per thousand currency sign 0.05), the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are improved and the grain growth is promoted. However, excess Bi(Zn0.5Ti0.5)O-3 (x a parts per thousand yen 0.10) retards the grain growth, degrades the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity, and induces two dielectric anomalies at high temperature. The ceramics can be well sintered at the very wide range of low sintering temperatures (880-980 A degrees C) and exhibit good densification (relative density: 96.2-98.4 %) and strong electric insulation. The increase in the sintering temperature promotes the grain growth and improves the ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 0.05 sintered at 880-980 A degrees C possesses improved ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties with remanent polarizations P (r) of 21.9-28.1 mu m/cm(2), piezoelectric constants d (33) of 125-139 pC/N and planar electromechanical coupling factors k (p) of 30.1-32.4 %, and high Curie temperatures T (C) of 523-565 A degrees C. A weak ferromagnetism with remanent magnetizations M (r) of 0.0411-0.0422 emu/g and coercive fields H (c) of 1.70-1.99 kOe were observed in the ceramics with x = 0-0.025.

The sample consisted of 51 Caucasian-Australians, 51 people of Chinese heritage living in Australia (PCHA) and 51 Mainland Chinese. Participants were required to identify the emotions of happiness, sadness, fear, anger, surprise and disgust displayed in photographs of Caucasian and Chinese faces. The PCHA group also responded to an acculturation measure that assessed their adoption of Australian cultural values and adherence to heritage (Chinese) cultural values. Counter to the hypotheses, the Caucasian-Australian and PCHA groups were found to be significantly more accurate at identifying both the Chinese and Caucasian facial expressions than the Mainland Chinese group. Adoption of Australian culture was found to predict greater accuracy in recognising the emotions displayed on Caucasian faces for the PCHA group.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Quantitative information architecture, granular computing and rough set models in the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Double quantification; Quantitative information architecture; Variable precision rough set; Graded rough set	INCLUSION DEGREE; REDUCTION; RULES; BETA	Because precision and grade act as fundamental quantitative information in approximation space, they are used in relative and absolute quantifications, respectively. At present, the double quantification regarding precision and grade is a novel and valuable subject, but quantitative information fusion has become a key problem. Thus, this paper constructs the double-quantitative approximation space of precision and grade (PG-Approx-Space) and tackles the fusion problem using normal logical operations. It further conducts double-quantification studies on granular computing and rough set models. (1) First, for quantitative information organization and storage, we construct space and plane forms of PG-Approx-Space using the Cartesian product, and for quantitative information extraction and fusion, we establish semantics construction and semantics granules of PG-ApproxSpace. (2) Second, by granular computing, we investigate three primary granular issues: quantitative semantics, complete system and optimal calculation. Accordingly, six types of fundamental granules are proposed based on the semantic, microscopic and macroscopic descriptions; their semantics, forms, structures, calculations and relationships are studied, and the granular hierarchical structure is achieved. (3) Finally, we investigate rough set models in PG-Approx-Space. Accordingly, model regions are proposed by developing the classical regions, model expansion is systematically analyzed, some models are constructed as their structures are obtained, and a concrete model is provided. Based on the quantitative information architecture, this paper systematically conducts and investigates double quantification and establishes a fundamental and general exploration framework.

J	Tang, Y; Newman, LS; Huang, LH				Tang, Ying; Newman, Leonard S.; Huang, Lihui			How People React to Social-Psychological Accounts of Wrongdoing The Moderating Effects of Culture	JOURNAL OF CROSS-CULTURAL PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						cultural psychology; social judgment; attribution; culture; perception	ATTRIBUTION; SKEPTICISM; AGENCY	While social-psychological research has afforded much insight into the causes of human behavior, its emphasis on "the power of the situation" has been met with resistance from laypeople. Previous research found that American participants, when provided with different accounts of wrongdoing, were comfortable endorsing dispositional explanations of the behavior, but suspected that psychologists were exonerating wrongdoers when they were provided with situational explanations. The current study extends this research by examining the moderating effect of culture on laypeople's perceptions of different explanations of wrongdoing. Chinese and American participants read about two hypothetical studies about wrongdoing and learned that either situational factors or personality variables seemed to account for the behavior. They then made responsibility attributions for the wrongdoer from both their own perspective and from what they perceived was the psychologists' perspective. When given dispositional explanations, both Chinese and Americans reported consistency between their own and what they perceived to be the psychologists' perspectives. However, when given situational explanations, although Chinese participants again reported consistency between their own and the psychologists' perspectives, American participants thought the psychologists were exonerating the wrongdoer. These findings shed light on why social-psychological research sometimes faces skepticism and on cross-cultural variations in how people explain human behaviors. Practical implications of the study include a reminder that when social psychologists package their messages, they should take into account the biases of different targeted audiences.

Structure, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of Ba0.90Ca0.10Ti1-xSnxO3 lead-free ceramics	CERAMICS INTERNATIONAL			English	Article						BaTiO3-based; Sn-substitution; Piezoelectricity; Dielectric property	BARIUM-TITANATE CERAMICS; SIZE	Lead-free piezoelectric ceramics Ba0.90Ca0.10Ti1-xSnxO3 have been prepared by a conventional ceramic fabrication technique and the effects of Sn4+ on the structure, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics have been investigated. All the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure. After the substitution of Sn4+, the crystal structure of ceramics is transformed gradually from a tetragonal to an orthorhombic phase, and becomes a pseudo-cubic phase at x >= 0.14. The substitution also decreases the Curie temperature greatly from 138 degrees C at x=0 to 33 degrees C at x=0.12, and shifts the orthorhombic- tetragonal phase transition to higher temperatures. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed in the ceramic at x=0.10, leading to significant improvements in the piezoelectric properties: d(33)=521 pC/N and k(p)=45.5%. Our results also reveal that the ceramics sintered at higher temperatures contain larger grains, and thus exhibit more noticeable tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition and enhanced ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties.

In this paper, we settle a question raised by Mahdou and Tamekkante in [On (strongly) Gorenstein (semi) hereditary rings, Arab. J. Sci. Eng. 36 (2011) 436] about the coherence of G-hereditary rings. It is shown that a ring R is Gorenstein semihereditary if and only if every finitely generated submodule of a projective module is Gorenstein projective. As a consequence of this result, we have that every G-hereditary ring R is coherent.

We show that if the module M is LCM-stable over a GCD-domain R, then the polynomial module M[X] is LCM-stable over R[X]; if R is a w-coherent locally GCD-domain, then LCM-stability and reflexivity are equivalent for w-finite type torsion-free R-modules. Finally, we introduce the concept of w-LCM-stability for modules over a domain. Then we characterize when the module M is w-LCM-stable over the domain in terms of localizations and t-Nagata modules, respectively. Also we characterize Prufer v-multiplication domains and Krull domains in terms of w-LCM-stability.

Based on an exact analytical and numerical analysis, we demonstrated that the beating of the screened potential as well as the undamped plasmon mode can be taken as fingerprints of a topological phase transition in doped silicene and doped germanene. Thus our proposal here establishes the connection between the topological phase transition and the density oscillations that can be accessed by a variety of experimental techniques.

J	Wan, Y; Zheng, QJ; Lin, DM				Wan Yang; Zheng Qiaoji; Lin Dunmin			Recent Development of LiMnPO4 as Cathode Materials of Lithium-ion Batteries	ACTA CHIMICA SINICA			Chinese	Review						LiMnPO4; Jahn-Teller effect; thermal stability; morphology; synthesis processes; surface coating; doping	CARBON-COATED LIMNPO4; ELECTROCHEMICAL PROPERTIES; HIGH-PERFORMANCE; LIMPO4 M; ELECTRODE MATERIALS; THERMAL-STABILITY; HYDROTHERMAL SYNTHESIS; NANOCOMPOSITE CATHODE; PHASE-TRANSFORMATION; DEFECT CHEMISTRY	Similar to LiFePO4, LiMnPO4 possesses the following advantages: eco-friendliness, low cost and excellent safety performance. Moreover, high energy density (similar to 700 Wh.kg(-1)) of LiMnPO4 is 20% larger than LiFePO4, which is due to LiMnPO4 with high operating voltage similar to 4.1 V vs. Li falling within the electrochemical stability window of conventional electrolyte solutions. Therefore, LiMnPO4 is considered as a next generation cathode material for lithium-ion batteries. However, the lithium ion conductivity of LiMnPO4 is lower than that of LiFePO4. The main difference between the kinetics in the initial stage of charging of two olivine materials may originate from the formation energy of vacancy-polaron complex in LiMnPO4 than in LiFePO4. In addition, the anisotropic lattice distortion of Mn06 octahedron during repeated charge/discharge process hinders lithium removal/uptake reactions in LiMnPO4 and thus leads to the large volume change. This distortion is not a strict Jahn-Teller effect but is a preferential elongation of two of the equatorial Mn-O bonds (edge-sharing with the PO4). These intrinsic defects result in rapid capacity fading upon extended cycling and poor rate capability during cycles. To overcome these problems, it is an effective approach to prepare nanometer-sized and rod/sheet-like materials through proper synthesis method. These special morphologies in LiMnPO4 can stimulate the rate of Li extraction/insertion. However, the surface structural instability of particles may occur at size d<35 nm. The awkward situation may be solved by effective surface coating. Surface coating can decrease the disorder toward amorphous state and the poison of impurities on the surface of particles; especially, coating can promote the ionic and electronic conductivity. Therefore, a coating leads to a remarkable improvement of the electrochemical performance of LiMnPO4. In addition, doping is also a method for improving the electrochemical property of LiMnPO4. As a Fe-doped material, LiMnyFe1-yPO4 has been widely investigated. In this paper, the recent advances in LiMnPO4 as cathode materials of lithium-ion batteries are reviewed. The characteristics, morphologies, and possible reaction mechanisms of the material were summarized systematically. Some open questions (e.g. the facticity of Jahn-Teller effect in LiMnPO4, the thermal stability of LiMnPO4, etc.) are discussed in detail. Moreover, some improved methods, (controlling the particle morphology, surface coating, and doping) for the electrochemical property of LiMnPO4 are expounded.

Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that both strains were members of the genus Oceanobacillus and most closely related to Oceanobacillus chironomi LMG 23627(T) with pairwise sequence similarity of 96.0%. The isolates contained menaquinone-7 (MK-7) as the respiratory quinone and anteiso-C-15:0, anteiso-C-17:0 and iso-C-15:0 as the major fatty acids (>10%). Polar lipids consisted of a predominance of diphosphatidylglycerol and moderate to minor amounts of phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylinositol. The cell-wall peptidoglycan contained meso-diaminopimelic acid. The DNA G C content was 38.6-39.2 molok. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain WW1 T displayed 99.7% similarity to that of strain WM-4, and DNA-DNA hybridization between the two strains showed a relatedness value of 91 %. Based on the results of this polyphasic study, strains WM-1(T) and WM-4 represent a novel species in the genus Oceanobacillus, for which the name Oceanobacillus luteolus sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-1(T) (=KCTC 33119(T)=CGMCC 1.12406(T)).

Cells of strain DX-1(T) were oxidase-positive, catalase-positive and Gram-staining-negative. The strain was found to be rod-shaped and non-Motile and to produce subterminal spores. The strain was able to grow with NaCl at concentrations ranging from 0 to 6%, at temperatures of 25-60 degrees C (optimum 55 degrees C) and pH 6.0-8.0 (optimum pH 7.0). Phylogenetic analyses based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strain DX-1(T) formed a cluster with Ureibacillus thermosphaericus DSM 10633(T) (96.9% 16S rRNA sequence similarity), Ureibacillus composti DSM 17951(T) (95.8%), Ureibacillus thermophilus DSM 17952(T) (95.7%) and Ureibacillus terrenus DSM 12654(T) (95.3%). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 40.4 mol%. The major quinone was MK-7, the peptidoglycan type was L-Lys <--D-Asp, and the major cellular fatty acids (>5%) were iso-C-16:0, and iso-C-14:0. The polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylglycerol, diphosphatidylglycerol and phospholipids of unknown composition. Based on phenotypic characteristics, chemotaxonomic features and results of phylogenetic analyses, the strain was determined to represent a distinct novel species of the genus Ureibacillus, and the name proposed for the novel species is Ureibacillus defluvii sp. nov., with type strain DX-1(T) (=CGMCC 1.12358(T)= KCTC 33127(T)).

A pioneering video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation and space-time regularisation	IMAGING SCIENCE JOURNAL			English	Article						Video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm; Segmentation; Image mosaic; Bilateral total variation; Space-time regularisation		In view of the common existing problems in present video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction, this paper proposes a pioneering video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation and space-time regularisation to solve these problems. First, a video-to-video super-resolution reconstruction algorithm based on segmentation is proposed to eliminate reconstructed temporal ringing and to improve the times of reconstruction. Second, considering that image mosaic is involved in our proposed reconstruction algorithm, an improved fade-in and fade-out method is proposed to make the mosaic image looks more natural. At last, an improved space-time regularisation algorithm is put forward to remove noise and preserve image edge at the same time. Using several experiments, we prove that the proposed algorithm can achieve state-of-the -art reconstruction effect.	[Guo, L.; He, X. H.; Qing, L.

Many researchers have been studying the objective quality assessment method based on human visual system. Recently, the single-scale feature-similarity index metric has been proposed to provide a good approximation to perceived image quality. However, this metric does not take into account the fact that features in a certain scale cannot reflect various distorted details in the image. To address this issue, this paper proposes a multi-scale structural image quality assessment based on two-stage low-level features, which supplies more flexible than previous single-scale method by incorporating the variations of viewing conditions and resolution. In this multi-scale framework, different weights are assigned to various scales with different levels of importance. Extensive experiments on the five public benchmark databases indicate that the proposed metric is more consistent with the subjective evaluations than all the other competing methods evaluated.

An R-module M is said to be w-projective if Ext(R)(1)(M, N) is GV-torsion for any torsion-free w-module N. In this paper, we define a ring R to be w-semi-hereditary if every finite type ideal of R is w-projective. To characterize w-semihereditary rings, we introduce the concept of w-injective modules and study some basic properties of w-injective modules. Using these concepts, we show that R is w-semi-hereditary if and only if the total quotient ring T(R) of R is a von Neumann regular ring and R-m is a valuation domain for any maximal w-ideal m of R. It is also shown that a connected ring R is w-semi-hereditary if and only if R is a Pri Her v-multiplication domain.

It is shown that turbulence results in beam spreading, and the effect of spherical aberration on the beam spreading decreases due to turbulence. Gaussian beams with negative spherical aberration are more affected by turbulence than those with positive spherical aberration. For the negative spherical aberration case, the focus position moves to the source plane due to turbulence. It is mentioned that the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability defined by a certain energy (i.e. PIB = 63%) is very heavy when the negative spherical aberration is very heavy. On the other hand, the influence of turbulence on the energy focusability defined by the energy within a given bucket radius (i.e. mean-squared beam width) is heaviest when a certain negative spherical aberration coefficient is adopted.

We here investigate the reverse process of optimal universal 1 -> 2 telecloning of arbitrary two-qubit states. The aim of this telecloning is to distribute respectively the quantum information to two groups of spatially separated receivers from a group of two senders situated at two different locations.

The OAEPCT is different from the reverse process of optimal universal telecloning. It is shown that the quantum information via 1 -> 3 OAEPCT procedure can be remotely concentrated back to a single qubit with a certain probability via several quantum channels.

(2004) studied a class of inventory games which arise when a group of retailers who observe demand for a common item decide to cooperate and make joint orders with the EOQ policy. In this paper, we extend their model to the situation where retailer's delay in payments is permitted by the supplier. We introduce the corresponding inventory game with permissible delay in payments, and prove that its core is nonempty. Then, a core allocation rule is proposed which can be reached through population monotonic allocation scheme. Under this allocation rule, the grand coalition is shown to be stable from a farsighted point of view. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Calculated structures and band gaps of these alloys are in good agreement with available experimental and other theoretical values. Present results show that the prominent peaks of the dielectric functions and absorption coefficients have a slight red shift and the amplitudes become larger with the increasing concentration of Cd and Se. Moreover, present findings predict that Zn1-xCdxS and ZnS1-ySey alloys are promising for solar cells and photoconductor and electroluminescent devices due to their high absorption of solar radiations and photoconductivity in the energy region from visible light to ultraviolet.

The calculated values at zero pressure are in good agreement with experiments and similar theoretical calculations. Among them, the mechanism of the high pressure induced structural phase transition of RhSi has been studied in a detailed fashion. Under compression, the theoretical calculations show that RhSi will undergo a structural phase transition from B31-phase to B20-phase at 5.59 GPa. Based on the semiempirical method of the evaluation of covalent crystal, the hardness H-v of RhSi is estimated under high pressure. Remarkably, the theoretical results suggest that at zero pressure, the hardness value of B31-RhSi is 14.8 GPa and that of B20-RhSi is 19.0 GPa. (C) 2014 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

Our calculation indicates that the orthorhombic phase with Pnnm symmetry is the most energetically stable one. The other four new dynamically stable phases belong to space groups monoclinic C2/m, orthorhombic Pmmn, trigonal R (3) over barm, and hexagonal P6(3)/mmc. Their mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities are verified by calculating elastic constants, formation enthalpies, and phonon dispersions. We found that all phases are stabilized further under pressure. Above the pressure of about 50 GPa, the formation enthalpy of Pmmn is almost equal to that of P6(3)/mmc phase. The analysis on density of states not only demonstrates that formation of strong covalent bonding in these compounds contributes greatly to their stabilities but also that they all exhibit metallic behavior which does not relate to the approach used. By considering metallic contributions, the estimated Vickers hardness values based on the semiempirical model show that the OsB4-structured FeB4, with a hardness of 48.1 GPa, well exceeding the limitation of superhardness (40 GPa), is more hard than the most stable phase. The others are predicted to be potential hard materials. Moreover, the atomic configuration and strong B B covalent bonds are found to play important roles in the hardness of materials.

The integration of learning styles into an intelligent system is a possible solution to the problems of "learning deviation" and "cognitive overload." In this study, we propose a learning style prediction method based on a pattern recognition technique. The main contributions of this method are: (1) it is a form of middleware that can be applied to other intelligent tutoring systems, and (2) it can process topic-dependent data to make predictions and update learning style profiles in a recursive manner. Experimental evaluations demonstrated the effectiveness of this prediction method.

On this basis, the excited states geometry structure was optimized by the CIS method, and finally the fluorescence emission spectra were calculated through the TD-DFT method. The results showed that: the four compounds, a large conjugated system, is preferably coplanar structure. Because of introducing hydroxyl and halogen atom on the benzene ring, the molecular pi-electron conjugation is relatively larger, emission wavelength is relatively longer, and fluorescence spectra show different degrees of red shift. As the electron donating group is hydroxy, the fluorescence phenomenon is more obviously red shifted.

Rietveld analysis reveals that the crystal structure changes from one orthorhombic phase with Pbcm space group to another orthorhombic phase with P222(1) space group when increasing x. The morphotropic phase boundary between two different orthorhombic symmetries is formed at 0.14<x<0.18. Excess LiTaO3 causes an abnormal grain growth behavior. The pure NaNbO3 presents four current peaks in the I-E loop, indicating electric-field-induced transitions. A low LiTaO3 doping induces ferroelectricity in the initially antiferroelectric (AFE) NaNbO3. Enhanced ferroelectricity is obtained at x=0.02-0.12. The addition of LiTaO3 makes the ceramics undergo a transition from an antiferroelectricity dominant to a ferroelectricity dominant phase state. The optimum d(33), k(p), Q(m), and P-r values of 46 pC/N, 18.3%, 1333, and 27.1Ccm(-2) are obtained when x equals 0.12, and the ceramic exhibits good temperature stability because of its high T-C.

A methodology of urban eco-security evaluation has been introduced, including a conceptual framework of pressure-state-response (PSR) model, setting-up of the indicator system of urban eco-security evaluation (ISUESE) and empirical research. By virtue of the mean-deviation method, the weight coefficient of every indicator is confirmed. It has been found that the top three indicators are: per capita area of paved road, per capita area of cultivated land and green coverage rate of built-up area, which has a relatively prominent status in he urban ecological security. A calculation procedure of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) method is applied in empirical research. The Mianyang statistical data during the period of 2005-2012 shows that eco-security keeps a favorable trend, but criticality security and slight insecurity are dominant.

Membership degrees of criticality security and security in environment state are increasing gradually, and as far as environment response is concerned, security is significantly increased.

Thus, it is important to detect glass transition temperature (T (g)) with a sensitive and proper method. Dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA) is one of the most frequently used methods to determine T (g) due to its advantage of high sensibility. However, there is controversy in the past literatures to determine the proper glass transition temperature among three transition temperatures, i.e., T (g1), T (g2) and T (g3) in the dynamic mechanical spectra, which correspond to the temperature abscissa of intersect value of two tangent lines on storage modulus (E'), the peak of the loss modulus (EaEuro(3)) and the peak of the loss tangent (tan delta). In this work, these three transition temperatures were compared with the glass transition temperature determined by DSC (T (gDSC)). Based on the discussion of different modes of molecular motion around the glass transition region, it is demonstrated that T (g1) and T (g2) have the same molecular mechanism as T (gDSC), i.e., local segmental motion which is enthalpic in nature and determines the proper glass transition temperature, while T (g3) is assigned to the transition temperature of entropic Rouse modes, thus cannot be used as the proper glass transition temperature.

Growth occurred with 0-5 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 0-1 %) and at pH 5.0-10.5 (optimum pH 8.5) and 4-40 A degrees C (optimum 30 A degrees C) in Luria-Bertani medium. Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses showed that strain WM-2(T) is a member of the genus Pseudomonas and most closely related to P. guguanensis, P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis, P. toyotomiensis, P. alcaliphila and P. mendocina with 97.1-96.6 % sequence similarities. In terms of gyrB and rpoB gene sequences, strain WM-2(T) showed the highest similarity with the type strains of the species P. toyotomiensis and P. alcaliphila. The DNA-DNA relatedness values of strain WM-2(T) with P. guguanensis and P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis was 48.7 and 37.2 %, respectively. Chemotaxonomic characteristics (the main ubiquinone Q-9, major fatty acids C-18:1 omega 7c/C-18:1 omega 6c, C-16:0 and C-16:1 omega 7c/C-16:1 omega 6c and DNA G+C content 65.2 +/- A 0.7 mol%) were similar to those of members of the genus Pseudomonas. Polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, an unknown aminophospholipid, an unknown phospholipid and five unknown lipids. According to the results of polyphasic analyses, strain WM-2(T) represents a novel species in the genus Pseudomonas, for which the name Pseudomonas sihuiensis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-2(T) (=KCTC 32246(T)=CGMCC 1.12407(T)).

J	Su, H; Kong, AWK				Su, Han; Kong, Adams Wai Kin			A Study on Low Resolution Androgenic Hair Patterns for Criminal and Victim Identification	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY			English	Article						Hair pattern identification; criminal and victim identification; soft biometrics; skin marks		Identifying criminals and victims in images (e.g., child pornography and masked gunmen) can be a challenging task, especially when neither their faces nor tattoos are observable. Skin mark patterns and blood vessel patterns are recently proposed to address this problem. However, they are invisible in low-resolution images and dense androgenic hair can cover them completely. Medical research results have implied that androgenic hair patterns are a stable biometric trait and have potential to overcome the weaknesses of skin mark patterns and blood vessel patterns. To the best of our knowledge, no one has studied androgenic hair patterns for criminal and victim identification before. This paper aims to study matching performance of androgenic hair patterns in low-resolution images. An algorithm designed for this paper uses Gabor filters to compute orientation fields of androgenic hair patterns, histograms on a dynamic grid system to describe their local orientation fields, and the blockwise Chi-square distance to measure the dissimilarity between two patterns. The 4552 images from 283 different legs with resolutions of 25, 18.75, 12.5, and 6.25 dpi were examined. The experimental results indicate that androgenic hair patterns even in low-resolution images are an effective biometric trait and the proposed Gabor orientation histograms are comparable with other well-known texture recognition methods, including local binary patterns, local Gabor binary patterns, and histograms of oriented gradients.

After the addition of Bi(Mg0.5Zr0.5)O-3, the crystal structure of the ceramics is transformed from rhombohedral to tetragonal phase and the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phase is formed at x = 0.01. The grain size of the ceramics increases with x increasing from 0 to 0.02 and then decreases with x further increasing. The dielectric peak of the ceramics becomes diffusive with x increasing after the addition of Bi(Mg0.5Zr0.5)O-3. The ceramics with x = 0-0.08 exhibit much better electric insulation with the resistivity of 1.0 x 10(9)-5.0 x 10(9) Omega center dot cm than pure BiFeO3 ceramic with the resistivity of similar to 5 x 10(7) Omega center dot cm. Due to the formation of the MPB, the ceramics with x = 0-0.02 possess good densification with the relative densities rho (r) of 94.9-96.3 %, strong piezoelectricity with the d (33) of 129-135 pC/N and very high Curie temperature with the T (C) of 559-610 A degrees C.

J	Hou, BP; Chen, J; Pan, YM				Hou, Bang-Pin; Chen, Jing; Pan, Yan-Ming			Decoherence in cross-Kerr nonlinearity based on electromagnetically induced transparency	EUROPEAN PHYSICAL JOURNAL D			English	Article							OPTICAL SOLITONS; ATOMIC SYSTEM; INVERSION; PHOTONS; LIGHT	The effects of decoherence due to dephasing and incoherent population exchange on the cross-Kerr nonlinearity are investigated. In the linear optical behavior, the incoherent population exchange suppresses the linear resonance such as the Autler-Townes absorption and the electromagnetically induced transparency in the same manner as the dephasing. While in the cross-Kerr optical responses these two decoherence mechanisms affect the nonlinearity in different ways. The dephasing enhances the nonlinear absorption at resonance, while the incoherent population exchange leads to cross-nonlinear gain and also broadens its spectrum. In particular, the large cross-Kerr nonlinearity without nonlinear absorption can be realized by suitably adjusting the incoherent population exchange. Additionally, the dependence of y-intercepts of absorption or dispersion curves without control field on the population exchange rate can be used to estimate the incoherent population exchange rate of the system. The results provided here are useful not only for illustrating distinct physical mechanisms of these two kinds of decoherence in nonlinear optics, but also for potential applications of cross-Kerr nonlinearity in quantum information processing.

The BSA prediction has attracted unceasing research back more than a century on animals, especially on humans and rats. Few studies in this area for anurans were reported, and the equation for body surface area (5) and body mass (W): S = 9.9 W-0.56, which was concluded from toads of four species in 1969, was generally adopted to estimate the body surface areas for anurans until recent years. However, this equation was not applicable to Odorrana grahami. The relationship between body surface area and body mass for this species was established as: S = 15.4 W-0.579. Our current results suggest estimation equations should be used cautiously across different species and body surface area predictions on more species need to be conducted.

By means of NMR and EPR spectroscopy, the nature of the Ti species formed in the catalyst systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO, (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, and (FI)TiCl3/AlR3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-) (R = Me, Et, Bu-i) has been studied. It was shown that outer-sphere ion pairs of the type [(FI)(TiMe2)-Me-IV](+)[A](-) ([A](-) = [MeMAO](-), [MeMMAO](-), [B-(C6F5)(4)](-)) are formed at the initial stage of the reaction of (FI)TiCl3 with MAO, MMAO, and AlMe3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-). These ion pairs further partially convert into Ti-III and Ti-II species. In the systems (FI)TiCl3/MAO and (FI)TiCl3/AlMe3/[Ph3C](+)[B(C6F5)(4)](-), complexes with the proposed structures (FI)(TiMe2)-Me-III, (FI)(TiCl)-Cl-II, and [(FI)Ti-II(S)](+)[A](-) ([A](-) = [MeMAO](-), [B(C6F5)(4))](-), S = solvent, vacancy) were observed (concentrations of Ti-III species was lower than those of the Ti-II congeners). In contrast, in the system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO, the concentrations of Ti-II species (ion pairs of the type [(FI)Ti-III(mu-H)(mu-Cl)(AlBu2)-Bu-i](+)[MeMMAO](-)) were higher than those of the Ti-II counterparts (ion pairs [(FI)Ti-II(S)(+)[MeMMAO](-)). The system (FI)TiCl3/MMAO displays lower activity and selectivity in 1-hexene formation, in comparison to (FI)TiCl3/MAO, due to undesirable PE generation. Probably, Ti-II and Ti-IV ion pairs are those participating in ethylene trimerization.

This chart is a self-starting scheme, and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages rather than having to wait for the accumulation of sufficiently large calibration samples. It does not require any prior knowledge of the underlying distribution. The choice of the chart parameters is studied and a simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also efficiently detects various magnitudes of shifts. An illustrative example is also given to introduce the implementation of this proposed control chart.

The mixture behavior is described according to four Davidson-Cole terms whose evolution with composition is analyzed. Numbers of hydrogen bonds and bonding energies between alcohol-alcohol and DMSO-alcohol pairs are estimated from the dielectric constants' using the Luzar model. The average number of hydrogen bonds associated with DMSO decreases with increasing mole fraction of DMSO. The binding energy for alcohol-alcohol (E-11) and DMSO-alcohol (E-12) interactions decreases with the increased numbers of carbon atoms in the alcohols.

In this kind of model, the creation of upper level coherence does not require non-orthogonal dipoles. It is found that due to the microwave-induced coherence, refraction-absorption properties can be controlled by the relative phase of applied fields, and high refractive index without absorption can be always achieved just by choosing proper values of the relative phase.

G. Carter et al., Nat. Photon. 7, 329 (2013)] in an all-optical way. Adopting full quantum theory in real space, we analytically calculate the transport coefficients of single photons scattered by a A-type QD embedded in single-and two-mode photonic crystal cavities (PCCs), respectively. Our numerical results clearly show that the photonic transmission properties can be exactly manipulated by adjusting the coupling strengths of waveguide-cavity and QD-cavity interactions. Specifically, for the PCC with two degenerate orthogonal polarization modes coupled to a A-type QD with two degenerate ground states, we find that the photonic transmission spectra show three Rabi-splitting dips and the present system could serve as single-photon polarization beam splitters. The feasibility of our proposal with the current photonic crystal technique is also discussed.

Structural, optical, and magnetic properties of (Co, Cu)-codoped ZnO films with different Co concentrations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ROOM-TEMPERATURE FERROMAGNETISM; DOPED ZNO; THIN-FILMS; CU; SEMICONDUCTORS; TRANSITION	Zn0.99-xCoxCu0.01O films with different Co concentrations from 0% to 20% were fabricated by a sol-gel method. Moderate Co doping is found to improve the surface uniformity and crystal quality of the films, and causes a redshift of the band edge of Zn(Co, Cu) films. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy reveals that the introduction of Co ions causes the valence state of Cu to change from +2 to +1; while at Co concentrations lower than 10%, the Co exists in the +2 valence state. Strong blue emission at similar to 420 and 440 nm are observed, decreasing with increasing Co concentration, but becoming strong again as the concentration is increased to 20%. Enhanced room-temperature ferromagnetism is observed for the (Co, Cu)-codoped ZnO films at Co concentrations lower than 10%. These interesting magnetic properties are explained based on charge transfer, together with the defect-related model for ferromagnetism. (C) 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.	[Xu, M.; Yuan, H.; Zhou, P.

The first one is how to represent giant data, such as image data, using quantum state without losing information. The second one is how to load a colossal volume of data into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from classical electronic memory. Researches on these two questions are rarely reported. Here an entangled state is used to represent an image (or vector) for which two entangled registers are used to store a vector component and its classical address. Using the representation, n(1) + n(2) + 8 qubits are used to store the whole information of the gray image that has a 2(n1) x 2(n2) size at a superposition of states, a feat is not possible with a classic computer. The way of designing a unitary operation to load data, such as a vector (or image), into the quantum registers of a quantum CPU from electronic memory is defined herein as a quantum loading scheme (QLS). In this paper, the QLS with time complexity O(log(2) N) is presented where N denotes the number of vector components, a solution that would break through the efficiency bottleneck of loading data. QLS would enable a quantum CPU to be compatible with electronic memory and make possible quantum image compression and quantum signal processing that has classical input and output.

All the ceramics show good electric insulation with the resistivity values of 1.97 x 10(9)-1.20 x 10(10) Omega cm. After the addition of Ba-0.6(Bi0.5K0.5)(0.4)TiO3, two dielectric anomalies are observed at high temperatures (T (1) similar to 453-710 A degrees C and T (2) similar to 716-755 A degrees C, respectively). The ceramic with x = 0.275 exhibits the optimum piezoelectricity (d (33) = 48 pC/N and k (p) = 13.6 %, respectively).

The optimized structure of GaSe has been found to be in good agreement with the experimental results. The mechanical stability of epsilon-GaSe is confirmed by calculations of the elastic constants. The calculated band structure shows that the crystal has a direct band gap of 0.816 eV. Furthermore, the linear photon-energy-dependent dielectric functions and some optical constants such as refractive index, extinction, reflectivity and absorption coefficients have been calculated.

By analyzing the variational characteristics of this equation, we established two types of invariant flows. Then approximating this equation by the energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equations with the same initial data and combining the properties of the invariant flows, we obtain the sharp conditions of global existence for this equation.

The obtained formation enthalpies, energy-volume (E-V) curves and enthalpy-pressure (H-P) curves indicate that orthorhombic B31-IrSi is more stable than cubic B20-IrSi at both ambient and pressure conditions. The elastic stiffness constants, bulk moduli, shear moduli, Young's moduli, Poisson's coefficients and elastic anisotropy factors of the two phases IrSi are studied for the first time. The small elastic stiffness constant C-22 of B31-IrSi induces easily compressibility along the b axis. Moreover, based on the Mulliken overlap population analysis, the hardness H-v of B31-IrSi (H-v = 11.9 GPa) and B20-IrSi (H-v = 13.4 GPa) are evaluated. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The Chinese Family Assessment Instrument, originally designed for completion by adolescents, was adapted for completion by parents. A sample of 700 parent dyads of elementary school children (382 girls and 318 boys) completed the adapted questionnaire. Initial factor analyses showed that the existing five-factor structure used for adolescents' responses was not a good fit for these data. Instead, a four-factor solution emerged where the factors were positive family functioning, negative family functioning, tolerance for family members, and parental understanding. This structure was the same for both mothers and fathers. Further studies of the Chinese Family Assessment Instrument parent adaptation are required to test the factor structure that emerged. Following such studies, validation studies will be required.

Five structures are considered, i.e., delta-MON, WC-MoN, NiAs-MoN, NaCl-MoN and CsCl-MoN. The obtained lattice constant, elastic constants are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. delta-MoN phase is found to be energetically the most stable phase closely followed by NiAs-MoN phase at ambient conditions. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, a pressure-induced structural phase transition from delta-MoN to NiAs-MoN is observed. Elastic properties, Poisson's ratio, Debye temperature, and thermal expansion coefficient of MoN under high pressure are derived. Furthermore, the bonding nature of MoN can be described as covalent-like due to hybridization of N and Mo states, together with ionic and metallic characters. Based on Mulliken population analysis, hardness of MoN is evaluated and the obtained results, namely, NiAs-MoN (26.6 GPa) and delta-MoN (24.7 GPa), are consistent with experimental data excellently. Moreover, the hardness of MoN increases with the pressure. This is a first-principles investigation on the structural and thermodynamic properties of MoN, and it still awaits experimental confirmation. (C) 2013 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.

The results showed that the B or P-doped have little impact on the energy gap value (3. 12 eV) of silicon nanocrystals (SiNcs), except that some energy levels will be introduced in the forbidden band. The energy level caused by three-coordinated B-doped SiNcs is E-c - 0. 8 eV, while it is E-v + 0. 2 eV for the three-coordinated P-doped. However, the energy level position is E-v + 0. 4 eV for the four-coordinated B-doped SiNcs, and E-c - 1. 1 eV for the four-coordinated P-doped. Total energy of the system with the four-coordinated doped is lower than that with the three-coordinated doped in the other same conditions. The total energy of SiNcs system lessen when the surface is modified with appropriate ethyl or isopropyl. The total energy decreases with the surface coverage of organo-functional group increasing. But, the calculation can't converge because of too high resistance when the SiNcs surface are grafted with too many organic groups.

In a previous study, the ERD15 gene was shown to be an important regulator of the abscisic acid response and salicylic acid-dependent defense pathway, acting as an important negative regulator of abscisic acid. The complete IbERD15 gene (accession No. KF723428) was isolated by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. The IbERD15 gene contains an open reading frame of 504 bp, encodes a peptide of 167 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 18.725 kDa. The transcript levels of the IbERD15 gene in a variety of tissues were examined by digital gene expression profiling. The roots of the sweet potato were treated by 3 degrees of polyethylene glycol, and the results indicate that the IbERD15 gene might play an important role in the defense response to drought stress. Moreover, the IbERD15 gene was successfully transformed into yeast cells for analysis of drought tolerance in transgenic yeast.	[Chen, S. D.; Ma, Q. Q.; He, B.; Yuan, X.

But the problems of temperature distribution non-uniformity and low power efficiency in the heating process are becoming a new obstacle in the application of microwave chemistry. An optimized microwave oven with two sources is proposed in this paper from the view of feeding system to overcome these disadvantages. As water is usually concerned as important solvent and reactant, a beaker of water is used as heating load in this study. By modeling the process of heating water for 180 s, the standard deviation and the average temperature are compared between the domestic microwave oven and the optimized microwave oven with two sources. As a result, the power is utilized more efficiently as a 20.14% increase can be seen by using the optimized microwave oven under the same microwave power and more uniformity is obtained as a 11.23% increase is performed by the use of the optimized microwave oven under the same heating conditions.

The influence of the essential oil on histological changes and prostaglandin E-2 (PGE(2)), histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) production associated with carrageenan-induced rat paw edema was also investigated. The essential oil (0.5, 0.25, 0.13 ml/kg b.w.) showed significantly inhibition of inflammation along with a dose-dependent manner in the three experimental models. The anti-inflammatory activity of essential oil was occurred both in early and late phase and peaked at 4 h after carrageenan injection. The essential oil resulted in a dose dependent reduction of the paw thickness, connective tissue injury and the infiltration of inflammatory cell. The essential oil also significantly reduced the production of PGE(2), histamine and 5-HT in the exudates of edema paw induced by carrageenan. Both the essential oil and indomethacin resulted relative lower percentage inhibition of histamine and 5-HT than that of PGE(2) at 4 h after carrageenan injection.

In this paper we propose to combine two methods to produce virtual face images for single sample face recognition. We firstly use a symmetry transform to produce symmetrical face images. We secondly use the linear combination of two samples to generate virtual samples. As a result, we convert the special single sample problem into a non-single sample problem. We then use the 2DPCA method to extract features from the samples and use the nearest neighbor classifier to perform classification. Experimental results show that the proposed method can effectively improve the recognition rate of single sample face recognition. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

Methods: From the viewpoint of semiology, demography, surgical treatment and prognosis evaluation, we compared 19 MRI-negative, PET-positive TLE patients to 41 TLE with hippocampal sclerosis patients, and then statistically analyzed the differences between these 2 cohorts. Results: Under intraoperative electrocorticography monitoring, all patients underwent successful standard anterior temporal lobectomy. It appears that there is no significant difference between the surgical outcome of MRI-negative/PET-positive TLE (Engle class I: 68.4%, Engle class I + II:84.2%) and TLE with hippocampal sclerosis (Engle class I: 68.3%, Engle class I + II: 80.5%). The analysis also shows that to some extent MRI-negative, PET-positive TLE might be distinct from TLE with hippocampal sclerosis as a clinical entity, i.e. the former is not a subtype of the latter. History of febrile convulsion and occurrence of secondary generalized tonic-clonic seizure may possibly differentiate them from each other. Conclusion: Successful resective surgery of MRI-negative TLE based on PET can yield similar favorable results to TLE with hippocampal sclerosis. This study demonstrates that with reasonable presurgical workup, such TLE subtypes can be surgically treated without invasive intracranial electrode implantation. (C) 2014 S.

J	He, JY; Li, C; Wu, G				He, Jiao-Yu; Li, Cheng; Wu, Guo			Discovery of potential drugs for human-infecting H7N9 virus containing R294K mutation	DRUG DESIGN DEVELOPMENT AND THERAPY			English	Article						H7N9; neuraminidase; mutation; virtual screening; inhibitor	FREE-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; INFLUENZA-A VIRUS; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NEURAMINIDASE INHIBITORS; HIGH-THROUGHPUT; DOCKING; SIMULATION; RESISTANCE; THERAPY; ALGORITHM	Background: After the first epidemic wave from February through May 2013, the influenza A (H7N9) virus emerged and has followed a second epidemic wave since June 2013. As of June 27, 2014, the outbreak of H7N9 had caused 450 confirmed cases of human infection, with 165 deaths included. The case-fatality rate of all confirmed cases is about 36%, making the H7N9 virus a significant threat to people's health. At present, neuraminidase inhibitors are the only licensed antiviral medications available to treat H7N9 infections in humans. Oseltamivir is the most commonly used inhibitor, and it is also a front-line drug for the threatening H7N9. Unfortunately, it has been reported that patients treated with oseltamivir can induce R294K (Arg294Lys) substitution in the H7N9 virus, which is a rare mutation and can reduce the antiviral efficacy of inhibitors. Even worse, deaths caused by such mutation after oseltamivir treatment have already been reported, indicating that the need to find substitutive neuraminidase inhibitors for currently available drugs to treat drug-resistant H7N9 is really pressing. Materials and methods: First, the structure of H7N9 containing the R294K substitution was downloaded from the Protein Data Bank, and structural information of approved drugs was downloaded from the ZINC (ZINC Is Not Commercial) database. Taking oseltamivir carboxylate as a reference drug, we then filtered these molecules through virtual screening to find out potential inhibitors targeting the mutated H7N9 virus. For further evaluation, we carried out a 14 ns molecular dynamic simulation for each H7N9-drug complex and calculated the binding energy for each candidate drug. Results: We found five inhibitors that could be candidate drugs for treating the mutated H7N9 virus. Docking poses showed these drugs could bind to the virus effectively, with the contribution of hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. With regard to the molecular dynamic simulations, receptor-ligand complexes formed by these candidate drugs were more stable than the one formed by oseltamivir carboxylate. The binding energy of oseltamivir carboxylate was-122.4 kJ/mol, while those for these potential inhibitors were-417.5, -404.7, -372.2, -304.3, and -289.9 kJ/mol, much better than the reference drug. Conclusion: Given the current and future threat of the mutated H7N9 virus, it is urgent that potent drugs and effective antiviral therapeutics be found. Our study therefore is able to complement currently available drugs for influenza A infectors and helps to prevent the ongoing threat of H7N9 virus.

It is shown that the influence of oceanic optical turbulence on propagation of laser beams becomes stronger as tau (ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum) and chi r (rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature) increase and epsilon (rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of fluid) decreases, which is in agreement with the further analysis of oceanic turbulence shown in this paper. Furthermore, it is concluded that propagation of laser beams is more affected by oceanic optical turbulence in abyssal region than that in active region or oceanic surface. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

Reaction of 2-((2-(1H-benzo[d]imidazol-2-yl)-quinolin-8-ylimino)methyl)-4,6-R-1,R-2-phenols (R-1 = R-2 = Bu-t; (LH)-H-2), (R-1 = R-2 = Me; (LH)-H-3) or (R-1 = Me, R-2 = Ad; (LH)-H-4) with [VO(OnPr)(3)] afforded complexes of the type [L2-4VO] (where L-2 = 3, L-3 = 4, L-4 = 5). The molecular structures of 1 to 3 are reported; the metal centre adopts a distorted octahedral, trigonal bipyramidal or square-based pyramidal geometry respectively. In Schlenk line tests, all complexes have been screened as pre-catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene using diethylaluminium chloride (DEAC) as co-catalyst in the presence of ethyltrichloroacetate (ETA), and for the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone in the presence of benzyl alcohol. All pre-catalyst/DEAC/ETA systems are highly active ethylene polymerization catalysts affording linear polyethylene with activities in the range 3000-10 700 g (mol h bar)(-1); the use of methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified MAO as co-catalyst led to poor or no activity. In a parallel pressure reactor, 3-5 have been screened as pre-catalysts for ethylene polymerization in the presence of either DEAC or DMAC (dimethylaluminium chloride) and ETA at various temperatures and for the co-polymerization of ethylene with propylene. The use of DMAC proved more promising with 3 achieving an activity of 63 000 g (mol h bar)(-1) at 50 degrees C and affording UHMWPE (M-w similar to 2 000 000). In the case of the co-polymerization, the incorporation of propylene was 6.9-8.8 mol%, with 3 exhibiting the highest incorporation when using either DEAC or DMAC. In the case of the ring opening polymerization (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone, systems employing complexes 1-5 were virtually inactive at temperatures <110 degrees C; on increasing the CL : V ratio at 110 degrees C, conversions of the order of 80% were achievable.

The one is a small antipodal Vivaldi antenna for a 4.1-20 GHz frequency range, and its dimension is only 34 x 50 mm(2). Another proposed high gain antenna can achieve the maximum gain of 15.2 dBi within its operating band. Measured results of the manufactured antipodal Vivaldi antennas are in good agreement with the simulated ones. Besides the vertical bar S-11 vertical bar, far field radiation pattern, current distribution, phase, gain, and group delay which are important parameters of impulse distortion in ultra-wide band antenna are well analyzed. All results show that the proposed antipodal Vivaldi antennas have better performances and they are well suited for ultra-wide band communications.

Here we investigated whether this interaction between time and number could be modulated by working memory (WM). In experiment 1 participants first memorized a digit and then judged which of the two digits presented in succession were presented for longer (or shorter), with either one or neither of them being the same as the WM digit. The results showed that, when one of two digits was the same as the WM content, the numerical magnitude effect on temporal performance was abolished, whereas the interference effect occurred only when both the two digits were not the same as the WM content. In order to further investigate whether this effect was due to stimuli repetition, we instructed participants in experiment 2 to merely attend to the original digit but not memorize it during a time judgment task. The results did not reveal the modulation of WM content on time number link The WM-based interference effect, however, might reflect decision bias rather than perception illusion. In experiment 3 we eliminated response biases by using equality judgments, and found that WM content had no impact on time number link. Finally, we conducted experiment 4 (comparative duration judgment) and experiment 5 (equality duration judgment) by manipulating WM load, and demonstrated that the WM-based interference effect was relevant to the duration of the WM content solely in comparative judgment. We concluded that the mental association between time and number representation could be modulated by WM at decision level.

The results showed that the water lettuce had higher removal efficiency with low concentrations of livestock wastewater. The removal efficiency of water lettuce for different initial concentrations of livestock wastewater within 8 d was as follows: chemical oxygen demand (CODcr) (68-82%)> NH3-N (57-69%) > TP (27-45%). The speed of purification of water lettuce for CODcr, NH3-N and TP conformed to first order kinetics equations. The water quality indices CODcr, NH3-N and TP had a higher linear correlation with peroxidase (POD) activity (R-2>0.9(2)) than with superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity, which indicates that the main reacting enzyme of water lettuce under high CODcr stress is peroxidase.

By using the THz time domain measure system, the terahertz dispersion characteristics, loss characteristic and energy focusing characteristic of air-core single-layer and dual-layer dielectric tube are obtained. The results show that this type of air-core dielectric tube can realize low dispersion characteristics. Due to the difference of refractive index between two dielectric materials, stronger energy focusing can be achieved in air-core dual-layer dielectric tube.

We focus our attention in the interplay between the quantum interference and the squeezed field on the population distribution. It is shown that an atomic population inversion can be attained on one of the optical transitions due to the SV. Additionally, we show, with the proper value of the relative phase, the SV can also lead to unexpected population inversion on the transition between two different levels. (C) 2014 Elsevier GmbH.

When it is applied to TSP, its runtime is proportional to the squared size of problem.. so as to look less efficient. The following statistical feature is observed during the authors' long-termgene data analysis using ACO: when the data size.. becomes big, local clustering appears frequently. That is, some data cluster tightly in a small area and form a class, and the correlation between different classes is weak. And this feature makes the idea of divide and rule feasible for the estimate of solution of TSP. In this paper an improved ACO algorithm is presented, which firstly divided all data into local clusters and calculated small TSP routes and then assembled a big TSP route with them. Simulation shows that the presented method improves the running speed of ACO by 200 factors under the condition that data set holds feature of local clustering.

Analyzing the difficulties to choose the fractional orders and unsatisfied processing results in signal processing using fractional-order partial differential equations and related methods; we think that the nonzero values of the truncated fractional order derivatives in the smooth regions are major causes for these situations. In order to resolve the problem, the absolute values of truncated parts of the G-L formula are estimated by the median of signal values of the remainder parts, and then the truncated G-L formula is modified by replacing each of the original signal value to the differences of the signal value and the median. Since the sum of the coefficients of the G-L formula is zero, the median correction can reduce the truncated errors greatly to proximate G-L formula better. We also present some simulation results and experiments to support our theory analysis.

J	Peng, J; Chen, XH; Liu, T				Peng, Jian; Chen, Xiaohai; Liu, Tang			A Flow-Partitioned Unequal Clustering Routing Algorithm for Wireless Sensor Networks	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISTRIBUTED SENSOR NETWORKS			English	Article							ENERGY-EFFICIENT	Energy efficiency and energy balance are two important issues for wireless sensor networks. In previous clustering routing algorithms, multihop transmission, sleep scheduling, and unequal clustering are always used to improve energy efficiency and energy balance. In these algorithms, only the cluster heads share the burden of data forwarding in each round. In this paper, we propose a flow-partitioned unequal clustering routing (FPUC) algorithm to achieve better energy efficiency and energy balance. FPUC consists of two phases: clustering and routing. In the clustering phase, the competition radius is computed according to the node density and the distance from sensor nodes to the sink. The sensor nodes that have more residual energy and larger overlapping degree have higher probability to be selected as cluster heads. In the routing phase, each cluster head first finds the gateway nodes and then distributes the data flow to each of its gateway nodes depending on residual energy. After that, each gateway node forwards the data to the next hop with minimum cost. Two metrics called network lifetime and coverage lifetime are used to compare the performance of FPUC with that of the existing ones. Simulation results show that FPUC can achieve longer network lifetime and coverage lifetime than previous algorithms.

The proposed algorithm introduces an adaptive adjustment strategy of the rotation angle and a cooperative learning strategy into quantum genetic algorithm ( called IQGA). An adaptive adjustment strategy of the quantum rotation which is introduced in this study helps improving the convergence speed, search ability, and stability. Cooperative learning enhances the search ability in the high-dimensional solution space by splitting a high-dimensional vector into several one-dimensional vectors. The experimental results demonstrate good performance of the IQGA in solving multilevel thresholding segmentation problem by compared with QGA, GA and PSO.

The results showed that the introduction of electron-drawing group -CF3 and -C3F7 on beta-diketonate made the strongest absorption peak red-shift and the lowest energy absorption blue-shied. Introduction of -OC2H5 on the benzene or pyridine ring made the lowest energy absorption blue-shift. When the -C2H3 was introduced on the benzene or pyridine ring, the lowest energy absorption was red-shifted. Introduction of electron-donating group on beta-diketonate can enlarge their nonlinear optical properties. On the contrary, the introduction of electron-drawing group dropped it down.

Influence of generalized exponent factor alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum and the type of beam combinations on the spreading of Gaussian array beams is studied. It is shown that for both coherent and incoherent combinations, the dependence of z(R), z(T) and theta on alpha is not monotonic. When alpha = 3.108, z(R) and z(T) reach their minima, and theta reaches its maximum. This means that the spreading is largest, and the spreading is enormously affected by turbulence when alpha = 3.108. For the incoherent combination the spreading is larger than that for the coherent combination, but for the incoherent combination the spreading is less affected by turbulence than that for the coherent combination. It may be that, for the small free-space diffraction we have z(T) < z(R), i.e., the spreading is affected by turbulence within the Rayleigh range; for the large free-space diffraction we have z(T) > z(R), i.e., the spreading is less affected by the turbulence within the Rayleigh range.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade, while the other two agents are in the lower grade. Then by introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically obtaining the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of both the other two agents by using a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of the usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret in a probabilistic manner. The scheme can also be modified to implement the threshold-controlled teleportation.

Under the conditions that is a -pseudomonotone mapping and is a -strongly pseudomonotone mapping, we prove the convergence of the algorithm constructed by projection subgradient method. Our algorithm can be applied for instance to some mathematical programs with complementarity constraints.

To solve this problem, the streakline framework based on Lagrangian fluid dynamics had been proposed recently. However, this framework computed optical flow field using conventional optical flow method (Lucas Kanade method) which has poor anti-interference performance, and serious deviation would be brought to the computation of optical flow field. Moreover, our experimental results show that using the formulation of streak flow similarity in this framework can result in incorrect flow segmentation. Therefore, we combine this framework with a high accurate variational model, and modify the corresponding formulation of streak flow similarity after analyzing the streakline framework in detail. Finally, an improved method is proposed to solve flow segmentation in crowded scenes. Experiments are done to compare these two methods and results verify the validity and accuracy of our method.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL				Li, Xiaoqing; Ji, Xiaoling			Propagation characteristics of decentered annular beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							MOMENTS	This paper studies the propagation characteristics related to higher-order moments of decentered annular beams through non-Kolmogorov turbulence. The analytical expressions for the mean-squared beam width w, the skewness parameter A, and the kurtosis parameter K are derived. The analytical expression for the non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameter T' is also derived, and the differences between two non-Kolmogorov turbulence parameters T' and T are examined. It is shown that K depends on both T and T', but w and A only depend on T. K decreases monotonically as the spectral power law exponent a increases, but there exist a maximum of w and a minimum of A when alpha = 3.112. When propagation distance z is long enough, A reaches zero, i.e., the intensity distribution is perfectly symmetric about the centroid position axis. In free space, both A > 0 and A < 0 may appear on propagation. However, it is always A > 0 or A < 0 on propagation when turbulence is not weak. On the other hand, in turbulence, the maximum of K increases as the decentered parameter increases and the obscure ratio decreases. In particular, when z is long enough, the beam spot is elliptical in free space, but it becomes circular in turbulence.

By contrast, interaction of 4-methyl-3-(R)-2-(OH)-C6H4C=N(2'-(2''-(OR1)C6H4)C6H4) (R = adamantyl, R-1 = Me ((LH)-H-9); R = tBu, R-1 = Me ((LH)-H-10); R = C(Me)(2)Ph, R-1 = Me ((LH)-H-11)) with [VO(OnPr)(3)] led to the isolation of the dinuclear complexes [VO(mu-OH)(mu-OnPr)(L-n)](2) (n = 9, (11.4MeCN); 10, (12); 11, (13)), respectively. The molecular structures of 1 to 13 are reported. All complexes have been screened as pre-catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene in the presence of the co-catalyst diethylaluminium chloride (DEAC) with or without ethyltrichloroacetate (ETA) present at 1 or 10 bar of ethylene. Under high pressure, all pre-catalysts exhibited high activity and afforded high molecular weight (M-w approximate to 200 000 to 675 000 g mol(-1)), linear polyethylene with activities (in the presence of ETA) in the range 4960-16 400 g mmol(-1) h(-1); at one bar, the products were generally of lower molecular weight. The use of methylaluminoxane (MAO) or modified MAO (MMAO) as co-catalyst led to trace or poor (<= 110 g mmol(-1) h(-1)) activity, respectively.

This paper investigates the conditions under which the solution sets of fuzzy relational equations with sup-inf composition over complete Brouwerian lattices form lattices. We first give some properties of the decompositions of elements in complete lattices, then present a necessary and sufficient condition that the meet of a solution with any other solution is again a solution.

The review is organized in terms of the denticity of the chelate ligands employed, with particular reference to the influence of the ligand frameworks and their substituents on the catalytic performance for ethylene oligomerization/polymerization catalysis. The majority of the systems bear tri-dentate ligation at the iron/cobalt centre, though it is clear that bi-dentate iron/cobalt complex pre-catalysts have also attracted significant attention. Such systems produce in most cases highly linear products ranging from oligomeric alpha-olefins to high molecular weight polyethylene, and as such are promising candidates for both academic and industrial considerations.

Here we report an efficient strategy to enhance the recyclability of the heterogeneous catalysts by in situ entrapment of active nanoparticles in mesoporous carbon. A hard template method was used to fabricate the desired catalyst, where Al2O3 was employed as the template and polyphenols were used as carbon source as well as the stabilizing agent. Based on N-2 adsorption/desorption analysis, the catalysts adopt the high surface area of the Al2O3 template and feature mesoporous pores. Additionally, the noble metal nanoparticles (Pd) were found to be well entrapped inside the carbon matrix with good dispersion. The as-prepared catalysts were highly active in various heterogeneous hydrogenations of C=C containing substrates (quinoline, cinnamaldehyde, etc.) and exhibited excellent cycling stability without any significant loss of activity for 10 recycles, which is superior to that of the commercial Pd/C catalyst.

In this paper we prove that bipolar fuzzy sets and [0, 1](2)-sets (which have been deeply studied) are actually cryptomorphic mathematical notions. Since researches or modelings on real world problems often involve multi-agent, multi-attribute, multi-object, multi-index, multi-polar information, uncertainty, or/and limit process, we put forward (or highlight) the notion of m-polar fuzzy set (actually, [0, 1](m)-set which can be seen as a generalization of bipolar fuzzy set, where m is an arbitrary ordinal number) and illustrate how many concepts have been defined based on bipolar fuzzy sets and many results which are related to these concepts can be generalized to the case of m-polar fuzzy sets. We also give examples to show how to apply m-polar fuzzy sets in real world problems.

However, many of these needs have received little attention, and some of them may be less relevant now than they were 70 years ago. Two studies were conducted to investigate current motives. In Study 1, we used the Striving Assessment to elicit the personal strivings of 255 undergraduate university students. Murray's taxonomy was unable to account for 50% of the 2,937 strivings. These strivings were thematically groups into 11 new categories and combined with 7 Murrayan needs to form the Comprehensive Motivation Coding System (CMCS). In Study 2, Thematic Apperception Test (TAT) stories produced by 143 undergraduate student participants were coded by these two systems. Murray's system was unable to fully account for 42% of motives identified in the TAT stories, but the CMCS was able to account for 89%. These findings suggest that Murrayan needs may not adequately describe contemporary motivations and that the CMCS has the potential to do so. However, due to the limited demographics of our sample, further investigations are needed.

J	Ji, XL; Baykal, Y; Jia, XH				Ji, Xiaoling; Baykal, Yahya; Jia, Xinhong			Changes of the centroid position of laser beams propagating through an optical system in turbulent atmosphere	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Centroid position; Turbulent atmosphere; Laser beams with distortion	NON-KOLMOGOROV TURBULENCE; PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; WAVE	In this paper, the effects of atmospheric turbulence, initial field amplitude, optical system and thermal blooming on the centroid position of laser beams propagating through the atmosphere are studied in detail. With the average over the ensemble of the turbulent medium, the centroid position is independent of turbulence. However, the centroid position depends on the centroid positions at the source plane and in the far-field, and the elements of ray-transfer-matrix. The physical reason why the centroid position changes on propagation is that the far-field centroid position is not located on the propagation z-axis due to the field phase distortion and the decentred intensity. The centroid position of laser beams with the spherical aberration and the decentred intensity is examined analytically. When laser beams with the decentred intensity propagate through the atmosphere, the effect of thermal blooming on the centroid position is investigated by using the four-dimensional (4D) computer code of the time-dependent propagation of high power laser beams through the atmosphere.

Eight candidate structures of known transition-metal compounds are chosen to probe for rhenium diboride ReB2. The calculated lattice parameters are consistent with the experimental and theoretical values. Based on the third order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure P-t between the ReB2-ReB2 and MoB2-ReB2 phases is firstly determinate. Elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature are derived. The single-bonded B-B feather remains in ReB2 compounds. Furthermore, according to Mulliken overlap population analysis, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with partial metallic bond is presented. Both strong covalency and a zigzag topology of interconnected bonds underlie the ultraincompressibilities. In addition, the superior performance and large hardness (39.1 GPa) of ReB2-ReB2 indicate that it is a superhard material. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

The predicted new phase of CrB3 belongs to the rhombohedral phase with R-3m symmetry and it transforms into a hexagonal phase with P-6m2 symmetry at 64 GPa. The mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities of CrB3 are verified by the calculated elastic constants and formation enthalpies. Also, the full phonon dispersion calculations confirm the dynamic stability of predicted CrB3. Considering the role of metallic contributions, the calculated hardness values from our semiempirical method for rhombohedral and hexagonal phases are 23.8 GPa and 22.1 GPa, respectively. In addition, the large shear moduli, Young's moduli, low Poisson's ratios, and small B/G ratios indicate that they are potential hard materials. Relative enthalpy calculations with respect to possible constituents are also investigated to assess the prospects for phase formation and an attempt at high-pressure synthesis is suggested to obtain chromium triboride.

The trimers consist of three triphenylene discotic units linked to a central 1,2,4-trisubstituted benzene ring via flexible spacers. The trimers were synthesized in the yields up to 70% by mixing the monomers with 10 mol% of Co-2(CO)(8) as the catalyst in refluxing 1,4-dioxane. The liquid crystalline properties were investigated by using polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Trimer 4 with an ester connecting group and a longer spacer exhibited a rectangular columnar mesophase, while 5b and 5c possessing an ether linkage and a shorter spacer display a hexagonal columnar mesophase. The connecting functional group and the length of the flexible spacer between the central benzene ring and the triphenylene units have pivotal influence on the mesomorphism.

Although dimeric porphyrin ligands and platinum(II) complexes display nearly the same absorption spectra in the concentration range from 10(-7) to 10(-4) mol.dm(-3), these ligands and their complexes show concentration-dependent emission when the length of aliphatic chain is beyond four carbon atoms. At elevated concentration of the ligands and complexes, the emission spectra show obvious red-shifts. For complex Pt2C6(OPTPP)(2) and Pt2C10 (OPTPP)(2), the emission maxima at 652 nm are red-shifted to 676 and 681 nm at concentrations >10(-4) mol.dm(-3). Emission spectra of the sublimate films of complexes also display similar red-shifts: 43 nm for Pt2C6(OPTPP)(2) and 53 nm for Pt2C10(OPTPP)(2). The concentration-dependent emission indicates that there are intramolecular pi-pi interactions in porphyrin dimers and platinum(II) metalloporphyrins.

Different from all the previous related literature, the authors use the contraction mapping theory to obtain in this paper the existence of other solutions for PDEs with p-Laplace besides the trivial solution. In fact, if there is only the trivial solution for the PDEs, the stability criteria about the trivial solution would become meaningless. Moreover, infinitely many solutions for these PDEs of all the previous related literature can be obtained by employing the methods of this paper.

Methods: Cytotoxicity was characterized by 50 % inhibition (IC50) of human breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7) using 3-(4,5-dimethylthaizol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Apoptosis was analysed by Hoechst33258 staining and DNA ladder. MCF-7 cellular superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) vitality and malondialdehyde (MDA) content were evaluated. Results: The essential oil was cytotoxic to MCF-7 cell line. A dose- and time-dependent inhibition was observed with IC50 values of 18.75, 9.45 and 10.50 mu g/ml at 6, 24 and 48 h, respectively. Analyses by Hoechst33258 staining and DNA ladder indicate that the essential oil induced apoptosis. SOD vitality significantly decreased (p < 0.05) by 51 % when the concentration of the essential oil increased from 1.25 to 12.5 mu g/ml while CAT vitality significantly increased (p < 0.05) by 71 % when essential oil concentration was similarly increased. The MDA content of each treatment group, when compare to control, did not show any significant difference (p < 0.05). Conclusion: The essential oil of C. ambrosioides was cytotoxic to MCF-7 cell line and induced apoptosis.

Growth occurred with 0-5.0% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 10-42 degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C) in trypticase soya broth. Phylogenetic analyses based on the 16S rRNA and gyrB genes identified the isolate as a member of a novel species of the genus Pseudomonas. Strain SgZ-6(T) exhibited the highest 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity to 'Pseudomonas linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 (97.5 %), followed by Pseudomonas sagittaria JCM 18195(T) (97.4 %), P. oleovorans subsp. lubricantis DSM 21016(T) (96.6 %), P. tuomuerensis JCM 14085(T) (96.5 %) and P. alcaliphila JCM 10630(T) (96.4 %). Strain SgZ-6(T) showed the highest gyrB gene sequence similarity of 93.7% to 'P. linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 among all type strains of genus Pseudomonas. DNA DNA pairing studies showed that strain SgZ-6(T) displayed 47.1 and 40.3% relatedness to 'P. linyingensis' CGMCC 1.10701 and P. sagittaria JCM 18195(T), respectively. The major isoprenoid quinone was ubiquinone 9 (Q-9). The whole-cell fatty acids consisted mainly of summed feature 3 (C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c), C-16:0 and summed feature 8 (C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c). The DNA G C content of the genomic DNA was 68.1 mol%.

Growth occurred with 0-3.0 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 2.0 %), at pH 5.5-9.0 (optimum pH 7.0) and at 25-42 A degrees C (optimum 30-37 A degrees C) in liquid Reasoner's 2A medium. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene and gyrB gene sequences revealed that strain WM-3(T) was most closely related to the type strains of the species Pseudomonas linyingensis and Pseudomonas sagittaria. Its sequence similarities with P. linyingensis CGMCC 1.10701(T) and P. sagittaria JCM 18195(T) were 97.4 and 97.3 %, respectively, for 16S rRNA gene, and were 94.1 and 94.2 %, respectively, for gyrB gene. DNA-DNA hybridization between strain WM-3(T) and these two type strains showed relatedness of 35.6 and 30.9 %, respectively. G+C content of genomic DNA was 69.4 mol%. The whole-cell fatty acids mainly consisted of C-16:0 (30.0 %), C-16:1 omega 6c and/or C-16:1 omega 7c (19.3 %) and C-18:1 omega 6c and/or C-18:1 omega 7c (16.3 %). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain WM-3(T) belongs to genus Pseudomonas but represents a novel species, for which the name Pseudomonas oryzae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is WM-3(T) (=KCTC 32247(T) =CGMCC 1.12417(T)).

Growth was observed to occur at 35-60 A degrees C, at pH 7.0-10.0 and with 0.5-10 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum growth: 50 A degrees C, pH 8.0 and 0.5-3 % NaCl). Cells were determined to be catalase- and oxidase-positive. The predominant respiratory quinone was identified as MK-7; the major polar lipids were determined to be diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, glycolipid, aminoglycolipid and an unidentified phospholipid; the DNA G+C content was determined to be 46.6 mol%; and the major fatty acids (> 5 %) were identified as anteiso-C-15:0 (33.6 %), iso-C-15:0 (24.1 %) and anteiso-C-17:0 (13.4 %). The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons indicated that strain DX-5(T) should be assigned to the genus Bacillus, and was related most closely to the type strains of B. fortis DSM 16012(T) (96.3 %), B. composti KACC 16872(T) (96.3 %) and B. fordii DSM 16014(T) (95.8 %).

The ceramics sintered at 1000 degrees C for 2h possess a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and pseudocubic phases is formed at x = 0.025. The addition of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 retards the grain growth and induces two dielectric anomalies at high temperatures (T-1 similar to 450-550 degrees C and T-2 similar to 700 degrees C, respectively). After the addition of 2.5 mol% Bi0.5K0.5TiO3, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are improved and very high Curie temperature of 708 degrees C is obtained. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the microstructure and electrical properties of the ceramics. Critical sintering temperature is 970 degrees C. For the ceramic with x=0.025 sintered at/above 970 degrees C, large grains, good densification, high resistivity and enhanced electrical properties are obtained. The weak dependences of microstructure and electrical properties on dwell time are observed for the ceramic with x = 0.025. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Use of acetaldoxime as the hydrolysis reagent instead of H2O facilitates the operation of the reaction. The significantly decreased amount of nitriles, along with use of weak base K2CO3 instead of strong base KOH, makes this transformation atom-efficient and environmentally benign. A variety of N-arylamides and benzoxazole derivatives can be synthesized according to this approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

So, two B. fangiana populations were multiclonal and highly diverse. The largest single clone may occur over a distance of about 30 m. Our results demonstrated that the genotypic diversity and genet density of B. fangiana clonal population did not change significantly (47 versus 45) with genet aging and low partitioned genetic differentiation was between the two populations (Gst = 0.0571). The analysis of molecular variance consistently showed that a large proportion of the genetic variation (87.79%) existed among the individuals within populations, whereas only 12.21% were found among populations. In addition, the high level of genotypic diversity in the two populations implies that the further works were needed to investigate the reasons for the poor seed set in B. fangiana after flowering.

A novel low-energy hybrid process for the removal of organic contaminants in ultrapure water systems	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						carbon adsorption; TOC; photocatalytic oxidation; ultrapure water; nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide	DOPED-TITANIUM-DIOXIDE; CARBON SURFACE-CHEMISTRY; ACTIVATED CARBON; PHOTOCATALYTIC OXIDATION; DRINKING-WATER; ADSORPTION; PESTICIDES; POLLUTANTS; OZONE; UV	To achieve the goal of implementation of low-energy and low-chemical usage for trace organic compound removal, the hybrid oxidation/adsorption purification system using nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide catalytic oxidation followed by activated carbon adsorption was proposed in this paper. When isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, and urea were selected as model components, superior oxidation effects were achieved by combination of nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide with 254nm UV unit than by traditional high-energy-consumed 185nm UV unit, which indicated such configuration would be an ideal candidate to replace the current high-energy-consumed UV unit. By incorporating this new configuration into the semiconductor wastewater recycling system, the granule-activated carbon bed adsorption efficiency for total organic carbon was compared with the granule-activated carbon adsorption efficiency for total organic carbon in traditional purification system, where the 185nm UV lamp was used as oxidation unit. The experimental results showed that the hybrid low energy consumption catalytic oxidation/adsorption system had higher efficiency than the traditional high-energy-consumed oxidation/adsorption system for trace organic compound removal. This was because the radicals formed in the UV oxidation process reacted with the organic compounds adsorbed on the activated carbon and regenerated the adsorption sites. This self-cleaning mechanism effectively extended the lifetime of activated carbon bed and increased its adsorption capability. (c) 2013 Curtin University of Technology and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Nonuniformity behavior during regeneration of the diesel particulate filter	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						diesel particulate filter; nonuniformity; temperature excursion; wrong-way	WRONG-WAY BEHAVIOR; WALL-FLOW; THERMAL REGENERATION; SOOT COMBUSTION; CATALYTIC REGENERATION; TEMPERATURE; MODEL; PERFORMANCE; SIMULATION; OXIDATION	The incomplete regeneration of diesel particulate filter may cause a local build-up of the soot on the partially regenerated areas during next filtration cycle. This may be one of reasons causing the melting of the ceramic filter during regeneration. In this paper, we investigated several situations at which the particulate matter was partially regenerated. The simulations illustrated that at stationary feed conditions, the influence of nonuniformity of soot loading on the peak temperature rise was less important. When regeneration was conducted at transient feed conditions, the peak temperature attained under the condition of uneven soot distribution along the channel, especially more soot accumulated near the end of the diesel particulate filter, was much higher than that attained under the condition of even soot distribution inside the channel.

The isolate could grow in the presence of 0-3.0% NaCl (w/v), at temperatures of 30-60 degrees C and at pH 5.5-9.5, forming ivory-coloured colonies. When the 16S rRNA gene sequence of the isolate was compared with those of other bacteria, the highest similarity was observed with Kroppenstedtia eburnea DSM 45196(T) (96.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity). The G+C content of the genomic DNA was 56.3 mol%, the cell-wall peptidoglycan contained LL-diaminopimelic acid, the main polar lipids were diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylmethylethanolamine and phosphatidylglycerol, and the major menaquinone was MK-7. The major cellular fatty acids (>5 %) were iso-C-15:0, iso-C-16:0, iso-C-17:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. On the basis of its phenotypic and phylogenetic properties, chemotaxonomic analysis and the results of physiological and biochemical tests, strain GD02(T) (=CGMCC 1.12404(T)=KCTC 29149(T)) was designated the type strain of a novel species of the genus Kroppenstedtia, for which the name Kroppenstedtia guangzhouensis sp. nov. is proposed.

A fast and efficient coupling-matrix method is designed to calculate the Chern number in finite crystalline and disordered systems. To show its effectiveness, we apply the approach to the Haldane model and the lattice Hofstadter model, and obtain the correct quantized Chern numbers. The disorder-induced topological phase transition is well reproduced, when the disorder strength is increased beyond the critical value. We expect the method to be widely applicable to the study of topological quantum numbers.

The physical characteristics of Li4Mn5O12 were characterized by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The electrochemical capacitance performance of Li4Mn5O12 electrode was characterized by cyclic voltammetry, galvanostatic charge/discharge, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. These analyses indicated that Li4Mn5O12 was able to deliver 168 F g(-1) within the potential range of 0-1.4 V at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1) in 1 mol L-1 Li2SO4. Nine hundred cycles later, the capacitance faded to 165 F g(-1) with cutting down by 0.003 F g(-1) per cycling period and also can remain 98.2 % of original value, displaying a good cycling performance.

The present study examined whether deviant peer affiliation mediated the relationship between school connectedness and PIU, and whether this mediating process was moderated by adolescent self-control. A total of 2,758 Chinese adolescents (46 % male; mean age = 13.53 years, SD = 1.06) from 10 middle schools completed anonymous questionnaires regarding school connectedness, deviant peer affiliation, self-control, and PIU. After controlling for gender, age, socioeconomic status, and parental attachment, it was found that the negative association between school connectedness and adolescent PIU was partially mediated by deviant peer affiliation. Moreover, this indirect link was stronger for adolescents with low self-control than for those with high self-control. These findings underscore the importance of integrating the social control theory and organism-environment interaction model to understand how and when school connectedness impacts adolescent PIU.

When beta not equal 0 degrees, there is no obvious nucleation in the magnetization reversal process. The remanence decreases as beta decreases, and the squareness of the hysteresis loops is weakened, leading to the sharp decrease of energy product. For Nd2Fe14B(10 nm)/alpha-Fe(8 nm), the energy product decreases by 30.3% when beta = 10 degrees. In the magnetization reversal process, as the total energy reaches the maxium, Zeeman energy decreases with increasing of beta, and the exchange energy first increases and then decreases slightly, and the anisotropic energy increases with the increasing of beta. The deviation of easy axis has a greater influence on the energy product of the bilayer system with larger soft thickness. The out-of-plane deviation of easy axis has a similar effect.

Especially, some birds can use the geomagnetic field for navigation. According to the avian magnetoreception mechanisms, birds can build magnetic map for orientation and navigation by sensing the intensity and incline of geomagnetic field. However, researches on the magnetoreceptor of birds are still at the stage of discovery and identification, and it is necessary to study the iron-mineral-based structures to know whether they have the physical and magnetic properties to act as magnetoreceptor in living system. In this paper, the maghemite platelet chains in the iron-mineral-based magnetoreceptor have been studied with three-dimensional simulation based on the theories of micromagnetics. The reaction of the maghemite platelet chains with geomagnetic field has been investigated. Result indicates that the maghemite platelet chains with vortex domain can response to the change of the orientation of geomagnetic field.

Aiming at improving the frequency efficiency of the secondary network, we set a multiantenna relay station in the secondary network to perform two-way relaying. Three linear processing schemes at the relay station based on zero forcing, zero forcing-maximum ratio transmission, and minimum mean square error criteria are derived to guarantee the quality of service of primary users and to suppress the intrapair and interpair interference among secondary users (SUs). In addition, the transmit power of SUs is optimized to maximize the sum rate of SUs and to limit the interference brought to PUs. Numerical results show that the proposed multiuser two-way relay processing schemes and the optimal power control policies can efficiently limit the interference caused by the secondary network to primary users, and the sum rate of SUs can also be greatly improved.

In comparison to conventional bi-directional 1st-order DRA, the effective noise figure (ENF) is found to be lower by amount of 0 to 4dB due to the RFL-based 2nd-order pump, depending on the on-off gain, while the low-noise 1st-order Raman pump is used for compensating the worsened signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the vicinity towards the far end of the fiber and avoiding the potential nonlinear impact induced by excess injection of pump power and suppressing the pump-signal relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer. As a result, the gain distribution can be optimized along ultra-long fiber link, due to combination of the 2nd-order RFL and low-noise 1st-order pumping, making the transmission distance be extended significantly. We utilized such a configuration to achieve ultra-long-distance distributed sensing based on Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA). A repeater-less sensing distance record of up to 154.4km with 5m spatial resolution and similar to +/- 1.4 degrees C temperature uncertainty is successfully demonstrated.

To achieve the task, Bell state measurement and unitary operation are needed. It is shown that the quantum information initially distributed in five spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. The result shows a peculiar phenomenon that the RIC is not always performed perfectly. It can be achieved with certain probability.

In 2006, Chen et al. initiated the study of rough approximations on a complete completely distributive lattice (CCD lattice for short) and brought generalizations of rough sets into a unified framework. In this paper, we discuss the approximation operators on a CCD lattice. Based on the concept of neighborhood, three kinds of upper approximation operators and a kind of lower approximation operator are constructed. Basic properties of lower and upper approximation operators are examined. Furthermore, the relationships among these operators are analyzed. (C) 2013 Published by Elsevier Inc.

Four base pair adjacent base substitution mutations (CAAA to TTTT) and eight bp insertion mutations were found in orf366-c compared with orf364. ORF366-C was predicted to contain one membrane-spanning domain using TMHMM online software. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis showed that orf366-c was upregulated in the CMS-C line in comparison to its maintainer line at the uninucleate stage. The protokaryotic protein expression of orf366-c in Escherichia coli showed that ORF366-C could be a cytotoxic protein. All the results indicated that orf366-c may be associated with maize CMS-C.

The geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates and products have been optimized completely at B3LY P/6-31+G* level with the validation of the vibration analysis and the energy calculation. Atoms in molecules (AIM) theories and nature bond orbital (NBO) have been applied to discuss the orbits interaction and the bond natures. Catalytic mechanism is also interpreted by frontier orbital theory. Two possible reaction paths I-A and I-B were obtained. The results indicated that I-A is the really main possible path of the reaction. Meanwhile, the single point energy of the reaction process in gas and solvent at 6-311+G* level has been individually investigated with higher precision. The results indicate that the reaction mechanism and the change trend of correspondence energy at two different levels are consistent. The final result of the our theory study agrees with the experimental data, and it illustrate that CuI is an effective catalyst in this reaction.

The results show that when the middle layer is semiconductor layer, influenced by the Rashba spin-orbit coupling, the minimum transverse times difference between the spin-up and down electrons can appear if the relative angle values in two ferromagnetic layers are nearly the ii/2 and 3Tc/2, respectively. When the middle layer is insulator, the transverse time difference between the different spin orientations can be varied with the potential barrier heights and flip if the height exceeds a critical value.

Eighteen stable structures for the luteolin-guanine complexes have been found respectively. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Meanwhile, both the number and strength of hydrogen bond play important roles in determining the stability of the complexes which can form two or more hydrogen bonds. Theories of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital have also been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes which were corrected by basis set superposition error are 6.04-56.94 kJ/mol. The calculation results indicate that there are strong hydrogen bonding interactions in the luteolin-guanine complexes. We compared the interaction between luteolin and four bases of DNA, and found luteolin-thymine was the strongest and luteolin-adenine was the weakest. The interaction between luteolin and DNA bases are all stronger than luteolin-water.

The scheme takes on new process and framework in sign protocol, of which the TPM has only to perform three exponentiations, moreover, the signature which isn't knowledge of signature, is a signature of the ordinary ecliptic curve system itself. Compared to other schemes, the whole performance of the scheme is the best, and the scheme not only satisfies the same properties, but also is more simple and efficient. This paper gives not only a detailed security proof of the proposed scheme which shows that the scheme meets the security requirements of anonymity and unlinkability, but also a careful performance analysis by comparing with the existing DAA schemes.

This paper explores classification method suitable for the ALOS (Advanced Land Observing Satellite) in mountainous terrain. Mountainous terrain mapping using ALOS image faces numerous challenges. These include spectral confusion with other land cover features, topographic effects on spectral signatures (such as shadow). At first, topographic radiometric correction was carried out to remove the illumination effects of topography. In addition to spectral features, texture features were used to assist classification in this paper. And texture features extracted based on GLCM (Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix) were not only used for segmentation, but also used for building rules. The performance of the method was evaluated and compared with Maximum Likelihood Classification (MLC). Results showed that the object-oriented method integrating spectral and texture features has achieved overall accuracy of 85.73% with a kappa coefficient of 0.824, which is 13.48% and 0.145 respectively higher than that got by MLC method. It indicated that texture features can significantly improve overall accuracy, kappa coefficient, and the classification precision of existing spectrum confusion features. Object-oriented method Integrating spectral and texture features is suitable for land use extraction of ALOS image in mountainous terrain.

Differing from the conventional WDM-PON systems, the downstream and upstream data are physically encrypted by chaotic carriers, and the decryption processes are performed based on WDM chaos synchronization. We numerically demonstrate that with sufficient wavelength spacing, a high quality chaos synchronization between the chaotic carriers with identical wavelength can be maintained, which enables the proposed WDM-PON to afford multichannel chaotic communications at high bit rates in both the downstream and upstream directions; in addition, the security of the physical layer can be greatly enhanced. The proposed scheme shows a potential way for implementing physically-secure PONs.

The obtained ground state structure properties are found to be consistent with existing experimental and theoretical results. The pressure-induced variations of structure parameters (a, b, c and V) indicate that the solid nitromethane has an anisotropic compressibility, and the compression along the c direction is more difficult than along a and b directions. From the vibration curves of intermolecular bond length and bond angle, we find that the C-N bond is the most sensitive among these bonds under pressure, suggesting that the C-N bonds may be broken first under external loading. The influence of pressure on the electronic properties of solid NM has been studied, indicating that solid NM is an insulating compound with a large indirect band gap and tends to be a semiconductor with increasing pressure. Finally, we predict the elastic constants and their pressure dependence for the solid NM with the bulk modulus, Young's modulus, shear modulus and the Poisson's ratio derived.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure and La3+ diffuses into the Bi-0.5(Na0.84K0.16)(0.5)TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a rhombohedral symmetry. The addition of La leads to the significant change in the grain morphology and size for the (Bi1-xLax)(0.5)(Na0.84K0.16)(0.5)TiO3 and a number of rod grains with the length of 10-50 mu m and the diameter of 1-2 mu m are observed in the ceramic with x = 0.04 sintered at 1,140 A degrees C for 2 h. However, as sintering temperature increases to 1,160 A degrees C, the rod grains disappears and the uniform and rectangular grains are observed in the ceramics with x = 0.04. As x increases from 0 to 0.06, the coercive field E (c) of the ceramics decreases from 4.33 to 2.81 kV/mm and the remanent polarization P (r) of the ceramics retains the high values of 25.9-27.7 mu m/cm(2). The depolarization temperature T (d) decreases from 154 to 50 A degrees C with x increasing from 0 to 0.10. All the ceramics exhibit the diffusive phase transition at high temperature (280-320 A degrees C). The ceramic with x = 0.04 sintered at 1,150 A degrees C for 2 h exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d (33) = 165 pC/N and k (p) = 32.9 %. The optimum sintering temperature is 1,150 A degrees C at which the improved piezoelectric properties (d (33) = 165 pC/N and k (p) = 32.9 %) are obtained. At the high La3+ level (x = 0.10 and 0.12), the ceramics exhibit weak ferroelectricity (P (r) = 13.0-21.2 mu m/cm(2)) and thus possess poor piezoelectricity (d (33) = 17-27 pC/N).

The 3D calculations are numerically solved using the finite difference method, where the results are carefully compared with those calculated by one-dimensional (1D) model. It is found that the calculated hysteresis loops and energy products based on the two methods are consistent with each other. Both nucleation fields and coercivities decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-s increases. In addition, the calculated spatial distributions of magnetization orientations in the thickness direction at various applied fields based on both methods signify a three-step magnetic reversal process, which are nucleation, growth and displacement of the domain wall. The calculated magnetic orientations within the film plane, however, are totally different according to the two methods. The 3D calculation exhibits a process of vortex formation and annihilation. On the other hand, the 1D calculation gives a quasi-coherent one, where magnetization orientation is coherent in the film plane and varies in the thickness direction. This new reversal mechanism displayed in the film plane has a systematic influence on the nucleation fields, coercivity and energy products. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Yuan, X.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Two basic double-quantitative rough set models of precision and grade and their investigation using granular computing	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Variable precision rough set; Graded rough set; Double quantification; Model region	INFORMATION GRANULATION; INCLUSION DEGREE; BETA; RULES	The precision and grade of the approximate space are two fundamental quantitative indexes that measure the relative and absolute quantitative information, respectively. The double quantification of the precision and grade is a relatively new subject, and its effective implementation remains an open problem. This paper approaches the double quantification problem using basic rough set models. The Cartesian product is a natural operator for combining the two indexes given their completeness and complementary natures, and we construct two new models using this strategy. The fundamental items (i.e., the complete system, quantitative semantics and optimal computing) of the model regions are studied using granular computing. First, the model regions (MR granules) and basic model regions (BMR granules) are defined in the traditional fashion using logical double-quantitative semantics; basic semantics (BS) is provided for the double-semantic description, and the semantic extraction of the MR and BMR granules is realized within the BS framework. Computing granules (BMRC granules) are then proposed for the basic model regions to optimize the computation, and a two-dimensional plane and granular hierarchical structure are provided. Two basic algorithms for computing the MR and BMR granules are proposed and analyzed, and the BMRC-granules algorithm generally exhibits superior performance in terms of the temporal and spatial complexity. We also explore the properties of the approximation operators and the notions of attribute approximate dependence and reduction. Finally, we provide an example application from the medical field. The two models provide a basic double quantification of the precision and grade and have concrete double-quantitative semantics; they also represent a quantitatively complete expansion of the Pawlak model.

At the end of this paper, we establish the global existence of weak solutions to the Cauchy problem of the system under consideration. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this work, the characteristics (including gain, nonlinear impairment and noise figure) for forward and backward pumping of the ring-cavity based DRA scheme are fully investigated. Furthermore, as a typical application of the proposed configuration, ultra-long-distance distributed sensing with Brillouin optical time-domain analysis (BOTDA) over 142.2km fiber with 5m spatial resolution and +/- 1.5 degrees C temperature uncertainty is achieved, without any repeater. The key point for the significant performance improvement is the system could offer both of uniform gain distribution and considerably suppressed pump-probe relative intensity noise (RIN) transfer, by optimized design of system structure and parameters.

Let R be a one-dimensional Noetherian domain with quotient field K and integral closure T. Then it is proved that R is a G-Dedekind domain if and only if for any prime ideal P of R which contains (R : (K) T), P is Gorenstein projective. We also give not only an example to show that G-Dedekind domains are not necessarily Noetherian Warfield domains, but also a definition for a special kind of domain: a 2-DVR. As an application, we prove that a Noetherian domain R is a Warfield domain if and only if for any maximal ideal M of R, R-M is a 2-DVR.

Moreover, NMR spectra of curcumin analogues compounds were studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G(d,p) by GIAO method. The results show that the structure of four kinds of compounds, a larger conjugated system, has good planarity. Because of introducing hydroxyl and methoxy, the compound-B/C/D-C-3, C-4 and compoud-A and compound-D-C, have greater delta value. delta value of compound-A-C,. C-6 is relatively smaller, and value of C-3 is relatively larger. In the conjugated carbonyl compounds, compared with the acetaldehyde value (201 ppm), carbonyl C-13 delta value (183 ppm) decreases relatively, C-11, 15 (a-carbon) delta value(122 ppm) decreases relatively, and C-9,(17) (beta-carbon) value(145 ppm) increases relatively. Finally, the correlation between experimental & value and theoretical & value of the H-1 NMR was analyzed through the linear regression method. Results show that they have good correlation, and the experimental values coincide with the theoretical values.

The results show that the hole and electron transport rates of the six truxene derivative molecules are 0.018-0.062 and 0.055-0.070 cm(2).V-1.s(-1), respectively, and the truxene derivative molecule with 3, 8, 13-three octyloxy chains can be designed into dual polarity transport materials. In truxene derivative molecules with three alkoxy chains, introduction of three methoxyl or hydroxyl group could reduce hole and electron transport rate. The introduction of electron-donating groups or conjugated groups would reduce the energy gap of truxene derivative molecules, which meet the requirements for the organic semiconductor.

XRD patterns and HRTEM reveals that the as-synthesized MnO nanoparticles are of pure crystalline phase. TEM image shows that the MnO nanoparticles are in spherical shape with a narrow size distribution. Both oil phase and the nanoparticles protected with inert gas in the synthesis process can avoid the oxidization of Mn2+. The obvious exchange bias effect can be observed from the M-H loop of MnO nanoparticles under zero field cooling (ZFC) and FC measurements. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent AC susceptibility of the MnO nanoparticles reveals that the exchange bias effect originates from the antiferromagnetic MnO core and the spin-glass surface, rather than the superparamagnetic phase.

The performance of the Monte Carlo approach is compared with the performance of the modified maximum global discrimination index (MMGDI) method on simulations in which the only content constraint is on the number of items that measure each attribute. The results of the two simulation experiments show that (a) the Monte Carlo method fulfills all the test requirements and produces satisfactory measurement precision and item exposure results and (b) the Monte Carlo method outperforms the MMGDI method when the Monte Carlo method applies either the posterior-weighted Kullback-Leibler algorithm or the hybrid Kullback-Leibler information as the item selection index. Overall, the recovery rate of the knowledge states, the distribution of the item exposure, and the utilization rate of the item bank are improved when the Monte Carlo method is used.

Method The mothers and fathers of 729 children attending primary school in Chengdu, China participated in this study. Each parent completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, the Chinese Family Assessment Instrument, and the Children's Attitudes and Behaviours towards Animals questionnaire. Results Findings from an actor partner interdependence model demonstrated that parents' ratings of family functioning and of their child's externalizing coping style predicted only modest amounts of variance in animal cruelty. In particular, parents' ratings of their child's externalizing coping style most consistently predicted animal cruelty. Family functioning, fathers' ratings in particular, played a minor role, more so for boys compared with girls. Conclusion This study provided the first insight into childhood animal cruelty in China, and suggests that further research may enhance our understanding of these phenomena.

The study examined the archived logs from the group wild 'Discussion' and 'History' modules with a focus on the group members' scaffolded interaction when co-constructing texts in the wild space. The analysis revealed that the participants were actively engaged in reciprocal communication in terms of content discussion, social talk, task management, technical communication and language negotiation. They were also found to have scaffolded each other's writing efforts during co-constructing the product via multiple writing change functions, including addition, deletion, rephrasing, reordering and correction. This study explicated a distinct case of 'collective scaffolding' (Donato, 1994) in collaborative writing activities, where group members were simultaneously individual novices and collective experts as they pooled their knowledge and mutually guided each other through problem solving as to writing tasks. This study has important implications for instruction and future research on computer-mediated collaborative writing. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Firstly, under the framework of gravitation based co-evolution, individuals of the population are divided into two subpopulations according to their fitness values (objective function values), i.e., the elitist subpopulation and the common subpopulation, and then three types of gravitation-based update methods are implemented. With the cooperation of opposition-based operation, the proposed algorithm conducts the optimizing process collaboratively. Three benchmark algorithms and fifteen typical benchmark functions are utilized to evaluate the performance of GCOO, where the substantial experimental data shows that the proposed algorithm has better performance with regards to effectiveness and robustness in solving unconstrained optimization problems.

Present results show that these transition-metal nitrides are mechanically stable and the VN and CrN are ductile, whereas TiN is predicted to be brittle. Moreover, it is found that the high hardness of TiN, VN and CrN exhibits a remarkable decrease with transition-metal changed from Ti to Cr, and the metallic d d interactions play important roles on determining the hardness of transition-metal nitrides.

Topological phase transitions with and without energy gap closing	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article							QUANTIZED HALL CONDUCTANCE; SINGLE DIRAC CONE; INSULATOR; REALIZATION	Topological phase transitions in a three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator (TI) with an exchange field of strength g are studied by calculating spin Chern numbers C-+/-(k(z)) with momentum k(z) as a parameter. When vertical bar g vertical bar exceeds a critical value g(C), a transition of the 3D TI into a Weyl semimetal occurs, where two Weyl points appear as critical points separating k(z) regions with different first Chern numbers. For vertical bar g vertical bar < g(C), C-+/-(k(z)) undergo a transition from +/- 1 to 0 with increasing vertical bar k(z)vertical bar to a critical value k(z)(C). Correspondingly, surface states exist for vertical bar k(z)vertical bar < k(z)(C), and vanish for vertical bar k(z)vertical bar >= k(z)(C). The transition at vertical bar k(z)vertical bar = k(z)(C) is accompanied by closing of the bulk spin spectrum gap rather than the energy gap.	[Yang, Yunyou; Li, Huichao; Sheng, L.; Shen, R.; Xing, D.
