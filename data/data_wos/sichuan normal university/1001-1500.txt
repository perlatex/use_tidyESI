J	Wei, GW; Garg, H; Gao, H; Wei, C				Wei, Guiwu; Garg, Harish; Gao, Hui; Wei, Cun			Interval-Valued Pythagorean Fuzzy Maclaurin Symmetric Mean Operators in Multiple Attribute Decision Making	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Multiple attribute decision making (MADM); MSM operator; IVPFS; aggregation operators; potential evaluation; emerging technology commercialization	AGGREGATION OPERATORS; SIMILARITY MEASURES; ACCURACY FUNCTION; TODIM METHOD; SETS; MODELS; TOPSIS	Interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy (IVPF) set is one the successful extension of the existing theories for handling the uncertainties during the decision-making process. Under that environment, various aggregation operators have been developed by the authors to aggregate the different preferences of the decision makers under the different attributes. But these studies have conducted under the assumption that their corresponding pairs are independent and don't consider the interaction between the pairs of the membership degrees. In this paper, these conditions have been relaxed by considering the interrelationship between the different inputs by using Maclaurin symmetric mean (MSM) operator. Further, based on the input and MSM operator, we proposed two aggregation operators namely, IVPF Maclaurin symmetric mean and IVPF weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean operators and studied their desirable properties. A decision-making method based on these operators has been discussed for solving the decision-making problems under IVPF set environment. Finally, an illustrative example and a comparative analysis have been presented to demonstrate the proposed approach.

We present a micromagnetic study of isolated skyrmions and skyrmion clusters in ferromagnetic nanodisks driven by a spin-polarized current with spatially varied polarization. The current-driven skyrmion clusters can be either dynamically steady or static, depending on the spatially varied polarization profile. For the dynamically steady state, the skyrmion cluster moves in a circle in the nanodisk, whereas for the static state, the skyrmion cluster is stationary. The frequency of the skyrmion circular motion and the dependence of skyrmion cluster dynamics on the magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction are investigated. Our results may provide a pathway to realize devices based on magnetic skyrmion clusters.

The Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic sets (P2TLSs) are useful tools to depict uncertainty in MADM. This paper use TODIM method to solveMADMwith the Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic numbers (P2TLNs). Firstly, the definition, comparison and distance of P2TLNs are briefly presented, and classical TODIM for MADM are introduced. Then, the extended classical TODIM method is proposed to deal with MADM problems with P2TLNs, and its important characteristic is to fully consider the decision makers' bounded rationality which is a real action in MADM. Furthermore, we extend TODIM method to Pythagorean interval 2-tuple linguistic sets (PI2TLSs). Finally, a numerical example is proposed and a comparative analysis is also given.

However, the H-L test is sensitive to the sample sizes and the number of groups in H-L test. Cautions need to be taken for interpreting an H-L test with a large sample size. In this paper, we propose a simple test procedure to evaluate the model fit of logistic regression model with a large sample size, in which a bootstrap method is used and the test result is determined by the power of H-L test at the target sample size. Simulation studies show that the proposed method can effectively standardize the power of the H-L test under the pre-specified level of type I error. Application to the two datasets illustrates the usefulness of the proposed model.

When one component breaks down, it is repaired by the repair equipment. Further, the repair equipment may fail during the repair period and then be replaced by a new one. The replacement time of the repair equipment is a generally distributed random variable. Employing the semi-Markov process theory and the Laplace (Laplace-Stieltjes) transform, the mean time to the first failure, the steady-state system availability, the rate of occurrence of failures of the system, the probability that the repair equipment is being replaced and the rate of occurrence of failures of the repair equipment are derived. Meanwhile, some numerical illustrations are reported to demonstrate how the various parameters of the model influence the behaviour of the system. Finally, a special case (n - 1)-out-of-n:G repairable system is discussed to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.

A self-consistent charge density functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) method was used. We find that the N-NO2 bond dissociation is the primary pathway for RDX with the NO2 groups facing (group 1) the shock, whereas the C-N bond scission is the dominant primary channel for RDX with the NO2 groups facing away from (group 2) the shock. In addition, our results present that the NO2 groups facing away from the shock are rather inert to shock Loading. Moreover, the reaction pathways of a single RDX molecule under the 11 km s(-1) shock velocity have been mapped out in detail, NO2, NO, N2O, CO and N-2 were the main products.

In this study, an efficient cobalt-based three-dimensional heterogeneous catalyst was fabricated through in situ growth of ZIF-67 on nickel foam (NF/ZIF-67). The factors influencing NF/ZIF-67-activated peroxymonosulfate (PMS) were investigated. Enhanced RhB degradation was observed using NF/ZIF-67-activated PMS under neutral conditions and high temperatures. Sulfate radicals were the dominant active species for the oxidative decolorization of RhB with NF/ZIF-67-activated PMS. NF/ZIF-67 was easily separated from the solution, and it also retained high catalytic stability. This study provides a rapid and mild method for the fabrication of promising three-dimensional heterogeneous catalysts for PMS activation and wastewater treatment.

The efficiency of humic acid removal by modified aged refuse (MAR) under different preparation conditions (calcination temperature, dose of aged refuse for calcination and holding time) was systematically investigated. Results showed that the optimum preparation conditions are calcination temperature = 700 degrees C, AR dose for calcination = 25 g, and holding time = 2.0 h. The characteristics of the modified aged refuse obtained under different calcination conditions were determined by Fourier transform infrared, X-ray diffraction and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. In addition, the effects of modified aged refuse dose and initial solution pH on adsorption performance were studied. The removal of humic acid increased with higher doses of modified aged refuse, and weak alkaline (initial pH = 8.0) conditions were favorable for humic acid removal. A pseudo-second order model fitted the experimental data well. Moreover, the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Langmuir isotherm model, in which the monolayer surface loading was calculated to be approximately 37 mg g (-1). During the adsorption process, the molecular weight, degree of condensation and aromaticity of humic acid were considerably decreased, according to 3D-EEM analysis. MAR as a new type of adsorbent thus provides a potential adsorption method for humic acid.

The subject of this study is how to assess the performance of health, safety, and environment (HSE) in Chinese college laboratories. The assessment system is established by three parts. First of all, HSE performance assessment indicators for laboratories in Chinese colleges are identified based on the previous studies. Then set valued iteration is used to calculate the weights of the various indicators. Following that, multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) method with Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic operators is used to assess the laboratory HSE performance in colleges. Finally, taking a college in Sichuan Province as an example, the proposed method is used to assess the laboratory HSE performance. The assessment result shows that the proposed method used in this study is practical and feasible.

In this study, the optimum activation conditions were studied using the absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) and color number removal efficiencies and by comparison of the different processes. The inner oxidation mechanism was investigated by ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectrophotometry and three-dimensional (3D) excitation-emission matrix (EEM) tests. The results show that oxidation effects followed the order MW/PDS > MW/H2O2 > heat/PDS. The efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal, UV254, and color number were 45.50%, 48.95%, and 88.35%, respectively. The biodegradability was enhanced to 0.23 under optimum conditions (initial pH of 3, MW irradiation power of 450 W, PDS dosage of 3.5 g L-1, and reaction time of 10 min). The UV-vis spectra suggest that the humification degree and aromaticity of organics in the concentrated leachate greatly declined in the MW/PDS process. 3D EEM spectra indicate that the molecular weight of organic substances in the concentrated leachate decreased markedly and that the constitution of the organics became simpler after the MW/PDS process. In a word, the MW/PDS process is a promising method for concentrated leachate treatment.

In this study, a novel magnesium-carbon nanotube composite was prepared by a ball milling process in argon atmosphere using polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) as a binder. The resulting material was then tested for the in situ generation of H2O2. The preparation and operation conditions of the composite were systemically investigated and analyzed to improve the efficiency of the in situ generation of H2O2. Under the optimized conditions, while aerating with oxygen for 60 min, a maximum H2O2 concentration of 194.73 mg L-1 was achieved by the Mg-CNTs composite prepared using Mg:CNT:PVDF with a weight ratio of 5:1:2.4. In the Mg-CNTs/O-2 system, dissolved oxygen molecules were reduced to H2O2, while magnesium was oxidized owing to the electrochemical corrosion. In addition, a part of dissolved magnesium ions converted into magnesium hydroxide and precipitated as nanoflakes on the surfaces of CNTs. A mechanism was proposed, suggesting that the formation of a magnesium/carbon nanotubes corrosion cell on the Mg-CNT composite promoted the in situ synthesis of H2O2. Overall, this study provides a promising and environmentally friendly strategy to fabricate magnesium/CNT composites for the in situ generation of H2O2, which could be applied in energy conversion and advanced oxidation processes for refractory wastewater treatment.

The studied model plays a significant role in population ecology. A linearized Crank-Nicolson method for such problem is proposed by combing the Crank-Nicolson approximation in time with the fractional centred difference formula in space. Using the discrete energy method, the suggested scheme is proved to be uniquely solvable, stable and convergent with second-order accuracy in both space and time for sufficiently small space and time increments. Several numerical experiments for solving the delay fractional Hutchinson equation and two real problems in population dynamics are provided to verify our theoretical results.

The high reliability, strong processing capacity, large storage space of cloud computing makes the resource-constrained clients remotely operate the heavy computation task with the help of cloud server. In this paper, a new algorithm for secure outsourcing of high degree polynomials is proposed. We introduce a camouflage technique, which the real polynomial will be disguised to the untrusted cloud server. In addition, the input and output will not be revealed in the computation process and the clients can easily verify the returned result. The application of the secure outsourcing algorithm in keyword search system is also studied. A verification technique for keyword search is generated based on the outsourcing algorithm. The client can easily verify whether the server faithfully implement the search work in the whole ciphertext space. If the server does not implement the search work and returns the client "null" to indicate there is no files with the query keyword, the client can easily verify whether there are some related files in the ciphertext database.

In this work, we shall present some novel Dice similarity measures of picture fuzzy sets and the generalized Dice similarity measures of picture fuzzy sets and indicate that the Dice similarity measures and asymmetric measures (projection measures) are the special cases of the generalized Dice similarity measures in some parameter values. Then, we propose the generalized Dice similarity measures-based patterns recognition models with picture fuzzy information. Then, we apply the generalized Dice similarity measures between picture fuzzy sets to building material recognition. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the similarity measures for building material recognition.

X-ray diffraction and Rietveld refinement revealed that the impurity phase was effectively inhibited after the addition of more amount of Na2CO3. All samples, including the pristine LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 sample and that prepared with different extra amounts of Na2CO3, exhibited uniform polyhedron morphology and their average grain sizes increased with the amount of Na2CO3. After adding 5% more Na2CO3, the average grain size of the sample was larger than 500 nm. When compared to other samples, the amount of impurity phase was minimum in the sample prepared with 5% more Na2CO3. Due to the impurity suppression, the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 sample prepared with 5% more Na2CO3 exhibited superior electrochemical performance for Li-ion batteries, showing initial discharge capacities of 125.4 mA h g(-1) and 126.1 mA h g(-1), and high capacity retentions of 90.7% and 87.6% after 200 cycles at 0.1 C and 0.5 C, respectively. It also exhibited the lowest intrinsic resistance and best Li+ diffusion kinetics among all the samples deduced from electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. (C) 2018 The Electrochemical Society.

Fourteen factors contributing to ideal teaching behaviours were identified through exploratory factor analyses. Nine factors, including idea explanation and speedy lecture, were rooted in traditional Chinese culture; five factors, including concrete representation and student activities, were influenced by Western cultures. Three teacher profiles were identified through k-means clustering analysis. The perspectives of in-service teachers were dominated by a painless meaning-emphasised profile; these teachers emphasised meaningful learning for students and avoided the fast pace and demanding requirements that can cause distress in students, whereas pre-service teachers were dominated by an all-round profile, revealing their openness to all factors. Compared with pre-service teachers, in-service teachers' perspectives were more similar to those of students.

It is demonstrated that when a plane light wave is scattered from a particulate medium, the beam condition, i.e., the condition under which the scattered field could retain its beam-like form, is governed by both the property of each particle and the property of the distribution characteristic. As an example, the scattered field of a collection of Gaussian-distributed particles is discussed, and some special cases are investigated to illustrate the beam condition. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH.

In this paper, we report on the validation of the Chinese HEIghten (R) Critical Thinking assessment with a nationally representative sample of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science students from 35 institutions in China. Key findings suggest that there was a test delivery mode effect favoring the paper tests over the online tests. In general, the psychometric quality of the items was satisfactory for low-stakes, group-level uses but there were a few items with low discrimination that awaits further investigation. The relationships between test scores and various external variables such as college entrance examination scores, university elite status and student perceptions of the test were as expected. We conclude with speculations on the key findings and discussion of directions for future research.

However, most existing approaches focus on monitoring shifts in location parameters and may not be able to detect a scale change that is also likely to occur in surgical data. In this article, we derive a weighted score test statistic to construct an exponentially weighted moving average chart and propose a new charting method to simultaneously monitor location and scale parameters. This new chart may be applied to monitoring surgical performance. Simulation results indicate that the proposed method is more efficient than existing methods, such as the risk-adjusted cumulative sum chart, in detecting the heterogeneity of surgical outcomes. A data set from the Surgical Outcome Monitoring and Improvement Program in Hong Kong is used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed chart.

By studying the effects of 4 factors and carrying out orthogonal tests and scale-up experiments, optimal treatment conditions (temperature 90 degrees C, reaction time 75 min, PS dosage 20.0 g L-1 and initial pH approximate to 2.0) were obtained. The results showed that under these conditions, COD and color removal efficiencies were 99.22% and 99.99%, respectively. Moreover, an increase in BOD5/COD ratio (from 0 to 0.31) indicates significantly improved biodegradability. Dinitrodiazophenol dosage was measured by high performance liquid chromatography, which showed that dinitrodiazophenol removal efficiency reached 99.99%. Furthermore, the degradation process was analyzed by ultraviolet-visible spectra and Fourier transform infrared spectra. The former demonstrated that aromatic compounds in the system were destroyed during mineralization and the latter indicated that nitro groups on the benzene ring could be oxidized to nitrate. After verification test of the free radicals, mechanism of heat-activated persulfate system was assumed to be that SO4- and OH function together and SO4- predominate. To conclude, the heat-activated PS oxidation technology performs effectively in treatment of DDNP wastewater and expands applications of sulfate-radical-based advanced oxidation technology in industrial-wastewater treatment.

Here, we report on the structural and transport properties of large-scale few-layer MoS 2 back-gated field effect transistors (FETs), fabricated using conventional pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique. Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy results confirmed that the obtained MoS 2 layers on SiO2/Si substrate are multilayers. The FETs devices exhibit a relative high on/off ratio of 5 x 10(2) andmobility of 0.124 cm(2)V(-1)S(-1). Our results suggest that the PLD would be a suitable pathway to grow 2D layers for future industrial device applications.

At the same time, the laws and regulations about the environmental protection in the world are constantly introduced, the academic research about the environmental issues is also increasing, more and more consumers show concern for the green products, and the restrictions of the "green trade barrier'' in the international to the export products in China enterprises must pay attention to the influence of their behavior on the environment in pursuit of economic efficiency. In this context, the green supply chain management (GSCM) emerges. GSCM theoryfirst appeared in some foreign countries, and started later in China. Compared with some developed countries, the GSCM theory in China is still not mature. From the source speaking, there is lack of a complete GSCM system. In this paper, we combine the generalized weighted Bonferroni mean (GWBM) operator, generalized weighted geometric Bonferroni mean (GWGBM) operator, dual GWBM operator, and dual GWGBM operator with Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic numbers to propose the generalized Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic WBM (GP2TLWBM) operator, generalized Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic WGBM (GP2TLWGBM) operator, dual GP2TLWBM (DGP2TLWBM) operator, and dual GP2TLWGBM(DGP2TLWGBM) operator, and then, the multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) methods are developed based on DGP2TLWBMand DGP2TLWGBMoperators. Finally, we use an example for green supplier selection to prove the MADM process of the proposed algorithms.

Enhanced mechanical entanglement in an optomechanical cavity with a Coulomb interaction	OPTIK			English	Article						Two-coupled-mechanical-mode optomechanical cavity; Mechanical entanglement; Coulomb interaction	ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; MOVABLE MIRRORS; SLOW LIGHT; QUANTUM; CRITERION	A scheme of a two-mode optomechanical cavity is proposed to investigate the entanglement between two nanomechanical resonators which are coupled by a Coulomb interaction. It is found that the mechanical entanglement can be improved by the Coulomb coupling, and the restriction of environment temperature on the entanglement can be relaxed by strengthening the Coulomb coupling. Additionally, the optomechanically induced transparency in the present scheme can provide a wider transparency frequency range in which the mechanical entanglement is created. The scheme of the enhanced entanglement by the Coulomb interaction is of more convenient controllability only by adjusting the bias gate voltage. (C) 2018 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The liquid crystalline behaviour, polarised emission, photophysical and phase-state-dependent luminescence properties for all platinum (II) complexes were investigated systematically. Cyclometalated platinum (II) complexes b(n) show smectic phase structure; however, a(n) and c(n) show nematic phase. The platinum (II) complexes exhibit different photoluminescence (PL) behaviour in solution, crystal phase, liquid crystal phase and amorphous thin films. Moreover, these metallomesogens show strongly polarised photouminescence in liquid crystalline phases. Especially, the PL dichroic ratio is up to 24.6 in nenatic phase. [Graphics] .

By constrast, use of the amino calixarene' [Mo(NCMe)(2-C6H4CH2CH2C6H4NH2-2)L] afforded the potassium/ethoxide-free complex [Mo(NCMe)(2-C6H4CH2CH2C6H4N-2-CHC6H2-2-(OH)-3,5-tBu)L] (2.2MeCN). Reaction of the amino calixarene' (two equivalents) with the dialdehyde [1,3-(CHO)(2)-5-MeC6H3OH-2] led, following work-up, to the isolation of the cation-anion pair [C46H42N4O2](2+)[Mo6O19]2-C2H3N (3.MeCN). The molecular structures of 12MeCN, 2 2MeCN and 3 MeCN are reported, for which it was necessary to use synchrotron radiation for data collection. Complex 1 contains an eliptical calixarene conformation as a result of -interactions between the K+ and the arene groups and a distorted O5N octahedral geometry at the molybdenum centre, whereas in K+/ethoxide-free' 2, the calixarene retains the cone conformation and the metal possesses a distorted octahedral O4N2 coordination environment. In 3, a protonated macrocyclic cation, formed via hydrolysis, has weak intermolecular interactions with the polyoxomolybdate anion. [GRAPHICS] .

Moreover, NMR Spectra of the coumarin derivatives compounds have been studied at the level of B3LYP/6-311G (d, p) by GI-AO method. The results showed that the structure of the six compounds, a larger conjugated system, had good planarity. Different Substituents and different positions of substituents all have different influences on NMR of the several coumarin derivatives. In general, after the hydrogen atom on the benzene ring is substituted by other groups, the delta value of the alpha-C atom next to the substituent changes obviously, the delta value of the Ortho carbon atoms have great change too, but the delta value of the meta carbon atom have almost no change. The effect of electronegativity of substituents on alpha-C atoms presents obvious regularity, while the influence of conjugate effect on carbon atoms of benzene ring is more complex. Finally, in order to show the correlation between theoretical calculation and experimental values, we showed the correlation diagram of the chemical shift values of the six kinds of derivatives, and carried on the linear regression. Results showed that the correlation between the chemical shift theory and the experimental value of the six kinds of the Coumarin derivatives was very good.

To explore the relationship between PTSD and depression further, a cross-sectional study design was adopted. Three years after the Ya'an earthquake, 4137 adolescents (mean age 15.12) who had personally experienced the earthquake were assessed. The study results showed that PTSD significantly predicted future depression, with the effect being partially mediated by the negative life events after the earthquake. Gender was not found to be a significant moderator between PTSD and depression.

It serves as the electron donor for most cytochromes in P450s, which are involved in the metabolism of foreign compounds and the synthesis of endocrine hormones and have tremendous biotechnological potential for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals. However, commercially available CPR is very expensive, and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli is a more affordable way to obtain enough CPR. In the present study, a full-length cDNA encoding a CPR was isolated from the liver of the Chinese white rabbit using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The cDNA contains a 2,040-bp open reading frame, which is predicted to encode an enzyme of 679 amino acids. The deduced peptide shares 99.5% amino acid similarity with CPR of Oryctolagus cuniculus, showing that the Chinese white rabbit is a close genetic relative of the European rabbit. The cloned CPR has the typical hallmarks, including an N-terminal membrane anchor and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-, flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-binding domains. An N-terminally truncated protein was heterologously expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells and purified, and the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme was determined. The enzyme activity analysis indicated that electrons were passed from NADPH to Cyt C at a rate of 2.3174 mu mol/(min/mg protein). The present study provides an efficient procedure for preparing large amounts of recombinant CPR, which would facilitate the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and fine chemicals with P450s.

The Zn-CNTs was characterized by SEM, BET and XRD, and the degradation of 4-chloro-3-methyl phenol (CMP) in aqueous solution was investigated using Zn-CNT5/O-3 system. The experimental results showed that the rate constant of total organic carbon (TOC) removal was 0.29 min-I, much higher than that of only O-3 system (0.059 min(-1)) because Zn-CNTs/O-2 system could generate H2O2 in. situ, the concentration of H2O2 could reach 156.14 mg/L within 60 min at pH 6.0. The high mineralization ratio of CMP by Zn-CNTs/O-3 occurred at wide pH range (3.0-9.0). The increase of Zn-CNTs dosage or gas flow rate contributed to the enhancement of CMP mineralization. The intermediates of CMP degradation were identified and the possible degradation pathway was tentatively proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In general, in weak oceanic turbulence, the aperture averaged scintillation can be effectively suppressed by means of the coma aberration, and the aperture averaged scintillation decreases as the coma aberration coefficient increases. However, in moderate and strong oceanic turbulence the influence of coma aberration on aperture averaged scintillations can be ignored. In addition, the aperture averaged scintillation dominated by salinity -induced turbulence is larger than that dominated by temperature -induced turbulence. In particular, it is shown that for coma-aberrated Gaussian beams, the behavior of aperture averaged scintillation index is quite different from the behavior of point scintillation index, and the aperture averaged scintillation index is more suitable for characterizing scintillations in practice.

The sideband absorption peaks and the transparency dips, located symmetrically around the resonant point, characterize the respective effects of the photonic and phononic interactions on the transparency spectra: the sideband absorption peaks move outward with increase of the photonic interaction due to the normal-mode splitting, and the distance between the two sideband transparency dips is determined by the phononic interaction strength. Meanwhile, the study reveals the competition and the harmonization between the photonic and phononic interactions. When simultaneously switching on the photonic and phononic paths, it is shown from the absorption spectra that the features of the interacting path with stronger strength dominate over the other one with weaker strength. Additionally, the transparency around the resonant point manifests the destructive interference between the photonic and phononic coupling paths when the strength of two paths are comparable. These findings display the flexible tunability of the transparency, and can be used to distinguish between the two quantum paths in the absorption spectrum.

DAST consists of an organic pyridinium salt (cation), one of the most efficient non-linear optical active chromophores and a sulfonate (anion) for enhancing the stability of the noncentrosymmetric macroscopic crystal. Such an organic crystalline salt DAST exhibits highly electro-optical and nonlinear optical coefficients, and it is an efficient emitter of THz pulses. The steady ground-state structure of DAST is obtained by a step-by-step optimization method with gradually increasing the convergence accuracy. The calculated terahertz spectra in 0-4 THz are in good agreement with experimental measurements, implying the reasonability of DFT-D2 method. Moreover, the vibration displacement vector diagrams for DAST molecular structure are obtained using Cambridge sequential total energy package animation simulation function. The results indicate that the phonon modes of DAST crystal at 1.12 THz are attributed to the optical phonon modes of the anion and cation, and DAST cation (organic pyridinium salt) and anion (sulfonate) undergo translational vibrations in their respective (benzene ring) plane. In contrast the vibrations at 1.46 THz and 1.54 THz are mainly related to the vibration of the sulfonate, among which 1.46 THz vibration is caused by the rotation of the sulfonate along the a axis, while 1.54 THz is due to the motion of the whole sulfonate along the c axis. And the vibrations at 2.63 THz and 3.16 THz originate from the torsional vibrations of cations and the rotation of anions, respectively. The results presented in this work clearly illustrate the contributions of the anion and cation of DAST in the THz responses. The mode assignments provide important reference and guidance for further synthesis of new DAST derivatives with larger electro-optical coefficients. In particular, our results suggest that DFT method is a powerful theoretical tool for studying the THz photonics and it is helpful not only for better understanding the mechanisms of the THz responses of organic electro-optic crystals, but also for controlling their performances.

A new VLAD-based control chart for detecting surgical outcomes	STATISTICS IN MEDICINE			English	Article						risk-adjusted; exponentially weighted moving average; VLAD; surgical outcomes	WEIGHTED MOVING AVERAGE; QUALITY-CONTROL; CUSUM	The timely detection of surgical quality changes is becoming increasingly important. Variable life-adjusted display (VLAD) has a wide range of applications in the medical field. However, the control limits of VLAD are not defined; thus, the charts alone cannot reveal whether surgical quality underwent a significant change. This paper proposes a new risk-adjusted exponentially weighted moving average VLAD (RAEV) chart and provides a control limit that can be used with the VLAD. The RAEV chart is designed to detect shifts in the odds ratios of patients' surgical risk. Simulation is used to demonstrate that the proposed RAEV chart efficiently detects shifts of various magnitudes, and an example is provided to illustrate the implementation of the RAEV control limits in a VLAD chart.

Methods: The total flavonoids of Elsholtzia densa Bent were extracted utilizing the ultrasonic extraction method, and purified by D101 macroporous adsorption resin. An in vitro antioxidant test, 3-(4,5dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay and iCELLigence system were used to evaluate their antioxidant, antibacterial and anti-tumor activities. Results: The results showed that the total flavonoids exhibited good scavenging ability in hydroxyl radical (center dot OH), DPPH free radical (DPPH center dot), and super oxide anion radical (O-2(-)center dot). Antioxidant activity was higher than for control (ascorbic acid). Their antibacterial activity was good with minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 2, 4 and 14 mu g/mL against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus subtilis, respectively. Anti-proliferation data from the iCELLigence system studies showed that the total flavonoids significantly inhibited the growth of five types of cells, including a normal human hepatocytes cell line (L02), two human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (SMMC-7721 and HepG-2), a human cervical cancer cell line (Hela) and a Baby Hamster Syrian Kidney cell line (BHK-21) (p < 0.05). AO/EB staining indicate that the total flavonoids might cause apoptosis of Hela cells. Conclusion: The results suggest that the total flavonoids from Elsholtzia densa Bent are potential natural antioxidants and antimicrobial agent, with anti-cancer properties.

The adsorbent was characterized by the X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Brunauer-Emmett-Teller.The fluoride adsorption behavior of Fe/gamma-Al2O3 was studied with the help of different process parameters vs. contact time, initial fluoride concentration, initial pH and other co-ions effect. Maximum magnitude of fluoride was adsorbed from aqueous solution at initial pH 5.5. Coexistence of SO42-, NO3- and Cl- did not affect fluoride adsorption, and high concentrations of HCO3- or PO43- only led to partial inhibition of fluoride adsorption. Adsorption kinetic study revealed that the adsorption process followed pseudo-second-order model. Adsorption data were fitted to Langmuir isotherm model, and the adsorption capacity was found to be 1.65 mg g(-1). A high desorption efficiency of 96.7% was achieved by treating fluoride loaded Fe/gamma-Al2O3 with 0.50 M NaOH solution. In addition, the adsorption mechanism analysis revealed that the pH variation during the adsorption of fluoride was mainly resulted from that the hydroxyl groups on the surface of the Fe/gamma-Al2O3 with amphoteric behavior in solution reacted with fluoride anions.

The aim of this investigation is to give an introduction to the dynamics and structure of lactic acid aqueous solution. The density, diffusion coefficients, hydrogen bonding lifetime and hydrogen bonding number have been calculated to clarify dynamical properties. The interaction between water and lactic acid was promoted, which lead to the hydrogen bondings in water decrease. At higher lactic acid mole fractions, the hydrogen bonding has significant contribution toward the microheterogeneity of the systems. The radial distribution functions, permittivity, coordination number, potential of mean force and tetrahedral order parameter have been demonstrated. The lactic acid strongly destroyed the tetrahedral structures of water, and the clear hydration shells are not formed around carbon atoms. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier B.V.

This study investigates how tourists' awe emotion is induced when tourists visit sacred mountains and how the awe experience influences their satisfaction. A survey is administrated at a famous sacred mountain in ChinaMount Emei. Results reveal that the awe experience is more elicited by the perceived vastness of natural environment for secular tourists, while is more encouraged by the perceived sanctity of religious ambience for pilgrim tourists. Awe experience is a mediator between the sense of perceptual vastness/sanctity and tourists' satisfaction. The mediation relationships through awe experience are moderated by the visitor types (pilgrims and secular tourists). Findings suggest that destination marketers should apply tourism strategies to encourage tourists' sense of awe.

Using the law of total probability decomposition, the renewal theory and the probability generating function technique, the transient and the steady-state probabilities that the server is busy at any epoch n (+) are derived. The authors also obtain the explicit expression of the probability generating function for the expected number of departures occurring in the time interval (0(+), n (+)] from any initial state. Meanwhile, the relationship among departure process, server's state process and service renewal process in server busy period is found, which shows the special structure of departure process. Especially, some corresponding results of departure process for special discrete-time queues are directly gained by our results. Furthermore, the approximate expansion for calculating the expected number of departures is presented. In addition, some other important performance measures, including the expected length of server busy period, server's actual vacation period and busy cycle period etc., are analyzed. Finally, some numerical results are provided to determine the optimum value N* for minimizing the system cost under a given cost structure.

It is shown that the orientation of a particle plays an important role for the spectral density and for the spectral degree of coherence of the scattered field. Numerical result shows that, when the ellipsoidal particle features rotational symmetry, the profile of the far zone distribution is governed by the polar angle of a particle's orientation, while the orientation of the far zone distribution is governed by the azimuthal angle of a particle's orientation.

Monodisperse droplets generated from microfluidics are encapsulated into crosslinked polymeric networks via an interfacial crosslinking reaction in microchannel to in situ produce the droplet-containing, fiber-like matrices. By stretching and twining the dried fiber-like matrices, the encapsulated droplets can be flexibly engineered into versatile shapes for template synthesis of controllable nonspherical microparticles and helices.

J	Yang, XM; Wu, W; Liu, K; Chen, WL; Zhang, P; Zhou, ZL				Yang, Xiaomin; Wu, Wei; Liu, Kai; Chen, Weilong; Zhang, Ping; Zhou, Zhili			Multi-sensor image super-resolution with fuzzy cluster by using multi-scale and multi-view sparse coding for infrared image	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Multi-sensor; Super-resolution; Sparse coding; Infrared image; Dictionary learning; Multiview representation; Fuzzy clustering theory	INTERPOLATION; SEGMENTATION; DICTIONARY; ALGORITHM; MOTION	Super-resolution (SR) methods are effective for generating a high-resolution image from a single low-resolution image. However, four problems are observed in existing SR methods. (1) They cannot reconstruct many details from a low-resolution infrared image because infrared images always lack detailed information. (2) They cannot extract the desired information from images because they do not consider that images naturally come at different scales in many cases. (3) They fail to reveal different physical structures of low-resolution patch because they extract features from a single view. (4) They fail to extract all the different patterns because they use only one dictionary to represent all patterns. To overcome these problems, we propose a novel SR method for infrared images. First, we combine the information of high-resolution visible light images and low-resolution infrared images to improve the resolution of infrared images. Second, we use multiscale patches instead of fixed-size patches to represent infrared images more accurately. Third, we use different feature vectors rather than a single feature to represent infrared images. Finally, we divide training patches into several clusters, and multiple dictionaries are learned for each cluster to provide each patch with a more accurate dictionary. In the proposed method, clustering information for low-resolution patches is learnt by using fuzzy clustering theory. Experiments validate that the proposed method yields better results in terms of quantization and visual perception than the state-of-the-art algorithms.

A number of studies have discussed multivariate nonparametric control charts. However, the proposed multivariate nonparametric control charts usually have strict requirements. In this paper, we construct a control chart for multivariate processes that is based on the Mahalanobis depth. Specifically, we use the concept of the Mahalanobis depth to reduce each multivariate measurement to a univariate index. It is worth mentioning that this approach is completely nonparametric. We also discuss the optimal strategy for the parameters. This chart is an adaptive chart and has a variable sampling interval. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed chart is efficient in detecting various magnitudes of shifts. A gravel data and a wine quality detection example are given to introduce the proposed control chart. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief lacks measurement invariance across three countries	PSYCHIATRY RESEARCH			English	Article						Schizotypy; Schizotypal; Cross-cultural; Invariance; Factor structure; Psychometric properties	CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; PSYCHOTIC EXPERIENCES; 3-FACTOR STRUCTURE; POPULATION; VALIDATION; SPQ; AGE; ADOLESCENTS; DISORDER; VERSION	The Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire-Brief (SPQ-B) is a commonly-used tool for measuring schizotypal personality traits and due to its wide application, its cross-cultural validity is of interest. Previous studies suggest that the SPQ-B either has a three- or four-factor structure, but the majority of studies have been conducted in Western contexts and little is known about the psychometric properties of the scale in other populations. In this study factorial invariance testing across three cultural contexts Australia, China and Chile was conducted. In total, 729 young adults (Mean age = 23.99 years, SD = 9.87 years) participated. Invariance testing did not support the four-factor model across three countries. Confirmatory Factor Analyses revealed that neither the four- nor three-factor model had strong fit in any of the settings. However, in comparison with other competing -models, the four-factor model showed the best for the Australian sample, while the three-factor model was the most reasonable for both Chinese and Chilean samples. The reliability of the SPQ-B scores, estimated with Omega, ranged from 0.86 to 0.91. These findings suggest that the SPQ-B factors are not consistent across different cultural groups. We suggest that these differences could be attributed to potential confounding cultural and translation issues.

The microstructure and electro-chemical characteristics of the materials were investigated by tuning the amount of KOH. When the weight ratio of KOH to pig nails is 1:1, the obtained nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon (NHPC-1) exhibits the largest specific surface area (2569 m(2) g(-1)) with interconnected porous network structure, which are beneficial to ion/electron storage and transfer. In addition, abundant nitrogen of 2.8 at% in the NHPC-1 also contributes to the high electrochemical activity of the super-capacitor during the charging/discharging process. As a result, the NHPC-1 electrode in the supercapacitor exhibits a high specific capacitance of 231 Fg(-1) at 1 Ag-1 and superior retention of 98% after 5000 cycles at 1 Ag-1 in 6 M KOH electrolyte. Additionally, the assembled symmetric device based on NHPC-1 exhibits a high energy density of 7 Wh kg(-1) at a power density of 500 W kg(-1). Our study suggests that waste pig nails can act as low-cost and renewable carbon precursors for high performance supercapacitor.

J	Yao, YY; Zhang, XY				Yao, Yiyu; Zhang, Xianyong			Class-specific attribute reducts in rough set theory	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Classification-based attribute reduct; Class-specific attribute reduct; Rough set; Three-way classification; Three-way decision; Feature selection	MODEL	The concept of attribute reducts plays a fundamental role in rough set analysis. There are at least two possibilities to define an attribute reduct. A classification-based or global attribute reduct is a minimal subset of condition attributes that preserves the positive region of the decision classification, namely, the positive regions of all decision classes, in a decision table. A class-specific, class-dependent, or local attribute reduct is a minimal subset of condition attributes that preserves the positive region of a particular decision class. While a classification-based reduct may not work equally well for every decision class, a class specific attribute reduct is optimally tailored to a particular decision class. However, studies in rough set theory are dominated by classification-based reducts; there is very limited investigation on class-specific reducts. An objective of this paper is to draw attention to class-specific reducts. We systematically compare the two types of reducts and investigate their relationships with respect to both individual reducts and families of all reducts. It is possible to derive a class-specific reduct from a classification-based reduct and to derive a classification-based reduct from a family of class-specific reducts. The families of all class specific reducts provide a pair of lower and upper bounds of the family of all classification based reducts. Based on a three-way classification of attributes into the pair-wise disjoint sets of core, marginal, and nonuseful attributes, we examine relationships between the corresponding classes of classification-based and class-specific attributes. The union of the sets of class-specific core attributes is the set of classification-based core attributes. It is only possible to obtain an upper bound for the set of classification-based marginal attributes and a lower bound for the set of classification-based nonuseful attributes from the family of the class-specific corresponding sets of attributes.

In this Article, we propose that formation of a thin amorphous Ni carbonate layer on Ni3N nanoarray supported on carbon cloth (Ni3N NA/CC) is an effective strategy to boost its OER activity in at near-neutral pH. When used as a 3D non noble-metal OER electrocatalyst, the resulting core-shell Ni3N@Ni-Ci NA/CC displays superior catalytic activity with extremely small overpotential of 400 mV for 20 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KHCO3 (bulk pH: 8.3). Moreover, it also exhibits considerable long-term electrochemical durability with its activity being preserved for at least 12 h. Conductive Ni3N nanoarray not only provides as the Ni source for in-situ electrochemical derivation of 3D Ni-Ci catalyst with high surface area, more exposed active sites and facilitated mass diffusion, but effectively prompts the electron transport from Ni-Ci shell to CC, enabling more efficient water oxidation electrocatalysis.

In this work, K0.5Na0.5NbO3+x mol CuSb2O6 lead-free piezoelectric ceramics were fabricated by a solid-state reaction method and the defect-driven evolution of piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties was studied. The addition of CuSb2O6 induces the formation of dimeric (Cu-Nb(''') - V-O(center dot center dot))' ( DC1) and trimeric dV(O)(center dot center dot) - Cu-Nb(''') - V-O(center dot center dot))(center dot) (DC2) defect dipoles. At low doping concentration of CuSb2O6 (0.5-1.0 mol%), DC1 and DC2 coexist in the ceramics and harden the ceramics, inducing a constricted double P-E loop and high Q(m) of 895 at x= 0.01. However, DC2 becomes more dominant in the ceramics with high concentration of CuSb2O6 (>= 1.5 mol%) and thus leads to softening behavior of piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity as compared to the ceramic with x= 0.01, giving a single slanted P-E loop and relatively low Q(m) of 206 at x= 0.025. All ceramics exhibit relatively high d(33) of 106-126 pC/N. Our study shows that the piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity of K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramics can be tailored by controlling defect structure of the materials.

The addition of a small amount of KCuTa3O9 (x <= 0.04) induces the formation of (Cu'''(Nb) - V-O(..))' (DC1) and (V-O(..) - Cu'''(Nb) - V-O(..) )(.) (DC2) defect dipoles; however, DC2 becomes dominant in the ceramics with high levels of KCuTa3O9. The DC1 can provide a restoring force to reverse the switched polarization, inducing double hysteresis loops, while DC2 slightly impedes polarization back-switching. Because of the combination of DC1 and DC2 associates, the ceramics become gradually "hardened" with x increasing from 0 to 0.01, giving a superhigh mechanical quality factor Q(m) of 2494 at x = 0.01, and then are gradually softened with x further increasing to 0.07, exhibiting a relatively low Qm of 549 at x = 0.07. Our study shows that the control of defect structures can effectively tailor the ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity of K0.5Na0.5NbO3-based lead-free ceramics.

The correlation of AMRs in Lactobacillus plantarum from fermented foods and human gut was examined. The AMRs varied with Lactobacillus species. For L. plantarum, the distributions of minimum inhibitory concentration to 12 antimicrobials were correlated between food and gut source (P < 0.05), and the percentages of resistant strains from foods and gut were also similar (P > 0.05) except to norfloxacin, where the AMR was more severe in gut than in foods (P < 0.05), while all 14 high-level vancomycin-resistant strains were from gut. Illustrated by L plantarum, the severity of resistance to most antimicrobials in lactobacilli from fermented foods and human gut gradually converged, with gut ones taking the leading role. Accordingly, AMR in human gut lactobacilli was more likely the consequence of clinical medication instead of acquired from fermented foods. Lactobacillus strains widely utilized in fermented foods would unlikely aggravate their AMR in human guts. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We report theoretical investigations of the Moire pattern formed by graphene (Gr) on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). For both the two-dimensional (2D) flat-sheet and the freestanding three-dimensional (3D) wavelike film geometries, the behaviors of Dirac electrons are strongly modulated by the local high-symmetry stacking configurations of the Moire pattern. In the 2D flat sheet, the secondary Dirac cone (SDC) dispersion emerges due to the stacking-selected localization of SDC wave functions, while the original Dirac cone (ODC) gap is suppressed due to an overall effect of ODC wave functions. In the freestanding 3D wavelike Moire structure, we predict that a specific local stacking in the Moire superlattice is promoted at the expense of other local stackings, leading to an electronic structure more similar to that of the perfectly matching flat Gr/hBN than that of the flat-sheet 2D Moire pattern. To capture the overall picture of the Moire superlattice, supercells containing 12 322 atoms are simulated by first principles.

In this communication, we describe the development of a Co-carbonate-hydroxide nanowire array on nickel foam (CoCH/NF) via in situ electrochemical conversion of the Co(CO3)(0.5)(OH)center dot 0.11H(2)O nanowire array. When utilized as a 3D catalyst electrode for the OER in 1.0 M KHCO3 (pH: 8.3), as-formed CoCH/NF demands overpotential of only 332 mV to drive a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2), with its catalytic activity being maintained for at least 130 h. Impressively, it also demonstrates a high turnover frequency value of 0.22 mol O-2 s(-1) at an overpotential of 500 mV.

Na2GdCO3F3 exhibits an intricate three-dimensional structure that is composed of NaO4F2, NaO2F4 and GdO3F6 distorted polyhedra and planar [CO3] triangles. Powder second-harmonic generation (SHG) using the Kurtz-Perry technique shows that Na2GdCO3F3 is type I phase-matchable, and the measured SHG coefficient was 2.0 times that of KH2PO4(KDP). The result from the UVevis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy study of the powder samples indicated that the short-wavelength absorption edge was below 200 nm, suggesting that Na2GdCO3F3 is a promising deep-UV nonlinear optical material.

It is significant and urgent to search for low-cost non-noble metal electrocatalysts for highly efficient and stable HER. Herein, for the first time, we present a facile and cost-effective hydrothermal and selenization strategy to synthesize NiSe2 nanoparticles embedded in carbon nanowires (NiSe2/C NWs). As a HER electrocatalyst, the NiSe2/C NWs hybrid delivers outstanding catalytic performance with a very low Tafel slope of 38.7 mVdec(-1), a small onset potential of similar to-144 mV (vs RHE), and a high cathode current density of 33 mA cm(-2) at -250 mV (vs RHE). Moreover, it also exhibits excellent long-term stability of NiSe2/C NWs even after 2000 voltammetric sweeps. The superior HER performance of NiSe2/C NWs is attributed to its unique structure constructed by ultrafine NiSe2 nanoparticles homogenously embedded in highly conductive carbon nanowires, which can not only provide abundant HER active sites, but also enhance the conductivity between the nanoparticles. It suggests that NiSe2/C NWs hybrid is a promising candidate to replace noble metal electrocatalysts for HER. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Silicon carbide (SiC) owns abundant ID geometrical structures, but little is known about their electronic transport properties. Hence, we conduct the systematic study of the electronic transport behavior of (SiC)(n) (n = 1-4) molecular linear chain, based on the density functional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. Results reveal that the conductance of SiC chain is highly sensitive to the local atomic rearrangement, and n is also an important factor to affect their transport properties: the longer the SiC chain, the higher localization of the frontier molecular orbitals and the deeper suppression in transmission spectrum which gives the lower equilibrium conductance and the current. Current-voltage curve of SiC Chains exhibit nonlinearity, implying their semiconductor characteristics. The rectifying ratios increase with n which reflect their asymmetric built-in structures and unequal coupling to Au surfaces. Additionally, by analyzing their projected densities of states, we find that p(x) and p(y) orbitals from Si and C atoms make a major contribution to electronic transport channel. Our theoretical studies are expected to provide more fundamental and comprehensive information for further research of the SiC linear chains.

Simulation results indicate that this novel structure can generate a photonic nanojet outside its volume when the refractive index contrast relative to the background medium is higher than 2: 1 in the condition of plane wave incidence. When the refractive index is smaller than 2, we show that an ultralong nanojet generated by the two-layer hemisphere has an extension of 28.2 wavelengths, and compared with the homogeneous dielectric hemisphere, it has superior performance in jet length and focal distance. Its dependence on the configuration and refractive index is investigated numerically.

According to our calculations of these trigonal crystals (space group of P3M1, No: 164), we found that all of them are fulfilled by the mechanical stability criteria under 31 GPa (for NiTe2), 37 GPa (for PdTe2) and 73 GPa (for PtTe2). The study on their structures revealed the elastic anisotropy of these isostructural compounds. Electronic structure calculations show that MTe2 are semi-metal. On the basis of the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also researches their thermodynamic properties. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on this, we propose two schemes for controlled dense coding by using the three-qubit entangled W state as the quantum channel in this paper. In these schemes, the controller (Charlie) can adjust the local measurement angle oee integral to modulate the entanglement, and consequently the average amount of information transmitted from the sender (Alice) to the receiver (Bob). Although the results for the average amounts of information are the same from the different two schemes, the second scheme has advantage over the first scheme.

Reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were optimized with the B3LYP method using the 6-311 + G(d,p) basis set (Ag using the pseudo potential basis set of LanL2DZ). Transition states and intermediates were confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinates (IRC). Consistent with literature reports, the key point of the transformation from 4-NBT absorbed on the surface of Ag-5 clusters to 4,4'-DMAB is the elimination of two O atoms on the amino group. Meanwhile, the catalytic coupling reaction of 4-nitrobenzenethiol on a silver cluster is easy to carry out under irradiation. The possibility of "inter system channeling" (ISC) between different potential energy surfaces in the coupling reaction of 4-NBT is further discussed. The irradiation has an auxiliary catalytic effect on the coupling reaction. Our research results can explain the observed experimental phenomena.

In this work, lanthanide luminescent materials of YF3:0.125Eu(3+), 0.5%Bi3+ with a variety of well-defined morphologies including spherical, truncated octahedron, octahedron and pseudo-sphere particle have been controllably synthesized via a facile hydrothermal method. Phase structure and morphology of the materials are tuned, and thus fluorescent properties are tailored by changing the synthetic parameters of reaction temperature and dwelling time. With increasing reaction temperature, the materials are transformed from KY3F10 to YF3, and the morphology varies from spherical to octahedron and finally truncated octahedra. When dwelling time increases, the samples also extend from KY3F10 to YF3 and the morphology changes from spherical to octahedron, then truncated octahedra and finally pseudo-sphere particle. The possible growth mechanism for diverse morphologies has been proposed. The fluorescence intensity of the materials is closely related to their morphologic characteristics. The YF3:0.125Eu(3+), 0.5%Bi3+ with truncated octahedra synthesized at 200 degrees C for 18 h presents the strongest emission intensity because of its less defects sites and large grain size. In addition, it has been demonstrated that the present luminescent materials can be potentially used as the luminescent ink. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on weather station data, this study first calculated ET (o) by using the FAO56 Penman-Monteith model. Then, the dryness index K (ratio of ET (o) to precipitation) was used to study the spatio-temporal variation of the wet-dry condition in China from 1961 to 2015; moreover, dominant climatic factors of the wet-dry condition change were discussed. The annual precipitation and ET (o) of the Qinling-Huaihe line were close to a balance (K approximate to 1.0). The annual precipitation in most areas exceeded the ET (o) in the south of this line and the east of Hengduan Mountains (K<1.0), where the climate is wet. Furthermore, the precipitation in the northwest inland areas of China, where the climate is dry, was markedly lower than ET (o) (K >= 4.0). The overall annual K of China fluctuated around the 55-year mean and its linear trend was not significant. However, a relatively wet period of about 10 yr (1987-1996) was recorded. The overall annual K of China showed strong cyclicality on the time scale of 3, 7-8, 11 and 26-28 yr, and regional differences of the annual K trends and cyclicality were large. The degrees of wetness in the Northwest China and western Qinghai-Tibet Plateau were substantially increased, whereas the degrees of dryness in the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, Sichuan Basin, and Loess Plateau were markedly increased. The linear trend of the annual K in most regions of China was not significant, and the annual K of most areas in China showed strong cyclicality on the 8-14 yr time scale. Precipitation was the dominant factor of wet-dry condition change in most areas, especially in North China, where the annual K change was highly correlated with precipitation.

J	Li, Y; Zhang, HJ; Dong, YC				Li, Yao; Zhang, Hengjie; Dong, Yucheng			The interactive consensus reaching process with the minimum and uncertain cost in group decision making	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Group decision making; Consensus reaching process; Uncertain cost	LINGUISTIC PREFERENCE RELATIONS; FUZZY GROUP DECISION; SUPPORT-SYSTEM; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; SOCIAL NETWORK; MODEL; FRAMEWORK; CONTEXT	The consensus model with the minimum cost (or minimum adjustments or minimum information loss) is a powerful decision tool for consensus building in the group decision making (GDM). In the extant consensus models with the minimum cost, the unit adjustment cost of each expert is assumed to be exactly known, and an optimization-based consensus model is utilized to support the consensus building. In the practical GDM, however, it is difficult to obtain the exact unit adjustment costs, and the unit adjustment costs of experts are often uncertain. Moreover, we argue that the consensus cannot be achieved directly using the established optimization-based consensus model, because the consensus building is an interactive process that needs the participation of experts. This paper proposes an interactive consensus reaching process with the minimum and uncertain cost. In the consensus reaching process, an optimization-based consensus model with the uncertain unit cost is constructed to obtain the optimal adjusted opinions of experts. Then, the costs/resources are provided for experts to modify their opinions, and the obtained optimal adjusted opinions are used as a reference for the opinions-modifying in the consensus reaching process. Meanwhile, the unit adjustment costs of experts can be estimated according to the actual situation of the opinions-modifying in the consensus reaching process. The detailed numerical and simulation analysis are conducted to demonstrate the validity of the proposed consensus reaching model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The effects of ammonia-N stress on the immune response of darkbarbel catfish Pelteobagrus vachellii were investigated in this study. Changes in overall histology, and in the expression of complement C3 and immunoglobulin M (IgM) in spleen and head kidney, and lysozyme and C3 in serum, were measured in 1 and 5 mg/L ammonia-N. Hyperemia, melano-macrophage assembly and loose splenosis were evident in spleen tissue. Both lysozyme and component C3 were significantly reduced in serum (P < 0.05) under both stress treatments, although lysozyme was increased slightly at 24 h in the 1 mg/L treatment. C3 mRNA expression increased at 6 h in spleen and 6-12 h in head kidney then decreased rapidly (P < 0.05), although C3 mRNA recovered to control levels in spleen at 96 h after the 1 mg/L treatment (P > 0.05). IgM expression also increased significantly at 6-12 h in spleen and 6-24 h in head kidney after the 1 mg/L treatment (P < 0.05). A similar overall pattern were observed with 5 mg/L ammonia (P < 0.05); IgM mRNA expression was elevated at 6 h in spleen and 6-12 h in head kidney (P < 0.05) then decreased to levels below controls (P < 0.05).

The addition of Sn4+ ions has no distinct influence on the crystal structure of the materials. After doped with an appropriate amount of Sn4+, the electrochemical performance of Li1.2Mn0.54-x Ni0.13Co0.13Sn (x) O-2 cathode materials is significantly enhanced. The optimal electrochemical performance is obtained at x = 0.01. The Li1.2Mn0.53Ni0.13Co0.13Sn0.01O2 electrode delivers a high initial discharge capacity of 268.9 mAh g(-1) with an initial coulombic efficiency of 76.5% and a reversible capacity of 199.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C with capacity retention of 75.2% after 100 cycles. In addition, the Li1.2Mn0.53Ni0.13Co0.13Sn0.01O2 electrode exhibits the superior rate capability with discharge capacities of 239.8, 198.6, 164.4, 133.4, and 88.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively, which are much higher than those of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 (196.2, 153.5, 117.5, 92.7, and 43.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2, and 5 C, respectively). The substitution of Sn4+ for Mn4+ enlarges the Li+ diffusion channels due to its larger ionic radius compared to Mn4+ and enhances the structural stability of Li-rich oxides, leading to the improved electrochemical performance in the Sn-doped Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode materials.

About 60-fold equivalents of Cd2+ in CdSe QDs can be exchanged simply by injected one equivalent Ag+ solution in CdSe QDs immobilized filter at room temperature, while this cation exchange reaction did not occur when only silver nanoparticles were injected. Based on this striking difference, the ultrasensitive and simple speciation analysis of Ag+ and AgNPs without using any pretreatment, chromatographic separation and centrifugation separation was accomplished via the determination of the released Cd2+ using HG-AFS. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limit (LOD) of Ag+ was 0.0001 ng mL(-1). The relative standard deviation (RSD) for 0.01 mu g L-1 Ag+ was better than 2.5% (n = 7). The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by analyzing one certified reference sample, four antibacterial textiles and drugs samples with satisfactory analytical results. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including ultrahigh-sensitivity, extremely simplicity and minimized interfere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Using the high pressure solid-state ion-exchange reaction route, we have successfully synthesized polycrystalline delta-NbN at 5.5 GPa and 1673 K. The refined lattice parameter of as-synthesized sample is 4.3960(6) angstrom, corresponding to the stoichiometric niobium nitride. The determined bulk modulus of delta-NbN is B-0 = 319(2) GPa with B-0' = 4.4(2), which is one of the most incompressible cubic transition metal mononitrides. Theoretical calculations of the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio agree well with experimental and previous theoretical results. The calculated minimum shear strength of delta-NbN is 23.4 GPa for the (111) [(1) over bar(1) over bar2] slip system, comparable to those of ZrN and HfN. In addition, a finite density of states at the Fermi level was revealed for delta-NbN, hence exhibiting metallic behavior.

Firstly, an integrated framework including several elements such as emergency organization, task, decision-agents, environment and their relations is developed from a systematic perspective. Then, this problem is formulated as a novel multi-objective 0-1 integer programming model to minimize total weighted completion times, total carbon emissions and total emergency costs. Next, branch and bound approach and handling strategies for multiple objectives are designed to solve this model. Finally, a case study from the Wenchuan earthquake is presented to illustrate the proposed model and solution strategies. Computational results demonstrate their significant potential advantages on allocating emergency organization from the perspectives of best practice, objective functions, preferences of decision-agents, and problem size.

Their morphologies, structures and optical and electronic properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), transmission electron microscope (TEM), Brunauer-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface areas, X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectra (FT-IR), X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis diffuse reflection spectra (UV-vis DRS), photocurrent technique and electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS). The typical triphenylmethane dye (malachite green) was chosen as a target organic contaminants to estimate the photocatalytic activities and photo-stabilities of Ag3PO4-BiPO4-PPy heterostructures under visible light irradiation. The results indicated that the existence of BiPO4 and PPy not only showed great influences on the photocatalytic activity, but also significantly enhanced photo-stability of Ag3PO4 in repeated and long-term applications. The degradation conversion of Ag3PO4-BiPO4-PPy heterostructures (ABP-3) was 1.58 times of that of pure Ag3PO4. The photo-corrosion phenomenon of Ag3PO4 was effectively avoided. The photocatalytic activity of up to 87% in the Ag3PO4-BiPO4-PPy heterostructures (ABP-3) can be remained after five repeated cycles, while only about 33% of the degradation efficiency can be reserved in pure Ag3PO4. The possible mechanism of enhanced photo-stability and photocatalytic activity of Ag3PO4-BiPO4-PPy heterostructures was also discussed in this work. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Herein, we demonstrate a strategy for fabricating three-dimensional (3D) Cu-encased N-doped carbon nanotube arrays which are directly grown on Cu foam (Cu@NC NT/CF) as a new efficient HER electrocatalyst. Cu nanoparticles are encased here instead of common transition metals (Fe, Co, or Ni) for pursuing a well-controllable morphology and an excellent activity by taking advantage of its more stable nature at high temperature and in acidic or alkaline electrolyte. It is discovered that metallic Cu exhibits strong electronic modulation on N-doped carbon to boost its electrocatalytic activity for HER. Such a nanostructure not only offers plenty of accessible highly active sites but also provides a 3D conductive open network for fast electron/mass transfer and facilitates gas escape for prompt mass exchange. As a result, the Cu@NC NT/CF electrode exhibits superior HER performance and durability, outperforming most of the reported M@NC materials. Furthermore, the etching experiments together with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis reveal that the electronic modulation from encased Cu significantly enhances the HER activity of N-doped carbon. These findings open up opportunities for exploring other Cu-based nanomaterials as efficient electrocatalysts and understanding their catalytic processes.

It is discovered that the self-templated conversion of NiMoO4 into MoNi4 nanocrystals and MoO3-x as dual active components dramatically boosts the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance. Benefiting from high intrinsic activity, high electrochemical surface area, 3D open network, and improved electron transport, the resulting MoNi4/MoO3-x electrode exhibits a remarkable HER activity with extremely low overpotentials of 17 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and 114 mV at 500 mA cm(-2), as well as a superior durability in alkaline medium. The water-alkali electrolyzer using MoNi4/MoO3-x as cathode achieves stable overall water splitting with a small cell voltage of 1.6 V at 30 mA cm(-2). These findings may inspire the exploration of cost-effective and efficient electrodes by in situ integrating multiple highly active components on 3D platform with open conductive network for practical hydrogen production.

However, the reported carbon hybrids always require a tedious fabrication process, including multistep chemical vapor deposition and a thermally stable catalyst. Therefore, it is highly desirable to exploit a simple, renewable, and scalable strategy to fabricate 3D heteroatom-doped carbon hybrids. Herein, a N, P-co-doped 3D carbon hybrid was successfully fabricated via a one-pot pyrolysis process. Due to the rapid Li+/e(-) transport among the 3D interconnected porous frameworks and effectively suppressed polysulfide dissolution by physical confinement and chemical interaction, the assembled Li-S batteries exhibit excellent electrochemical performance. The as-obtained cell delivers an ultrahigh initial discharge capacity of 1446 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C as well as an excellent rate capability of 921 mA h g(-1) at 1C. Additionally, a reversible and stable discharge capacity of 795 mA h g(-1) is maintained after 400 cycles at 1C, corresponding to an extremely low capacity decay of 0.034% per cycle. Such a design strategy is eco-friendly and generally applicable to combine the sp(2) nanocarbon with sp(3) amorphous carbon, which is crucial to construct 3D interconnected hierarchical porous carbons for advanced energy storage for applications in various fields, such as lithium batteries, catalysis and hydrogen storage.

The contrative analysis from X ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), infrared absorption spectrometer(FTIR) and energy dispersive spectrometer(EDS) show that higher purity and more uniform K2FeO4 crystals can be obtained by second recrystallized purification from crude products. Several experiments were performed to investigate the removal properties of K2FeO4 on Cu(II) and Cd(II) ions in the phenol-aqueous solution, including dosage of K2FeO4, shock time, solution pH, shock temperature, initial concentration and mixed ions. The K2FeO4 can remove Cu(II), Cd(II) and degrade phenol from phenol-aqueous solution in a single step of treatment. In addition, the removal mechanisms of metal ions including of adsorption, co-precipitate and surface complexation were revealed by scanning electron microscope (SEM), energy dispersive spectrometer (EDS), fourier transform infrared absorption spectrum (FTIR) in detail.

The microstructures of the prepared microcrystals were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and N-2 adsorption. Moreover, a mechanism for the morphology evolution of 3D flower-like MnCO3 microcrystals was also discussed in detail. Using the obtained 3D flower-like MnCO3 microcrystals as anode for lithium ion batteries and a series of tests including charge-discharge test, cycling ability, rate performances, cyclic voltammetry (CV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) were carried out. The results show that 3D flower-like MnCO3 microcrystals can be obtained by varying the reaction time and the dosage of Na(3)Cit at the hydrothermal temperature of 180 degrees C, and the suitable hydrothermal reaction time and the dosage of Na(3)Cit for the 3D flower-like MnCO3 microcrystals are 12 h and 3 mmol, respectively. The electrochemical measurements indicate that 3D flower-like MnCO3 microcrystals exhibit specific capacity of 384 mAh g(-1) at 0.2 C after 200 cycles, showing the significantly enhanced cycling performance than that of the obtained spherical MnCO3 microcrystals.

It shows that B-doping does not cause SWCNTs' structural distortion but can affect their electronic structures, and the interaction between carbon nanotubes and DNA bases enhanced with, turning the DNA bases adsorption on the surface of SWCNTs to chemical adsorption. N-doping has no obvious effects on the electronic structure of SWCNTs and the DNA bases, which can just be modified by physical adsorption on N-doped carbon nanotubes surface. The study predicts that the a few-electron elements such as B-doping have more advantages in DNA bases adsorption on the surface of the SWCNTs compared with the multi-electron central elements like N-doping.

Then, the doped titanium dioxide thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), SEM, and UV-Vis spectroscopy; the optimum coating cycle was evaluated by removal rates of COD and ammonia nitrogen in raw wastewater and secondary effluent. Moreover, the photocatalytic activity was determined by degradation efficiency of methyl orange. The results showed that TiO2M had desirable reusability and the photocatalytic activity was attractive under ultraviolet light irradiation. Furthermore, it is found that the amount of dopant in TiO2 was a key parameter in increasing the photoactivity. 1% Gd-doped TiO2M exhibited the best photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange with the removal rate reaching 85.55%. The result was in good agreement with the observed smaller crystallite size and profitable crystal structure (anatase phase). Besides, the TiO2M (0.8% Gd-doped TiO2M, 1% Gd-doped TiO2M, 10% I-doped TiO2M, and 5% I-1% Gd-doped TiO2M) with desirable photocatalytic activity at ultraviolet light irradiation was selected for the visible light photocatalytic experiments with taking methyl orange as the target pollutants. The results showed that all of them exhibited the similar photocatalytic activity after 7 h of sunlight irradiation (around 90% removal effect). In general, this research developed a very effective and environmentally friendly photocatalyst for pollutant degradation.

This study explored the relationships between attachment styles and smartphone addiction, and then investigated the mediating roles of dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem. A cross-sectional online survey was conducted with a voluntary college student sample in China (N = 297) to test the proposed hypotheses. It was found that anxious attachment styles positively predicted smartphone addiction. More importantly, dysfunctional attitudes and self-esteem were found to be mediators between anxious attachment styles and smartphone addiction, as well as close attachment styles and smartphone addiction. Deeper causes and implications are discussed.

We have studied the microscopic structure of MEL aqueous solution, dielectric properties, hydrogen-bond dynamics and the transportation properties. The MEL molecules weakly distorted the tetrahedral structures and the hydration shells have not been observed, which means that water molecules in the MEL aqueous solution find themselves is not a very unusual environment from that in the pure water. The temperatures dependent on the water structure, the permittivity, hydrogen-bond numbers and hydrogen-bond lifetimes decrease with the temperatures increase, and vice versa for the diffusion coefficient.

From those results, a facile process for the selective leaching of trivalent rare earth elements (RE(III)) from tetravalent cerium (Ce(IV)) was proposed. The roasted bastnaesite was used to leach 34.87% of RE(III) and 2.15% of Ce(IV) at 60 degrees C for 0.5 h with an acid concentration of 0.5 mol/L. This selective leaching process can be described by the shrinking-core model that follows the kinetic model 1 - 2/3 alpha - (1 - alpha)(2/3). Subsequently, the leached slag was hydrothermally treated and followed by thorough leaching with 4.0-mol/L nitric acid. Furthermore, the specific surface area of the final leached slag is 57.7 m(2)/g, which is approximately 650 times higher than that of raw ore. Finally, selective leaching of RE(III) (>90%) was achieved without using an organic solvent for extraction, whereas lower value Ce(IV) was presented in the leached slag (>92%).

In this work, BiFeO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 materials were prepared via a wet chemical method and the structure, morphology, and electrochemical performance of the materials were studied. The coating of BiFeO3 has no significant impact on the crystal structure of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. All BiFeO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 materials exhibit cubic spinel structure with space group of Fd3m. Thin BiFeO3 layers were successfully coated on the surface of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles. The coating of 1.0 wt% BiFeO3 on the surface of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 exhibits a considerable enhancement in specific capacity, cyclic stability, and rate performance. The initial discharge capacity of 118.5 mAh g(-1) is obtained for 1.0 wt% BiFeO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 with very high capacity retention of 89.11% at 0.1 C after 100 cycles. Meanwhile, 1.0 wt% BiFeO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 electrode shows excellent rate performance with discharge capacities of 117.5, 110.2, 85.8, and 74.8 mAh g(-1) at 1, 2, 5, and 10 C, respectively, which is higher than that of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (97.3, 90, 77.5, and 60.9 mAh g(-1), respectively). The surface coating of BiFeO3 effectively decreases charge transfer resistance and inhibits side reactions between active materials and electrolyte and thus induces the improved electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 materials.

It's a new index to describe the controlled teleportation schemes from the point of view of the controller. In this paper, we introduce two perfect controlled teleportation schemes and calculate the control power under different control particles. In scheme 1, the controller just controls one particle, which is particle 2. And in scheme 2, the controller controls the particles 2 and 3. They both use the cluster state as communication channel. By calculating the control power between two schemes, the control power of scheme 1 is 1/3, which is the minimal value of control power. On the contrary, the control power of scheme 2 is maximal, 1/2. Scheme 2 which controls two particles successfully promotes the control power comparing with scheme 1. It's evidently that controlling particle 2 is a necessary condition. And controlling particle 3 can gain the control power but the controller cannot control it solely.

In existing protocols of multi-hop teleportation, the more nodes, the smaller the success probability. In this paper, fusing the ideas of multi-hop teleportation and controlled teleportation, we put forward a scheme for implementing multi-hop controlled teleportation of single-qubit state. A set of ingenious three-qubit non-maximally entangled states are constructed to serve as the quantum channels. The information is perfectly transmitted hop by hop through teleportation under the control of the supervisors. Unit success probability can be achieved independent of channel's entanglement degree and the number of intermediate nodes. Only Pauli operations, single-qubit rotation, Hadamard gate, controlled-NOT gate, Bell-state measurement and single-qubit measurement are used in our scheme, so this scheme is easily realized in physical experiment.

The HES-based DVR concept integrates with one fast-response high-power superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) unit and one low-cost high-capacity battery energy storage (BES) unit. Structural design, fabrication process, and finite-element-modeling simulation of a 3.25 mH/240 A SMES magnet wound by state-of-the-art GdBCO tapes in SuNAM are presented. To avoid the internal soldering junctions and enhance the critical current of the magnet simultaneously, an improved continuous disk winding (CDW) method is proposed by introducing different gaps between adjacent single-pancake coil layers inside the magnet. About 4.41% increment in critical current and about 3.42% increment in energy storage capacity are demonstrated compared to a conventional CDW method. By integrating a 40 V/100 Ah valve-regulated lead-acid battery, the SMES magnet is applied to form a laboratory HES device for designing the kW-class DVR. For protecting a 380 V/5 kWsensitive load from 50% voltage sag, the SMES unit in the HES-based scheme is demonstrated to avoid an initial discharge time delay of about 2.5 ms and a rushing discharging current of about 149.15 A in the sole BES-based scheme, and the BES unit is more economically feasible than the sole SMES-based scheme for extending the compensation time duration.

This study also tested two different experimental protocols for determining dissolved N recalcitrance. An analysis of 15 effluent samples from five WWTPs, showed effluent concentrations and especially effluent composition varied greatly from one system to the other, with total nitrogen (TN) ranging between 1.05 and 8.10 mg L-1. Nitrate (NO3-) accounted for between 38 +/- 32% of TN, and ammonium accounted for a further 29 +/- 28%. All of these samples were dominated by dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN; NO3- + NH4+), and uptake experiments indicated the DIN fraction was as expected highly bioavailable. Dissolved organic N (DON) accounted for 20 +/- 11% for the total dissolved N in these effluents, and uptake experiments indicated the bioavailability of this fraction varied between 27 +/- 26% depending on the WWTP assessed. These results indicate near complete DIN removal should be the primary goal of ANR treatment systems. The comparison of bioavailable nitrogen (BAN) quantification protocols showed that the dissolved nitrogen uptake bioassay approach was clearly a more reliable way to determine BAN concentrations compared to the conventional cell yield protocol. Moreover, because the nitrogen uptake experiment was much more sensitive, this protocol made it easier to detect extrinsic factors (such as biological contamination or toxicity) that could affect the accuracy of these bioassays. Based on these results, we recommend the nitrogen uptake bioassay using filtered and autoclaved samples to quantify BAN concentrations. However, for effluent samples indicating toxicity, algal bioassays will not accurately quantify BAN. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Their crystal structure, photophysical and electrochemical characteristics were investigated. Four red or near-infrared luminescent compounds were obtained for 1 to 4 with emission peaks at 639, 632, 744 and 745 nm in solution at room temperature respectively, while emission spectra of 5 and 6 could not be measured. The X-ray structure of 1 and 5 showed that Pt(II)-Pt(II) distance were 2.9694 (3) and 2.8802 (3) angstrom respectively, which proved luminescence of the complexes benefited from metal-metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MMLCT) transitions.

D-Table attribute reduction concerns three hierarchical types, and only classification-based reduction is related to information-theoretic representation. Aiming at inducing comprehensive D-Table attribute reduction with hierarchies and information, this paper concretely constructs a D-Table's three-layer granular structures and three-way informational measures via granular computing and Bayes' theorem. With regard to the D-Table, the micro-bottom, meso-middle, and macro-top are hierarchically organized according to the formal structure and systematic granularity. Then, different layers produce different three-way informational measures by developing Bayes' theorem. Thus, three-way weighted entropies originate from three-way probabilities at the micro-bottom and further evolve from the meso-middle to the macro-top, and their granulation monotonicity and evolution systematicness are acquired. Furthermore, three-way informational measures are analyzed by three-layer granular structures to achieve their hierarchical evolution, superiority, and algorithms. Finally, structural and informational results are effectively illustrated by a D-Table example. This study establishes D-Table's hierarchical structures to reveal constructional mechanisms and systematic relationships of informational measures. The obtained results underlie the D Table's hierarchical, systematic, and informational attribute reduction, and they also enrich the three-way decisions theory. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

CdTe QDs were synthesized in aqueous solution by hydride generation (HG) for the first time, with H2Te gas being introduced into the aqueous medium containing Cd2+ ions. The gaseous precursor, H2Te, is generated on-line by reducing TeO32-with KBH4. The visible fluorescence from the CdTe QDs immobilized on paper was quenched by Ag+. A limit of detection (LOD) of 0.01 mu g mL(-1) and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 7) of 2.1% at a concentration of 1 mu g mL(-1) of Ag+ were obtained when using a commercial fluorescence spectrophotometer as the detector. In visual detection, as low as 1 mu g mL(-1) of Ag+ in antibacterial textiles and drugs can be easily discriminated from the blank with the naked eye. The proposed method has several unique advantages, including straightforwardness, rapidness, affordability and requirement of no equipment for visual detection.

However, the cross-/co-tier interference in HetNets also will severely influence the user throughput of both tiers. In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation and interference mitigation problem in cluster based orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) two-tier HetNets. In a typical cluster, one SBS is selected as the cluster head to allocate resources among all small cells to guarantee their throughput requirements. Hybrid access policy enables small cells to suppress the cross-tier interference and earn additional revenue from macrocells, but it also leads to decrease of available resources for small cell users (SUs). To compensate hybrid access SBSs for their resources loss, we impose hierarchical SU throughput constraints on the optimization problem, which guarantee these small cells more resources than closed access ones. Besides, the cross-tier interference constraint is also considered to protect the transmissions of macrocell users. Accordingly, a subgradient iteration based resource allocation algorithm is proposed. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm can satisfy SU throughput constraints of all small cells with different access policies and guarantee quality of service requirements of all accessed macrocell users in hybrid access small cells.

In this study, ruthenium nano particles (NPs) supported on alumina nanofibers (Ru/Al2O3-NFs) were synthesized by reducing the Ru(III) ions impregnated on Al2O3-NFs during AB hydrolysis. Results showed that the Ru NPs with an average size of 2.9 nm were uniformly dispersed on the Al2O3-NFs support. The as-synthesized Ru/Al2O3-NFs exhibited a high turnover frequency of 327 mol H-2 (mol Ru min)(-1) and an activation energy of 36.1 kJ mol(-1) for AB hydrolysis at 25 degrees C. Kinetic studies showed that the AB hydrolysis catalyzed by Ru/Al2O3-NFs was a first-order reaction with regard to the Ru concentration and a zero-order reaction with respect to the AB concentration. The present work reveals that Ru/Al2O3-NFs show promise as a catalyst in developing a highly efficient hydrogen storage system for fuel cell applications. (C) 2017 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In this work, the self-templating construction of a hollow amorphous CoMoS4 nanotube array on carbon cloth (CoMoS4 NTA/CC) is reported, using hydrothermal treatment of a Co(OH)F nanowire array on CC in (NH4)(2)MoS4 solution. When used as a 3D electrode for hydrogen evolution electrocatalysis, the resulting CoMoS4 NTA/CC demonstrates superior catalytic activity and strong long-term electrochemical durability in 1.0 M phosphate buffer solution (pH=7). It shows small onset overpotential of 21 mV and requires low overpotentials of 104 and 179 mV to drive geometrical current densities of 10 and 50 mAcm(-2), respectively. Density functional theory calculations suggest that CoMoS4 has a more favorable hydrogen adsorption free energy than Co(OH)F.

Robust efficiency analysis is a conservative approach that is concerned with an assured level of performance for an entity across all possible multiplier scenarios. In this study, we extend the robust efficiency analysis procedure to the situation where precise information on some input and output data is unavailable. Perfect efficiency analysis and potential efficiency analysis methods are developed to determine, respectively, the lower and upper bounds of an entity's robust efficiency rating. The concepts of robust efficiency are expanded to classify entities in consideration into three groups: perfectly robust efficient, potentially robust efficient and robust inefficient. Two approaches are presented to convert robust efficiency analysis models into linear programs. It is claimed that Data Envelopment Analysis and robust efficiency analysis together provide a comprehensive picture of an entity's relative efficiency. A computational experiment is conducted to compare the traditional efficiency analysis method with robust efficiency analysis in the presence of imprecise data. The results illustrate that perfect efficiency analysis exhibits a superior power of discrimination than potential efficiency analysis and that an entity recommended by perfect efficiency analysis has a satisfactory average performance.

However, in many cases, recombination has been found to adversely affect prediction accuracy. To address this problem, this study incorporates a feed forward neural network (FNN) into the EMD-based forecasting framework and brings forward the weighted recombination strategy to allow for one step ahead forward prediction. To justify and compare the effectiveness of the proposed model, four non-linear, non-stationary data series are applied and benchmarked using four well-established prediction model recombination methods. The results show that the proposed weighted EMD-based forecasting model observably improves forecast validity. This approach also has great promise for intricate and noise disturbed irregular and highly volatile time series predictions. (C)2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The stability of artificial soil layer and its supply of water and nutrients for plants is crucial for successful restoration. To evaluate the long-term effectiveness of OSSS, the texture, structure and nutrient availability of artificial soil were studied, various soil samples were obtained from three cut slopes with different restoration time (restored with OSSS in 1996, 2003 and 2007 respectively) and one natural developed slope (NS). The properties measured including soil particle size distribution (PSD), texture, fractal dimension of PSD (D-m), the bias (C-s) and peak convex (C-E) coefficients of aggregate size distribution, structure failure rate, bulk density, moisture, pH, soil organic carbon (SOC), calcium carbonate content, Available nitrogen (N-A), Available phosphorus (P-A), and Available potassium (K-A). The results showed that different restoration time resulted in significant differences in soil PSD, D-m, C-s, C-E, structure failure rate, bulk density, moisture, pH, N-A, and K-A. And these properties improved with increasing restoration age. However, there is still a huge disparity in soil texture, structure, and the availability of nutrients and moisture between the cut slopes and NS over a restoration period of up to 17 years, and this is caused by the little fine particles and the lack of slow release fertilizers and organic fertilizers in the artificial soil, resulting in poorer soil structure stability, retention and availability of moisture and nutrients on the cut slopes. Overall, the OSSS technique shows a long-term effectiveness in southwest of China, but there is still room for improvement. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, SX; Chang, HR; Zhou, JH				Wang, Shi-Xiong; Chang, Hao-Ran; Zhou, Jianhui			RKKY interaction in three-dimensional electron gases with linear spin-orbit coupling	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							REAL-SPACE OBSERVATION; FERROMAGNETISM; INVERSION; PHASE	We theoretically study the impacts of linear spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction between magnetic impurities in two kinds of three-dimensional noncentrosymmetric systems. It has been found that linear SOCs lead to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and the Ising interaction, in addition to the conventional Heisenberg interaction. These interactions possess distinct range functions from three-dimensional electron gases and Dirac/Weyl semimetals. In the weak SOC limit, the Heisenberg interaction dominates over the other two interactions in a moderately large region of parameters. Sufficiently strong Rashba SOC makes the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction or the Ising interaction dominate over the Heisenberg interaction in some regions. The change in topology of the Fermi surface leads to some quantitative changes in periods of oscillations of range functions. The anisotropy of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction in bismuth tellurohalides family BiTeX (X = Br, Cl, and I) originates from both the specific form of Rashba SOC and the anisotropic effective mass. Our work provides some insights into understanding observed spin textures and the application of these materials in spintronics.

The result shows that isoamethyrin has a strong affinity to uranyl than to plutonyl, which is derived from the bond formation between the f orbitals in two metal atoms and the ligands. Pu atom provides the less number of f orbitals but the more number of p orbitals than U atom, which leads to the weak interaction between Pu atom and the ligands. The calculation of TBE (Bonding Energy Total) shows that the isoamethyrin ligands have large deformation after coordination.

However, the practical application of sodium-ion batteries is hindered by the limited electrochemical performance of electrode materials, especially at the anode side. Here, we identify alkaline earth metal vanadates as promising anodes for sodium-ion batteries. The prepared calcium vanadate nanowires possess intrinsically high electronic conductivity (>100 S cm(-1)), small volume change (<10%), and a self-preserving effect, which results in a superior cycling and rate performance and an applicable reversible capacity (>300 mAh g(-1)), with an average voltage of similar to 1.0 V. The specific sodium-storage mechanism, beyond the conventional intercalation or conversion reaction, is demonstrated through in situ and ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. This work explores alkaline earth metal vanadates for sodium-ion battery anodes and may open a direction for energy storage.

It is found the annular beam is compressed more strongly due to the self-focusing effect as the beam obscure ratio increases. On the other hand, the self-focusing effect between annular, flat-topped and Gaussian beams is compared. It is shown that the self-focusing effect on the annular beam is stronger than that on flat-topped and Gaussian beams. However, the threshold critical power values of annular, flat-topped and Gaussian beams should be in sequence from small to large. Furthermore, the expression of the B integral of annular beams propagating from orbit to the ground in the atmosphere is derived, and the fitting equation related to the B integral of annular beams for maximal compression without filamentation is presented.

The YF3:0.125Eu(3+), 0.5%Bi3+ samples using NH4F, NH4HF2, LiF, NaF, KF, MgF2 CaF2, and BaF2 as fluoride source are abbreviated as S1-S8, respectively. Except for the sample S8, all the diffraction peaks of the other materials (S1-S7) can be indexed to pure YF3 with orthorhombic symmetry. Granule-like nanoparticles, truncated octahedron, octahedron, and bipyramid morphologies were observed in S1-52, S3-S4, S5-S7, and S8 samples, respectively. The grain size of the materials is positively correlated with the cationic radius in fluoride sources, which gives the values of 64 nm to 4.2 mu m. The schematic diagram showing grain formation process has been proposed on the basis of fluoride source-induced morphological evolution. The morphology dependence of fluorescence reveals that the NaF-controlled sample exhibits the strongest orange-yellow emission, while the emission intensity using NH4F as the fluoride source is the lowest. This work offers us a method to effectively control the shape and size of inorganic photoluminescent materials so as to improve the fluorescence by tuning their morphology using different fluoride sources. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that these luminescent nanoparticles can be used in luminescent ink.

J	Chen, ZR; He, ZR; Xu, YH; Yu, WH				Chen, Ziran; He, Zhanrong; Xu, Youhui; Yu, Wenhao			Density functional theory calculations of charge transport properties of 'plate-like' coronene topological structures	JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL SCIENCES			English	Article						Organic semiconductors; density functional theory; charge carrier mobility; ambipolar transport; coronene derivatives; topological structures	DISCOTIC LIQUID-CRYSTALS; MOBILITY	Charge transport rate is one of the key parameters determining the performance of organic electronic devices. In this paper, we used density functional theory (DFT) at the M06-2X/6-31G(d) level to compute the charge transport rates of nine coronene topological structures. The results show that the energy gap of these nine coronene derivatives is in the range 2.90-3.30 eV, falling into the organic semiconductor category. The size of the conjugate ring has a large influence on the charge transport properties. Incorporation of methyl groups on the rigid core of tetrabenzocoronene and hexabenzocoronene is more conducive to the hole transport of the molecule than incorporating methoxyl groups. The derivatisation of a 'long plate-like' coronene with methoxyl groups facilitates both hole and electron transport. This class of molecules can thus be used in the design of ambipolar transport semiconductor materials. JCSC-D-16-01407 SYNOPSIS Density functional theory was used to compute the charge transport rates of three series nine coronene topological structures at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d) level. Tetrabenzocoronene (series a) and hexabenzocoronene (series b) could be candidates for a hole-transporting (p-type) organic semiconductor material, and 'long plate-like' coronene topological structures (series c) could be used as an ambipolar transport material.

China is rich in coal resources and has a large amount of gas with a wide range of distribution. However, China experienced not only adverse effects on coal mining but also gas disasters in underground engineering construction, such as tunnels and chambers. With the increased number of tunnels passing through coal-bearing strata, the incidence of gas accidents is also rising. Therefore, the significance of preventing and mitigating gas disasters should be emphasized, and an effective risk assessment method for gas disasters should be established. On the basis of research on over 100 gas tunnels in China, a relatively ideal gas disaster risk assessment method and system for tunnels are established through the following measures. Firstly, geo-environmental conditions and gas situations were analyzed during construction. Secondly, qualitative analysis was combined with quantitative analysis. Finally, the influencing factors of gas disasters, including geological conditions, gas, and human factors, were investigated. The gas tunnel risk assessment system includes three levels: (1) the grading assessment of a gas tunnel during the planning stage, (2) the risk assessment of gas tunnel construction during the design and construction stages, (3) the gas tunnel outburst risk assessment during the coal uncovering stage. This system was applied to the dynamic assessment of gas disaster during the construction of the Zipingpu tunnel of Dujiangyan-Wenchuan Highway (in Sichuan, Southwest China). The assessment results were consistent with the actual excavation, which verified the rationality and feasibility of the system. The developed system was believed to be back-up and applied for risk assessment of gas disaster in the underground engineering construction.

With energy of each compound, we find that all heme Fe3+ and Fe2+ complex compounds axially coordinate the imidazoles by strong field in low-spin state. Meanwhile, binding energies were calculated, the structure feature and the frontier orbital distribution of complex compounds were also analyzed. On the basis of Marcus theory, the reorganization energy, matrix element and charge transport rate constant were calculated. The results show that the charge transport rate of the complex compound coordinated imidazole is greater than that of the complex compound coordinated 2-methyl imidazole, which indicates that the charge transfer between the imidazole and the heme iron is more favorable to the heme iron than the 2-methyl imidazole. The results are in good agreement with the experimental ones obtained by Battistuzzi.

The average dipole moment along the direction of applied field, (M), linearly increases with certain field strengths. The reinterpretation of the Kirkwood factor Gk and A associated with the static electric field is imperative. The external field method is more accurate for molecular liquids with dipole moments whereas the fluctuation method yields better performance for molecules with large permanent dipole moments. Finally, we find that the static electric field can prolong lifetimes of hydrogen bonds and increase the average hydrogen-bond number. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is shown that, if the underlying mapping has a separable structure with each component of the mapping being quasimonotone, then the Minty variational inequality has a solution. An example shows that the underlying mapping itself is not necessarily quasimonotone, although each of its components is.

The service station may be subject to failures randomly during serving customers and therefore is sent for repair immediately. The (p, N)-policy means that when the number of customers in the system reaches a given threshold value N, the deactivated server is turned on with probability p or is still left off with probability 1 - p. Applying the law of total probability decomposition, the renewal theory and the probability generating function technique, we investigate the queueing performance measures and reliability indices simultaneously in our work. Both the transient queue length distribution and the recursive expressions of the steady-state queue length distribution at various epochs are explicitly derived. Meanwhile, the stochastic decomposition property is presented for the proposed model. Various reliability indices, including the transient and the steady-state unavailability of the service station, the expected number of the service station breakdowns during the time interval (0(+), n(+)] and the equilibrium failure frequency of the service station are also discussed. Finally, an operating cost function is formulated, and the direct search method is employed to numerically find the optimum value of N for minimizing the system cost.

In this communication, we demonstrate that developing an amorphous borate shell on a NiCo2O4 surface can boost its OER activity in alkaline media. As a 3D catalyst electrode, a NiCo2O4@Ni-Co-B nanoarray on carbon cloth needs an overpotential of only 270 mV to achieve a geometrical catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, which is 100 mV less than that for a NiCo2O4 nanoarray. Notably, this electrode also demonstrates strong electrochemical durability, maintaining its activity for at least 100 h. The superior activity of NiCo2O4@Ni-Co-B is attributed to the amorphous Ni-Co-B shell on NiCo2O4 favoring the in situ electrochemical generation of more active species during water oxidation.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Three-way attribute reducts	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Three-way decisions; Attribute reducts; Three-way reducts; Quantitative reducts; Qualitative reducts; Relative dependency degree	UNCERTAINTY MEASURES; SET; DECISIONS; FUZZY; APPROXIMATION; MODEL; PRECISION	Three-way decisions are a fundamental methodology with extensive applications, while attribute reducts play an important role in data analyses. The combination of both topics has theoretical significance and applicable prospects, but rarely gains direct research at present. In this paper, three-way decisions are introduced into attribute reducts and thus three-way attribute reducts are systematically investigated. Firstly, classical qualitative reducts are reviewed by the dependency degree. Then, the dependency degree implements approximation analyses to be improved to a controllable measure: the relative dependency degree, which is monotonic to relatively measure the attribute dependency. Given an approximate bar, the relative dependency degree defines the applicable quantitative reducts, which approach, expand, and weaken the classical qualitative reducts. This type of quantitative reducts is actually the positive quantitative reducts for three-way reducts. Thus, three-way quantitative reducts are established by the relative dependency degree and dual thresholds. The positive, boundary, and negative quantitative reducts divide the power set of the condition attribute set and thus gain acceptance, noncommitment, and rejection decisions, respectively; they exhibit the potential derivation from the higher level to the lower level. Furthermore, three-way qualitative reducts are established by degeneration to implement three-way decisions, and three-way quantitative and qualitative reducts exhibit the approximation, expansion, and strength; by virtue of superiority analyses, three-way reducts improve the latent two-way reducts with only acceptance and rejection decisions. Finally, three-way reducts are practically illustrated by observing an example of decision tables. By developing the relative dependency degree with controllability, three-way reducts implement both a quantitative generalization for qualitative reducts and a structural completion for attribute reducts.

The composition and structure of the samples were well characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, elemental analysis, thermogravimetric analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X-ray, respectively. The experimental results indicate that these 3D flower-like architectures with diameter of about 4 mu m are composed of a large number of nanosheets. The presumed molecular formula of the cerium-based metal-organic framework is Ce-2(pztc)(H2O)(6). In addition, a possible mechanism for the formation of cerium pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylate architectures was proposed based on time-dependent experiments. Furthermore, the as-obtained flower-like cerium-based metal-organic framework architectures could be easily transformed into CeO2 microstructures with flower-like outlines through simply heat-treating in air.

Natural plant alkaloids exhibit multiple biological functions, including inhibition of cell proliferation, and may have potential anticancer activity. However, most natural alkaloids may not be suitable for human therapies owing to instability, poor dissolubility and potential side effects. To improve their anticancer activity and drug effect, the present study aimed to develop new alkaloid derivatives, the phenanthroindolizidine alkaloid compounds, and evaluated their potential antitumor effects on human cancer cells in vitro. Among the several newly synthesized analogues of phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids (PAs), the compounds YS306 and YS206 exhibited an increased growth inhibition activity on HepG2 liver cancer cells and on HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer cells, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations in the micromolar range. YS206 and YS306 (5 ae g/ml) both significantly induced cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase and notably decreased cell distribution at the G0/G1 and S phase. In addition, these two molecules significantly inhibited cancer cell migration, as analyzed by the wound-healing and Transwell assays. However, neither YS306 nor YS206 exhibited observable effects on apoptosis. Therefore, chemical structure modifications of natural PAs based on anticancer activity assessments may be feasible in the development of new cancer chemotherapeutic agents.

Dwarf bamboo is highly sensitive to water stress and often causes severe P deficiency in its growing soils due to the characteristics of shallower roots and expeditious growth. However, little is known about its photoprotective response to soil water deficit and the underlying mechanisms regulated by P application. In this study, a completely randomized design with two factors of two water regimes (well-watered and water-stressed) and two P levels (with and without P application) was arranged to investigate this issue in dwarf bamboo (Fargesia rufa) plants. Water stress not only decreased water status and photochemical activity but also increased lipid peroxidation due to reactive oxygen species, (ROS) accumulation irrespective of P application. In this case, thermal dissipation and antioxidative defense were promoted. Moreover, the role of the water water cycle under this stress still could not be ignored because it accounted for a large proportion of total energy (Jpsll). P application significantly enhanced photochemical activity accompanied by increased chlorophyll content in water stressed plants. Meanwhile, P application remarkably reduced thermal dissipation and hardly affected photorespiration and the water water cycle under water stress. Although P application only enhanced ascorbate (AsA) level, ROS, particularly hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and lipid peroxidation were significantly reduced in water-stressed plants. Therefore, P application can improve the photosynthetic capacity by regulating the redistribution of energy absorbed by PSII antennae and independently activating of the H2O2-scavenging function of AsA to alleviate oxidative damage in F rufa plants, thereby improving their survival under water stress conditions.

It is well known that the same EST demonstrates different effects in different climatic regions. In this study, the contribution rates of building envelopes in annual load and that of ESTs in energy saving are quantitatively investigated with the Finite Volume Method under unsteady-state conditions. A representative individual building is selected as the case model. Four typical cities of Shenyang, Beijing, Chengdu and Guangzhou are selected to represent different climatic regions of China. Results show that the critical parts where the energy-saving measures should be taken are roof and exterior wall. The contribution of external insulation dominates in the energy saving of the building models in all of the four climatic regions. In addition, shading device should be applied based on the climatic conditions. Natural ventilation is worth using in building design as it requires no capital investment except in severe cold zones in China. (c) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Usually, the length of correlation window is shorter than the period of the chosen FHSs due to the limited synchronization time or hardware complexity. Thus the study of the partial Hamming correlation properties of LHZ FHSs is of particular importance. In this paper, we prove the nonexistence of LHZ FHS sets with strictly optimal partial Hamming correlation in some conditions. In addition, employing the interleaving techniques, we present a construction of LHZ FHS sets with optimal partial Hamming correlation from m-sequences. The fundamental idea of our design is to use short individual m-sequences together with certain appropriate shift sequences to construct long LHZ FHS sets with optimal partial Hamming correlation. In particular, our construction gives new parameters not covered in the literature.

Herein, the OER activity of NiFe-LDH nanoarray on carbon cloth (NiFe-LDH/CC) in alkaline media is shown to be greatly boosted by an amorphous NiFe-Borate (NiFe-B-i) layer formation on NiFe-layered double hydroxide (NiFe-LDH) surface. Such a NiFe-LDH@NiFe-B-i/CC catalyst electrode only needs an overpotential of 294 mV to drive 50 mAcm(-2) in 1.0M KOH; 116 mV less than that needed by NiFe-LDH/CC. Notably, this electrode also demonstrates strong long-term electrochemical durability. The superior activity is ascribed to the pre-formed amorphous NiFe-B-i layer effectively promoting active species generation on the NiFe-LDH surface. This work opens up exciting new avenues for developing high-performance water-oxidation catalyst materials for application.

A homologous Fe-doped Co-based nanoarray incorporating complementary catalysts is shown to effect high-performance and durable water splitting in near-neutral media. Iron-doped cobalt phosphate borate nanoarray on carbon cloth (Fe-Co-Pi-Bi/CC) derived from iron-doped cobalt phosphide on CC (Fe-CoP/CC) through oxidative polarization behaves as a highly active bimetallic electrocatalyst for water oxidation with an overpotential of 382 mV to afford a catalytic current density of 10 mA cm(-2) in 0.1m potassium borate (K-Bi, pH 9.2). Fe-CoP/CC is also highly active for the hydrogen evolution reaction, capable of driving 10 mA cm(-2) at an overpotential of only 175 mV in 0.1m K-Bi. A two-electrode water electrolyzer incorporating Fe-Co-Pi-Bi/CC as anode and Fe-CoP/CC as cathode achieves 10 mA cm(-2) water-splitting current at a cell voltage of 1.95 V with strong long-term electrochemical durability.

Recent developments extended cross-couplings to reactions where one of the two partners connects with an aryl or alkyl carbon-hydrogen bond. From an economic and environmental point of view, oxidative couplings between two carbon-hydrogen bonds would be ideal. Oxidative coupling between phenyl and "inert" alkyl carbon-hydrogen bonds still awaits realization. It is very difficult to develop successful strategies for oxidative coupling of two carbon-hydrogen bonds owning different chemical properties. This article provides a solution to this challenge in a convenient preparation of dihydrobenzofurans from substituted phenyl alkyl ethers. For the phenyl carbon-hydrogen bond activation, our choice falls on the carboxylic acid fragment to form the palladacycle as a key intermediate. Through careful manipulation of an additional ligand, the second "inert" alkyl carbon-hydrogen bond activation takes place to facilitate the formation of structurally diversified dihydrobenzofurans.

However, studies on the multicolor tuning properties of Ln(3+)-doped fluoride are mainly concentrated on a complicated process using three or more dopants, and the principle of energy transfer mechanism is still unclear. Herein, multicolor tunable emission is successfully obtained only by codoping with Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions in beta-NaGdF4 submicrocrystals via a facile hydrothermal route. Our work reveals that various emission colors can be obtained and tuned from red, orange-red, pink, and blue-green to green under single excitation energy via codoping Tb3+ and Eu3+ with rationally changed Eu3+/Tb3+ molar ratio due to the energy transfer between Tb3+ and Eu3+ ions in the beta-NaGdF4 host matrix. Meanwhile, the energy transfer mechanism in beta-NaGdF4: x Eu3+/y Tb3+ (x + y = 5 mol %) submicrocrystals is investigated. Our results evidence the potential of the dopants' distribution density as an effective way for analyzing energy transfer and multicolor-controlled mechanism in other rare earth fluoride luminescence materials. Discussions on the multicolor luminescence under a certain dopant concentration based on single host and wavelength excitation are essential toward the goal of the practical applications in the field of light display systems and optoelectronic devices.

However, fabricating super-insulating yet mechanically robust and shape-memory aerogels remains challenging. Here, we integrate graphene oxide and a block copolymer to fabricate hybrid aerogels with triple networks and systematically study their mechanical and thermal properties. We show that the first network serves as sacrificial bonds and dissipates energy upon deformation, enabling the aerogels to have a high mechanical performance. The second network allows the aerogels to memorize the original permanent shape, and the third network is able to store strain energy and fix the aerogels in a temporary shape by vitrification. Remarkably, the strong phonon-scattering effect generated by the enormous interfaces between the three networks yields an ultra-low solid thermal conductivity of similar to 8 mW m(-1) K-1. The multi-functionality makes this class of hybrid aerogels particularly suitable for super-insulation applications on complex surfaces and in small spaces of buildings, industry and spacecrafts.

We reported a facile strategy to synthesize Rh nanoparticles deposited on 2D alk-Ti3C2X2 (X= O, F) (alk-Ti3C2X2 for short) MXene, which was prepared through the removal of the Al layers of Ti3AlC2 and post-treatment by alkalization. Modifying the Ti3C2X2 support by alkalization triggered the substitution of surface fluorine groups with surface oxygen species. The changes in the surface chemistry of alk-Ti3C2X2 effectively prevented particle aggregation to form well-dispersed Rh nanoparticles in small sizes with relative high metal dispersion, thereafter improving the hydrogen uptake capacity of the catalyst. Consequently, the Rh/alk-Ti3C2X2 catalyst significantly enhanced the catalytic performance for the HDC reaction, which could be assigned to the large number of active components from small Rh nanoparticles. This strategy provides a basis for investigating the use of MXenes as supports to synthesize well-defined metal nanoparticles in 2D layered structures for potential applications.

After that, the behaviors of the far-zone field of light waves on scattering from an anisotropic semisoft-boundary quasi-homogeneous medium are illustrated. It is shown that the spectral density of the scattered field is flattened-Gaussian-centered, owing to the semisoft boundary of the scatterer, while the spectral degree of coherence is Gaussian-centered, which is independent of the boundary of scatterer. It is also shown that both the spectral density and the spectral degree of coherence are anisotropic because of the anisotropy of the scattering medium.

Eugene			Stock market contagion during the global financial crisis: A multiscale approach	FINANCE RESEARCH LETTERS			English	Article						Contagion; Stock market; Global financial crisis; Multiscale analysis	INTERDEPENDENCE	We propose a multiscale correlation contagion statistic to test for stock market contagion during the global financial crisis (GFC) from the US to the other six G7 and BRIC countries. We find that cross-market correlations between the US and selected countries are conditional on the time scale. Stock market contagion during the GFC is dependent on both the recipient country and the time scale, e.g., contagion from the US to Japan, China, and Brazil occurs when the time scale is longer than 50 days or more. Our findings are important to international investors when they make decisions about global portfolio diversification. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Bayberry tannin(BT), an abundant natural plant polyphenol, was utilized to modifly the surface of the gamma-Al2O3 matrix and then stabilize Pt nanoparticles(NPs). The catalyst was systematically and specifically characterized by a collection of analytic tools including XRD, XPS, FTIR, TEM, and TG. It was found that the Pt NPs were envenly dispered on the gamma-Al2O3-C matrix. Meanwhile, when the catalyst was applied for selective hydrogenation of cinnamaldehyde(CMA) in the presence of KOH promoter in solvent, excellent catalytic performance was obtained. The selectivity to cinnamyl alcohol(CMO) reached 97.88% with 88.45% CMA conversion within 30 min in the presence of 0.037 mol/L KOH, without significant loss of catalytic activity even under cyclic measurements for 5 times. The excellent catalytic performances should be ascribed predominantly to the uniform and stable dispersion of Pt NPs on the gamma-Al2O3-C matrix and the excellent heat stability of BT.

The "Janus-like" tetrakis(alkoxy)triphenylene discogens containing electron withdrawing groups, such as cyano-, chloro- and fluoro-substituents, or electron-donating moieties, such as carbazole, thiophene and naphthalene at the opposite of the alkylated side were prepared in good to high yields. Polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigations revealed that six of the 14 discogens synthesized exhibit a hexagonal columnar mesophase. These chromophores emit bright blue light from 350 nm to 500 nm in solution depending on the extension of their pi-conjugation. In addition, all six columnar liquid crystals show non-dispersive time-of-flight photocurrent transportation, with charge carrier drift mobility in the range of 10(-3) to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1), higher or in the same range as their symmetrical hexa(alkoxy)triphenylene parent compounds.

Some desired properties and special cases of the developed operators are discussed in detail. Furthermore, considering the importance of the input arguments, we propose the picture 2-tuple linguistic weighted Bonferroni mean operator and picture 2-tuple linguistic weighted geometric Bonferroni mean operator. Finally, a practical example for selecting the service outsourcing provider of communications industry is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

In this work, we consider the cost for building and operating WRSNs. In the network, sensor nodes can be charged by mobile chargers, that have limited energy which is used for charging and moving. We introduce a novel concept called "shuttling" and introduce an optimal charging algorithm, which is proven to achieve the minimum number of chargers in theory. We also point out the limitations of the optimal algorithm, which motivates the development of solutions named Push-Shuttle-Back (PSB). We formally prove that PSB achieves the minimum number of chargers and the optimal shuttling distance in a 1D scenario with negligible energy loss. When the loss in wireless charging is non-negligible, we propose to exploit detachable battery pack (DBP) and propose a DBP-PSB algorithm to avoid energy loss. We further extend the solution to 2D scenarios and introduce a new circle-based "shortcutting" scheme that improves charging efficiency and reduces the number of chargers needed to serve the sensor network. We carry out extensive simulations to demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithms, and the results show the proposed algorithms achieve a low overall cost.

As exemplified in two data sets, the bone marrow transplantation study for leukaemia patients and the primary biliary cirrhosis study, patients could experience two competing events which may be correlated due to shared unobservable factors within the same cluster. With the presence of random hospital/cluster effects, a cause-specific hazard model with bivariate random effects is proposed to analyse clustered survival data with two competing events. This model extends earlier work by allowing random effects in two hazard function parts to follow a bivariate normal distribution, which gives a generalized model with a correlation parameter governing the relationship between two events due to the hospital/cluster effects. By adopting the GLMM formulation, random effects are incorporated in the model via the linear predictor terms. Estimation of parameters is achieved via an iterative algorithm. A simulation study is conducted to assess the performance of the estimators, under the proposed numerical estimation scheme. Application to the two sets of data illustrates the usefulness of the proposed model. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

By applying this criterion, we obtain some results for the global asymptotic stability of SEIRS models with constant recruitment and varying total population size. Based on these results, we give a complete affirmative answer to Liu-Hethcote-Levin conjecture.

J	Li, CG				Li, Changguo			Parallel Implementation of the Recursive Least Square for Hyperspectral Image Compression on GPUs	KSII TRANSACTIONS ON INTERNET AND INFORMATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						Graphics Processing Units (GPUs); compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA); recursive least square (RLS); parallel implementation; hyperspectral compression	LOSSLESS COMPRESSION; PREDICTION; ALGORITHM	Compression is a very important technique for remotely sensed hyperspectral images. The lossless compression based on the recursive least square (RLS), which eliminates hyperspectral images' redundancy using both spatial and spectral correlations, is an extremely powerful tool for this purpose, but the relatively high computational complexity limits its application to time-critical scenarios. In order to improve the computational efficiency of the algorithm, we optimize its serial version and develop a new parallel implementation on graphics processing units (GPUs). Namely, an optimized recursive least square based on optimal number of prediction bands is introduced firstly. Then we use this approach as a case study to illustrate the advantages and potential challenges of applying GPU parallel optimization principles to the considered problem. The proposed parallel method properly exploits the low-level architecture of GPUs and has been carried out using the compute unified device architecture (CUDA). The GPU parallel implementation is compared with the serial implementation on CPU. Experimental results indicate remarkable acceleration factors and real-time performance, while retaining exactly the same bit rate with regard to the serial version of the compressor.

For instance, the as synthesized PdNPs/ZIF-8 composites with diameter from 100 to 200 nm always maintain well-defined crystalline structure, and the PdNPs with small size of mil are well-dispersed in the crystal of MOFs without serious aggregations due to the BSA stabilizer. In Suzuki cross-coupling reactions of aryl halide, the PdNPs/ZIF-8 as catalysts have exhibited high activity and satisfied reusability owing to the use of BSA stabilizer as well as the fixing of MOFs matrixes. In addition; the strategy also can be extended to synthesize other kinds of MNPs/MOFs hybrid composites with tunable.particle size, which brings more opportunity for functional MOFs hybrid materials.

In our work, four kinds of biomass carbon materials derived from mushroom have been synthesized by a facile activation method using H3PO4, K2CO3, KOH and ZnCl2 as activators and the correlation between micromorphology characteristics and electrochemical properties in these biomass carbon materials have been systematically investigated. The electrochemical performance of lithium sulfur batteries is highly dependent on pore size, pore volume and surface area of activated carbon matrixes. The H3PO4-, K2CO3-, KOH- and ZnCl2- activated carbon materials exhibit the fluffy, dense, anomalous and molten morphologies, respectively, which induce the initial discharge capacities of 1357, 943, 1013 and 860 mAh g(-1) in their S/C composites; and their capacity retentions at 0.1C are 54%, 37%, 38% and 35% after experiencing 100 cycles, respectively. These may be attributed to the combination effects of surface area and pore size/volume in their carbon matrixes. Our study show that activator can effectively tailor pore size, pore volume and surface area of biomass carbon host materials and thus improve electrochemical performance of S/C composites for lithium sulfur batteries.

Through the ferromagnetic gating, an MR ratio of 12.7% is experimentally achieved in monolayer MoS2 under 90 kOe magnetic field at room temperature (RT). The observed MR ratio is much higher than that in previously reported nonmagnetic metal coupled with ferromagnetic insulator, which generally exhibited MR ratio of less than 1%. The enhanced MR is attributed to the spin accumulation at the heterostructure interface and spin injection to the MoS2 layers by the strong spin orbit coupling effect. The injected spin can contribute to the spin current and give rise to the MR by changing the resistance of MoS2 layers. Furthermore, the MR effect decreases as the thickness of MoS2 increases, and the MR ratio becomes negligible in MoS2 with thickness more than 10 layers. Besides, it is interesting to find a magnetic field direction dependent spin Hall magnetoresistance that stems from a combination of the spin Hall and the inverse spin Hall effects. Our research provides an insight into exploring RT MR in monolayer materials, which should be helpful for developing	[Jie, Wenjing; Yang, Zhibin; Zhang, Fan; Bai, Gongxun; Leung, Chi Wah; Hao, Jianhua] Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Jie, Wenjing] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Hao, JH (reprint author), Hong Kong Polytech Univ, Dept Appl Phys, Kowloon, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.	jh.hao@polyu.edu.hk	Hao, Jianhua/J-2806-2012; Leung, Chi Wah/T-7597-2019; Leung, Chi Wah (Dennis)/D-2085-2012; YANG, Zhibin/A-9846-2018	Hao, Jianhua/0000-0002-6186-5169; Leung, Chi Wah/0000-0003-0083-6273; Leung, Chi Wah (Dennis)/0000-0003-0083-6273; YANG, Zhibin/0000-0003-3620-4358; Jie, Wenjing/0000-0001-6687-1843	Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (GRF)Hong Kong Research Grants Council [PolyU 153031/15P]; Collaborative Research Fund (CRF) [HKU9/CRF/13G]; Collaborative Research Fund (PolyU Grant ) [E-RD5]; PolyU Internal Grant [1-ZE14]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [61604100]	This work was supported by the grants from Research Grants Council of Hong Kong (GRF No. PolyU 153031/15P), Collaborative Research Fund (CRF No. HKU9/CRF/13G, PolyU Grant No. E-RD5), PolyU Internal Grant (1-ZE14), and National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 61604100).		47	28	28	2	74	AMER CHEMICAL SOC	WASHINGTON	1155 16TH ST, NW, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA	1936-0851	1936-086X		ACS NANO	ACS Nano	JUL	2017	11	7					6950	6958		10.1021/acsnano.7b02253			9	Chemistry, Multidisciplinary; Chemistry, Physical; Nanoscience & Nanotechnology; Materials Science, Multidisciplinary	Chemistry; Science & Technology - Other Topics; Materials Science	FC2EI	WOS:000406649700043	28686411				2020-05-24

As (III) and Cd (II) were selectively adsorbed by nZVI and easily separated from the sample matrix by a magnet. The nZVI was then completely dissolved in hydrochloric acid prior to determination of As(III) and Cd(II) by double-channel HG-AFS. Under the optimum conditions, the detection limits of As (III) and Cd(II) were 0.002 and 0.0008 ng mL(-1), which were improved 40 and 38 folds compared to the conventional method, respectively. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) for 1 ng mL(-1) As (III) and Cd (II) were better than 2.0% (n = 7). The accuracy of the proposed method was validated by analyzing two certified reference samples, five water samples and two cell samples with satisfactory analytical results. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including high sensitivity, simplicity and minimized interfere. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The frequency response of the sensor is ranged from 1 kHz to 1 MHz. The sensitivity of the current sensor is 4.5 mV/A in a flat response zone from 1 kHz to 20 kHz with an error of 5%. Besides, the sensor exhibits superior temperature stability with a wide operational temperature range (room temperature to similar to 353 K). The sensor is also assembled with a high magnetic permeability material that is capable of shielding the DC biased magnetic field up to 2026 Oe. The environmental friendly sensing material and stable output characteristics make the proposed current sensor preferable for the high frequency current measurement. Besides the performance evaluation, the non-linear frequency response of the current senor is also investigated quantitatively from the aspects of impedance and conductivity. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Both microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops as well as angular distributions for the magnetizations in the thickness direction have been calculated, taking into account of realistic values of the interface anisotropy. The formula for the nucleation field has been derived analytically, where the nucleation field increases linearly with the interface anisotropy for a wide thickness region. While the nucleation field could change by more than 90% due to the influence of the interface anisotropy, the interface anisotropy has no effect on the pinning field or the coercivity, but it has some slight influence on the angular distributions. On the other hand, positive interface anisotropy enhances the remanence and the energy products, whereas negative interface anisotropy deteriorates both of them. Comparison with the experimental data justifies our calculation, indicating that negative interface anisotropy should be avoided in the experiment.

Results indicate that Ru/TiO2(B) shows high catalytic activity in hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of AB with an activation energy of 45.6 kJ mol(-1) and a turnover frequency number of 303 mol H2.(mol RU. min)(-1). The Ru/TiO2(B) exhibits a total turnover number of 15,377 in catalytic lifetime measurement in hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB before deactivation. The kinetic studies show that the hydrolysis of AB catalyzed by Ru/TiO2(B) is a first-order reaction with respect to Ru concentration, whereas it is a zero-order reaction regarding the AB concentration. The high catalytic activity of Ru/TiO2(B) demonstrates that TiO2(B) nanotubes are suitable media for nanoparticle immobilization. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

To avoid the energy hole problem for heterogeneous sensor networks, a feedback mechanism-based unequal clustering algorithm is proposed. In the initial stage of the network, this article divides the network into several layers with different layer heights by only considering the distance from nodes to the sink. Then, this article introduces a feedback mechanism and dynamically changes the size of each cluster according to the feedback value calculated by the sink. After the size of each cluster varies for several rounds, the energy consumption between each cluster will tend to be balanced. To save the energy consumption cost of receiving the sink feedback signal, this article proposes the termination condition for the feedback process. When the termination condition is satisfied, the feedback process finishes and the network turns into the stable clustering stage. The simulation results show that compared with the existing algorithms of data transmission, feedback mechanism-based unequal clustering algorithm can make better use of node energy and prolong the network lifetime.

J	Wu, SG; Li, LC; Li, Q				Wu, Shaogui; Li, Laicai; Li, Quan			Mechanism of NTP Binding to the Active Site of T7 RNA Polymerase Revealed by Free-Energy Simulation	BIOPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article							PARTICLE MESH EWALD; AMBER FORCE-FIELD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; NUCLEIC-ACIDS; TRANSLOCATION; GROMACS; MODEL	In genetic transcription, molecular dynamic details and energetics of NTP binding to the active site of RNA polymerase (RNAP) are poorly understood. In this article, we investigated the NTP binding process in T7 RNAP using all-atom MD simulation combined with the umbrella sampling technique. Based on our simulations, a two-step mechanism was proposed to explain NTP binding: first, substrate NTP in aqueous solution, which carries a magnesium ion, diffuses through a secondary channel of RNAP to attain a pore region, where it undergoes conformational changes to give a correct orientation; next, the NTP establishes initial basepairing contacts with the template nucleoside (TN). Our free-energy calculations suggest that both steps are spontaneous. This mechanism can easily explain the problem of NTP binding with different orientations. Moreover, it is found that the nascent NTP:TN basepair is fragile and easily broken by thermal disturbance. Therefore, we speculate that the-fingers domain will-be triggered to close, so as to create a steady environment for the next chemical step. The observations from the work provide valuable information for comprehensively understanding the mechanism of the basic step in genetic transcription.

The spinel Li(Mn, Ni)(2)O-4 and layered Li-2 SiO3 coexist in the composites with x= 0 and 0.05, whereas the materials with x= 0.15 and 0.25 consist of Li(Mn, Ni)(2)O-4, Li-2 SiO3 and layered LiNiO2; at x >= 0.35, the impurity phases of NiO and Ni6MnO8 are detected. A significant improvement in discharge capacity and rate performance of the materials has been caused by the simultaneous existence of LiNiO2 and Li2SiO3. The composite with x= 0.25 givesa very high initial discharge capacity of 168 mAhg(-1) in the potential range of 3-5 V and exhibits an excellent rate performance. Our study shows that the composites consisting of Li(Mn, Ni)(2)O-4, Li-2 SiO3, and LiNiO(2)w may be promising candidates for high-voltage and high-performance lithium-ion batteries.

The 2008 Wenchuan earthquake caused severe vegetation damage. In addition to simply detecting change, the magnitude of changes must also be examined. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were used to produce landscape maps before and after the earthquake and analyze the spatial-temporal change of the vegetation pattern. Landscape metrics were selected to quantify the spatial heterogeneity in a categorical map at both the class and landscape levels. The results reveal that the Wenchuan earthquake greatly increased the heterogeneity in the study area. In particular, forests experienced the most fragmentation among all of the landscape types. In addition, spatial heterogeneity in a numerical map was studied by using variogram analysis of normalized difference vegetation indices derived from Landsat images. In comparison to before the earthquake, the spatial variability after the earthquake had doubled. The structure of the spatial heterogeneity represented by the range of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) variograms also changed due to the earthquake. Moreover, the results of the NDVI variogram analysis of three contrasting landscapes, which were farmland, broadleaved forest, and coniferous forest, confirm that the earthquake produced spatial variability and changed the structure of the landscapes. Regardless of before or after the earthquake, farmland sites are the most heterogeneous among the three landscapes studied.

J	Wu, SG				Wu, Shaogui			Molecular dynamics simulation study of the "stay or leave" problem for two magnesium ions in gene transcription	PROTEINS-STRUCTURE FUNCTION AND BIOINFORMATICS			English	Article						molecular dynamics simulation; T7 RNA polymerase; magnesium ion; transcription mechanism; free energy	PARTICLE MESH EWALD; RESIDUE; GROMACS	Two magnesium ions play important roles in nucleotide addition cycle (NAC) of gene transcription. However, at the end of each NAC, why does one ion stay in the active site while the other ion leaves with product pyrophosphate (PPi)? This problem still remains obscure. In this work, we studied the problem using all-atom molecular dynamics simulation combined with steered molecular dynamics and umbrella sampling simulation methods. Our simulations reveal that although both ions are located in the active site after chemistry, their detailed positions are not symmetrical, leading to their different forces from surrounding groups. One ion makes weaker contacts with PPi than the whole protein. Hence, PPi release is less likely to take it away. The other one forms tighter contacts with PPi relative to the protein. The formed (Mg2+-PPi)(2-) complex is found to break the contacts with surrounding protein residues one by one so as to dissociate from the active site. This effectively avoids the coexistence of two ions in the active site after PPi release and guarantees a reasonable Mg2+ ion number in the active site for the next NAC. The observations from this work can provide valuable information for comprehensively understanding the molecular mechanism of transcription. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The surface morphology, the optical and electrical properties were measured by AFM (Atomic Force Microscopy), UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Lambda 950), and the four-probe method (RTS-9, Four Probes Technology). The erect of the sputtering power on the root-mean-square (RMS) surface roughness of Ag thin flims was analyzed. The experiment results showed that the RMS value was lowest in the range from 60W to 80 W. At the same time, the erect of the thickness on optical transmittance and sheet resistance was also investigated. We found the rough surface was prejudiced to inducing sheet resistance and enhancing the optical transmittance when the thickness of Ag thin flims was thin. In addition, the excitation of the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) was due to Ag nanoparticles (NPs) based on the analysis of the FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) simulation.

Influence of asymmetric magnetic perturbation on the nonlinear evolution of double tearing modes	PHYSICA SCRIPTA			English	Article						magnetohydrodynamics; asymmetric magnetic perturbation; double tearing mode	RESISTIVE INSTABILITY; SHEAR; PLASMAS; RECONNECTION; CONFINEMENT; STABILITY; GROWTH	The effects of asymmetric magnetic perturbation on the triggering and evolution of double tearing modes (DTMs) are investigated using nonlinear magnetohydrodynamics simulations in a slab geometry. We find that for reversed magnetic shear plasmas the resistive reconnection process induced by the initial perturbation at one rational surface can drive a new island at the other rational surface with the same mode number. The four typical states of the mode for the time evolution are found, and include: (i) a linear growth stage; (ii) a linear/nonlinear stable stage; (iii) an interactively driving stage; and (iv) a symmetric DTM stage. These differ from previous simulation results. Moreover, nonlinear DTM growth is found to strongly depend on the asymmetric magnetic perturbation, particularly in the early nonlinear phase. The initial perturbation strength scale of island width suggests that the left island enters into a Sweet-Parker growth process when the right island is sufficiently large to effectively drive the other. These results predict that although externally applied magnetic perturbations can suppress the neoclassical tearing mode they can also trigger new instabilities such as asymmetric DTMs.	[Xiong, G.

However, the performance can be much degraded due to inaccurate noise level estimation. By numerical and experimental study, we compare the noise level estimation of three different methods for BOTDA: calculating the standard deviation (STD) of the measurements, a filter-based estimation algorithm, and a patch-based estimation algorithm proposed in this paper, which selects weak textured patches of BOTDA signal and then estimates noise level using principal component analysis (W-PCA). The results show that W-PCA and the mean of STD can accurately estimate the noise level, while the filter-based method overestimates the noise level. Nevertheless, for BOTDA with distributed amplification, the STD has huge fluctuation along the length, while the W-PCA is relatively robust for its global consideration. Experimental results of an ultralong-distance BOTDA prove that the non-local means denoising processing based on W-PCA effectively removes the noise of a sensing system without signal distortion.

For this purpose, we firstly prove a very general existence result for generalized mixed variational inequalities, provided that the mapping involved has the so-called mixed variational inequality property and satisfies a rather weak coercivity condition. Finally, we establish the Tikhonov regularization method for generalized mixed variational inequalities. Our findings extended the results for the generalized variational inequality problem (for short, GVIP(F, K)) in spaces (He in Abstr Appl Anal, 2012) to the generalized mixed variational inequality problem (for short, GMVIP) in reflexive Banach spaces. On the other hand, we generalized the corresponding results for the generalized mixed variational inequality problem (for short, GMVIP) in spaces (Fu and He in J Sichuan Norm Univ (Nat Sci) 37:12-17, 2014) to reflexive Banach spaces.

Based on the lambda-fuzzy measure, we firstly get the weight vector of the criteria. Secondly, we propose the linear assignment method to acquire the optimal preference ranking of the alternatives according to a set of criteria-wise rankings and a set of criteria importance within the context of HFEs on the basis of the Hesitant Euclidean distance. Finally, a practical example about talent introduction is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

In this paper, we give a negative answer to a question of Anderson-Zafrullah. We show that if R is an LPI domain and S is a multiplicatively closed set, then R-S is not necessarily an LPI domain. Concerning a question of Bazzoni, we give a characterization of finite character for a finitely stable LPI-domain. We show that if R is a finitely stable LPI-domain, then every nonzero nonunit element of R is contained in only finitely many maximal ideals which are in T (R), and R is of finite character if and only if each nonzero nonunit element is contained in only finitely many nonstable maximal ideals. A maximal ideal m is in T (R) provided there is a finitely generated ideal I such that m is the only maximal ideal containing I.

A new incremental constraint projection method for solving monotone variational inequalities	OPTIMIZATION METHODS & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Random variables; random projection algorithm; cyclic projection algorithm; monotone plus mappings; variational inequalities	ALGORITHM; OPERATORS	In this paper, we propose a new incremental constraint projection algorithm for solving variational inequalities, where the underlying function is monotone plus and Lipschitz continuous. The algorithm consists two steps. In the first step, we compute a predictor point. This procedure requires a single random projection onto some set Xwi and employs an Armijo-type linesearch along a feasible direction. Then in the second step an iterate is obtained as the random projection of some point onto the set Xwi which we have used in the first step. The incremental constraint projection algorithm is considered for random selection and for cyclic selection of the samples wi. Accordingly, this algorithm is named random projection algorithm and cyclic projection algorithm. The method is shown to be globally convergent to a solution of the variational inequality problem in almost sure sense both random projection method and cyclic projection method. We provide some computational experiments and compare the efficiency of random projection method and cyclic projection method with some known algorithms.	[Xia, F.

It is shown that the spectral density and the spectral degree of coherence of the scattered field can be factorized as a product of two parts, the one is dependent on the polarization of the incident field, and the other is dependent on the characteristics of the medium. The medium-dependent part displays two reciprocity relations, i.e. the normalized spectral density of the scattered field is proportional to the Fourier transform of the normalized correlation coefficient of the scattering potential, and the spectral degree of coherence of the scattered field is proportional to the Fourier transform of the strength of scattering potential. An example of Gaussian-correlated, quasi-homogeneous, anisotropic medium is discussed to illustrate these reciprocity relations.

The as-prepared CM-BT adsorbent featured to a well-defined microfibrous morphology and highly distributed adsorption sites, which was highly efficient and selective for the adsorptive removal of Cr3+ from aqueous solutions. Based on batch experiments, the adsorption of Cr3+ on CM-BT was pH-dependent, and the optimized adsorption pH was determined to be 5.5. The adsorption capacity of CM-BT to Cr3+ was high up to 20.90 mg/g. The co-existing cations, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe3+ and Cu2+, exhibited no significant influences on the adsorption of Cr3+ on CM-BT. The adsorption kinetics were well fitted by the pseudo-second-order rate model (R-2 > 0.99) while the adsorption isotherms were well described by the Langmuir model (R-2 > 0.98). Importantly, CM-BT was effective for the continues treatment of low concentration Cr3+ (2.0 mg/L) contaminated wastewater. Before reached the breakthrough point (5% of the initial Cr3+ concentration, 0.1 mg/L), the treated volume was as high as 894 bed volume, manifesting the great potential of CM-BT in practical treatment of Cr3+ contaminated wastewater.

These linear variation regions of spin-polarization with bias are influenced by the barrier thicknesses, barrier heights and molecular fields in the spin-filter (SF) layer. Among them, the variations of thickness and heights of the insulating and SF barrier layers have influence on the value of spin-polarization and the linear variation regions of spin-polarization with bias. However, the variations of molecular field in the SF layer only have influence on the values of the spin-polarization and the influences on the linear variation regions of spin-polarization with bias are slight.

Local modulation of double optomechanically induced transparency and amplification	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; CAVITY OPTOMECHANICS; SLOW LIGHT	We consider the probe absorption properties in a mechanically coupled optomechanical system in which the two coupled nanomechanical oscillators are driven by the time-dependent forces, respectively. It is found that the mechanical interaction splits the transparency window for a usual single-mode optomechanical system into two parts and then leads to appearance of the double optomechanically induced transparency. The distance between the two transparency positions (the frequency for the maximal transparency) is determined by the mechanical interaction amplitude. This can be explained by using optomechanical dressed-mode picture which is analogue to the interacting dark resonances in coherent atoms. When the mechanical resonators are driven by the external forces, the transparencies in the double-transparency spectrum can be increased into amplifications or be suppressed by tuning the amplitude of the forces. Additionally, it is shown that the double transparencies or the amplifications oscillate with the initial phases of the forces with a period of 2p. These investigations will be useful for more flexible controllability of multi-channel optical communication based on the optomechanical systems.

Antioxidant ability of TBL showed a three-stage change tendency during fermentation, which was relatively consistent with change in chemical compositions. Rutin and quercetin were identified as remarkable contributors among fermentation. Both total polyphenols, rutin and quercetin was positively being correlated with antioxidant activity of TBL. Results indicated that fermentation time influenced antioxidant activity by altering content of TBL phenolic compounds, which showed a three-stage change law: augmenting at the early stage of fermentation, declining at the medium stage of fermentation, and slightly changing during the last stage. This tendency suggested that fermentation was a potent means to promote antioxidant capacity of agro-food unless fermentation time was controlled. This study may provide a theoretical basis for producing fermented foods with high bioactivity. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effects of Li2SiO3 on the phase structure, morphology and electrochemical performance of the materials were investigated. As x increases, the structure and electrochemical properties of the materials are tailored. The cathode material with x=0.10 delivers ultrahigh initial discharge capacity similar to 150.3 mAh g (1), which is 24.4% larger than that of the pristine LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (120.8 mAh g (1)). The Li2SiO3-composited LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 materials present an enhanced cycling stability, better rate performance and lower charge transfer resistance. These excellent electrochemical properties indicate that the compositing of fast Li+-ion conductor Li2SiO3 is an effective method to enhance the electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-based cathode materials.

Cubic ZnS (c-ZnS) and hexagonal ZnS nanoparticles (h-ZnS) were obtained by heating an aqueous solution of Zn(NO3)(2)center dot 6H(2)O and Na2S2O3 center dot 5H(2)O at different temperatures. When the system was heated at 65 A degrees C for 24 h, hexagonal crystal structure of ZnS nanoparticles, with size of 50-350 nm, was obtained, as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and selected-area electron diffraction. When the reaction temperature was 100 A degrees C under hydrothermal condition, c-ZnS nanoparticles were obtained and exhibited monodisperse nanoparticles with average size of 4 nm. Proper rate of S releasing tuned by the variation of pH value is believed to be critical to stabilize the hexagonal ZnS nanoparticles. Compared with large size of h-ZnS nanoparticles, c-ZnS nanoparticles show higher photocatalytic activity in degrading methyl orange (MO). The degradation efficiency of c-ZnS nanoparticles reaches 97% under UV irradiation for 120 min. The good ultraviolet absorbing ability, charge separation property, and large surface area of c-ZnS nanoparticles are believed to have a positive impact on improving the degradation rate and degradation efficiency of MO.

Temperature, on the other hand, is usually known to affect only the magnitude of a magnetic moment, rather than its sign or polarity (most magnets exhibit a monotonic increase in magnetization upon cooling below their magnetic phase transition temperature). As a result, temperature-induced magnetization reversal (i.e. magnetic pole inversion) remains a very rare phenomenon which lacks proper understanding and explanation because of the extreme difficulties encountered in controlling the thermodynamics of magnetization of classical metal or metal oxide magnets. Herein, we report an unusual magnetic pole inversion behaviour in multiferroic (1 - x) BiFeO3-xDyFeO(3) solid solution (alloy), which can be tuned by varying the concentration of the magnetic ion Dy3+ in the solid solution. It is found that the temperature-induced magnetic pole inversion occurs in a wide composition range (x = 0.14-0.90). Moreover, for the first time in any ferrites, multiple magnetic pole inversions are observed in the solid solution compounds of high Dy3+-concentrations. Our results may provide a better understanding of the temperature-and composition-induced magnetic pole inversion and related phenomena and point to new potential applications for magnetic and multiferroic materials.

In this study, we measured shortwave and longwave radiation levels, as well as quantities of Asian spruce (Picea schrenkinan) forest litter, over 3 snow study plots that representing an open environment, 20% forest canopy openness (20% FCO), and 80% forest canopy openness (80% FCO). The fractional litter coverage (lc) was obtained through the binarization of digital photographs of forest litter. The effects of forest litter on snow surface albedo (alpha), snow surface temperature (T-s), upward shortwave and longwave radiation (K-up arrow and L-up arrow), and sensible heat flux (H) were then analyzed. According to our results, the energy budget over snow surface influenced by forest litter principally due to forest litter forcing decrease and T-s increase. The effects of forest litter on the energy budget increased with time and lc. We found that forest litter exerted the most significant impact on K-up arrow and L-up arrow at daytime during the latter stages of the snowmelt period. The influence of forest litter on H was more apparent on windy days. The presence of forest litter increased gains in shortwave radiation and losses in longwave radiation and decreased gains in H. Compared to the simulated energy (K-up arrow + L-up arrow+H) over a snow surface without litter, the calculated energy decreased by -13.4 W/m(2) and increased by 9.0 W/m(2), respectively, at the 20% FCO and 80% FCO sites during the latter stages of the snowmelt period. Overall, forest litter facilitated snow surface energy gains at the 80% FCO site and impeded them at the 20% FCO site during the latter stages of the snowmelt period.

It was demonstrated that CNTs could efficiently activate PS for the degradation of 2,4-DCP. Results suggested that the neither hydroxyl radical (center dot OH) nor sulfate radical (center dot SO4-) was produced therein. For the first time, the generation of singlet oxygen (O-1(2)) was proved by several methods including electron paramagnetic resonance spectrometry (EPR) and liquid chromatography mass spectrometry measurements. Moreover, the generation of the superoxide radical as a precursor of the singlet oxygen was also confirmed by using certain scavengers and EPR measurement, in which the presence of molecular oxygen was not required as a precursor of O-1(2). The efficient generation of O-1(2) using the PS/CNT5 system without any light irradiation can be employed for the selective oxidation of aqueous organic compounds under neutral conditions with the mineralization and toxicity evaluated. A kinetic model was developed to theoretically evaluate the adsorption and oxidation of 2,4-DCP on the CNT5.

Here, the KstD from Gordonia neofelifaecis was expressed efficiently in Escherichia coli. E. coli cells expressing KstD(3gor) were subjected to the investigation of dehydrogenation activity for different steroids. The results showed that KstD(3gor) has a clear preference for steroid substrates with 3-keto-4-ene configuration, and it exhibits higher activity towards steroid substrates carrying a small or no aliphatic side chain than towards substrates having a bulky side chain at the C-17 atom. The recombinant strain could efficiently convert androst-4,9(11)dien-3,17-dione into androst-1,4,9(11)-trien-3,17-dione (with conversion rate of 96%). 1(2)-Dehydrogenation of androst4,9 (11)-dien-3,17-dione is one of the key steps in glucocorticoid production. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study reporting on the conversion of androst-4,9(11)-dien3,17-dione catalyzed by recombinant KstD; the expression system of KstD3(gor) reported here would have an impact in the industrial production of glucocorticoid in the future.

Herein, we report the synthesis of the bimetallic catalyst PtyCo1-y/Ti3C2X2 via a facile one-pot approach using Ti3C2X2 as the support. The in situ synthesized PtyCo1-y/Ti3C2X2 is subsequently applied as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane at 25 degrees C. Experimental results show that Pt0.08Co0.92/Ti3C2X2 exhibits excellent catalytic activity for the hydrolysis of ammonia borane with a high hydrogen generation rate of 100.7 L H-2 (min g(Pt))(-1) and turnover frequency of 727 mol H-2 (min mol(Pt))(-1) because of the synergistic effect between Pt and Co. Moreover, Pt0.08Co0.92/Ti3C2X2 could be recovered from the reaction mixture by a magnet and recycled at least seven times, thus showing its high recycling efficiency.

Nevertheless, the relationship among CO2 assimilation, photoprotective pathways and metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) remains unexplored in bamboo species. Changes in leaf gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, energy partitioning, antioxidative system and compounds related to ROS metabolism in Fargesia rufa plants subjected to drought and subsequent rewatering were analyzed. Drought resulted in a reversible inhibition of photochemistry, particularly net CO2 assimilation, and lipid peroxidation due to ROS accumulation. Meanwhile, photoprotective pathways, including the water-water cycle (especially for moderate drought), and adjustment in antenna pigments, thermal dissipation and antioxidative defense capacity at organelle levels (especially for severe drought), were up-regulated at the stress phase. Conversely, photorespiration was down-regulated after drought stress. As a result, rewatering restored most of the photochemical activity under drought, especially moderate drought. Moreover, thermal dissipation under severe drought was still operated for avoiding high ROS levels after rewatering. Therefore, the synergistic function of these photoprotective pathways except photorespiration can protect the photosynthetic apparatus from oxidative damage in response to varying intensities of drought stress when CO2 assimilation is restricted. This is helpful for the gradual recovery of photosynthetic capacity after rewatering. Thus, F. rufa plants can withstand drought and is capable of survival in such environment.

Use of the N,O-ligand derived from 2,2'-diphenylglycine afforded either 5 or the byproduct [Ph2NCH2(3,5-tBu(2)C(6)H(2)-O-2)AlMe2] (7). The known Schiff base complex [2-Ph2PC6H4CH2(3,5-tBu(2)C(6)H(2)-O-2)AlMe2] (8) and the product of the reaction of 2-diphenylphosphinoaniline 1-NH2,2-PPh2C6H4 with Me3Al, namely {Ph2PC6H4N[(Me2Al)(2)mu-Me](mu-Me2Al)} (9), were also isolated. For structural and catalytic comparisons, complexes resulting from the interaction of Me3Al with diphenylamine (or benzhydrylamine), namely {Ph2N[(Me2Al)(2)mu-Me]} (10) and [Ph2CHNH(mu-Me2Al)](2)center dot MeCN (11), were prepared. The molecular structures of the Schiff proligands derived from Ph2CHNH2 and 2,2'-Ph2C(CO2H)(NH2), together with those of complexes 5, 7 and 9-11 center dot MeCN were determined; 5 contains a chelating imino/phenoxide ligand, whereas 7 contains the imino function outside of the metallocyclic ring. Complex 9 contains three nitrogen-bound Al centres, two of which are linked by a methyl bridge, whilst the third bridges the N and P centres. In 10, the structure resembles 9 with a bridging methyl group, whereas the introduction of the extra carbon in 11 results in the formation of a dimer. All complexes have been screened for their ability to promote the ring-opening polymerization (ROP) epsilon-caprolactone, delta-valerolactone or rac-lactide, in the presence of benzyl alcohol, with or without solvent present. Reasonable conversions were achievable at room temperature for epsilon-caprolactone when using complexes 7, 9 and 12, whilst at higher temperatures (80-110 degrees C), all complexes produced good (> 65 %) to quantitative conversions over periods as short as 3 min, albeit with poor control. In the absence of solvent, conversions were nearly quantitative at 80 degrees C in 5 min with better agreement between observed and calculated molecular weight (M-n). For rac-lactide, conversions were typically in the range 71-86 % at 110 degrees C in 12 h, with poor control affording atactic polylactide (PLA), whilst for delta-valerolactone more forcing conditions (12-24 h at 110 degrees C) were required for high conversion. Co-polymerization of epsilon-caprolactone with rac-lactide afforded co-polymers with appreciable lactide content (35-62.5 %); the reverse addition was ineffective, affording only (polycaprolactone) PCL.

Most species of the genus carry all kinds of pathogenic bacteria to human being. They are traditionally considered to be a least understood group. The complete mitochondrial genome of the White-Footed Indochinese Rat, Rattus nitidus was determined in this study. The characterization of mitochondrial genomes of Rattus genus was also analyzed based on comprehensive comparison. The result of evolutionary patterns of protein-coding genes (PCGs) suggested purifying selection was the predominant evolutionary forces in the mitochondrial genomes of Rattus genus. The NADH dehydrogenase 4 gene (ND4) showed a highly elevated Ka/Ks ratio compared to the other protein-coding genes, which indicated ND4 was most likely under relaxed selection pressure: Phylogenetic analysis provided a well-supported outline of Rattus genus, and revealed two groups in the genus.

Emergency patients have non-preemptive priority access to service. The service time of each CT scanner follows an Erlang distribution by data analysis from this hospital. We develop an M/E-k/1 queueing model with emergency non-preemptive priority. Firstly, the expected waiting time of the jth phase regular patient in the waiting queue is given by Laplace transform. Using this and generating function of the steady-state of phase distribution, the expected waiting time of an arbitrary regular patient is obtained. A total cost function which includes the penalty cost for unutilized medical resources and waiting cost of regular patients is constructed. The optimal arrival rate of regular patients so as to minimize the total cost is given by Kuhn-Tucker condition. Some numerical examples which are based on real data are given.

The MnO@Mn3O4 core-shell NPs with varied radius of MnO core (R-MnO) and thickness of Mn3O4 shell (TMn3O4) have been synthesized by in-situ oxidation of the pure MnO NPs in organic solution containing a mild oxidant at different temperatures. The exchange bias effect can be tuned by changing the R-MnO (TMn3O4) of the MnO@Mn3O4 core-shell NPs. The strongest exchange coupling effect of both 17.2 and 25.0 nm MnO@Mn3O4 core-shell NPs occur when R-MnO=TMn3O4=R/2. It is expected that the finding of the control of exchange bias effect by varied R-MnO and TMn3O4 in inverted core-shell NPs is helpful for the further understanding of the exchange bias mechanism.

We show that the spectrum of the scattered field, in general, changes with the scattering azimuthal angle, displaying rotational nonsymmetry. The influence of the orientation of the particle on the spectrum of the scattered field is discussed, and the relationship between the orientation of scattering particle and the distribution of the relative spectral shift of the scattered field is investigated.

Applying the fractional Fourier transform operator and Laplace transform technique, we obtain the exact expressions of system stationary state response. By studying the impacts of the external parameters, including the chirp rate and centroid frequency of LFM driving signal, and the internal parameters, including the system intrinsic frequency, noise intensity, and correlation rate of the internal noise, we find the non-monotonic behaviors of the output amplitude. The results indicate that the wide sense of SR phenomena occurs in the proposed LFM signal driving stochastic dynamical system.

J	Yu, MM; Tang, YH				Yu, Miaomiao; Tang, Yinghui			Optimal replacement policy based on maximum repair time for a random shock and wear model	TOP			English	Article						Phase-type distribution; Finite support; delta shock and wear model; Maximum repair time; Average cost rate	PERIODIC REPLACEMENT; MINIMAL REPAIR; SYSTEM; BEHAVIOR; COSTS	We study a shock and wear model in which the system can fail due to the frequency of the shocks caused by external conditions, or aging and accumulated wear caused by intrinsic factors. The external shocks occur according to a Bernoulli process, i.e., the inter-arrival times between two consecutive shocks follow a geometric distribution. Once the system fails, it can be repaired immediately. If the system is not repairable in a pre-specific time D, it can be replaced by a new one to avoid the unnecessary expanses on repair. On the other hand, the system can also be replaced whenever its number of repairs exceeds N. Given that infinite operating and repair times are not commonly encountered in practical situations, both of these two random variables are supposed to obey general discrete distribution with finite support. Replacing the finite support renewal distributions with appropriate phase-type (PH) distributions and using the closure property associated with PH distribution, we formulate the maximum repair time replacement policy and obtain analytically the long-run average cost rate. Meanwhile, the optimal replacement policy is also numerically determined by implementing a two-dimensional-search process.

All the ceramics can be well sintered at a low sintering temperature of 980 A degrees C for 2 h. The introduction of NdCoO3 into BiFeO3-BaTiO3 induces a dramatic enhancement in the piezoelectricity, multiferroicity and magnetoelectric effect of the materials. After the addition of 1.0-3.0 mol% NdCoO3, the ceramics possess a morphotropic phase boundary of rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases and exhibit high Curie temperature (similar to 486-605 A degrees C), strong piezoelectricity, good ferroelectricity and excellent temperature stability of piezoelectricity. The greatly enhanced magnetism with M (r) = 0.4229 emu/g and M (s) = 2.7186 emu/g is obtained in the ceramic with 8.0 mol% NdCoO3, almost six times larger than that of an undoped ceramic. The ceramic with 2.0 mol% NdCoO3 shows a strong magnetoelectric effect (alpha (33) = 750 mV cm(-1) Oe(-1)). The practical application potential of the present materials has also been preliminarily demonstrated by mimicking current monitoring. Our results suggest that the present ceramics may have potential applications in advanced lead-free piezoelectric and/or multiferroic devices.

Microstructures, luminescent and magnetic properties of the as- fabricated microcrystals were characterized by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, photoluminescence spectroscopy and Vibrating Sample Magnetometer. Influence of sintering temperature and sintering time on the microstructures, luminescent and magnetic properties of LiFe(WO4)(2) microcrystals were studied. Below the sintering temperature 800 A degrees C, the prepared samples exhibited spherical-like morphology. The crystallinity and purity of the microcrystals increased with increasing the sintering temperature. At higher 800 A degrees C, the observed morphology of the obtained microcrystalline turned to be rods-like. All the LiFe(WO4)(2) microcrystals exhibit the alike broad emission peak centered at 390 nm under excitation of 242 nm ultraviolet light except for difference in emission intensity. Due to the good crystallinity and microstructures, LiFe(WO4)(2) microcrystals fabricated at 800 A degrees C possess the maximum emission intensity. On the premise of the optimal sintering temperature (800 A degrees C) and the predetermined range of sintering time (1-9 h), the sintering time has little influence on the microstructures and luminescent properties of the LiFe(WO4)(2) microcrystals. In addition, all the well crystallized LiFe(WO4)(2) microcrystals exhibit paramagnetism at room temperature.

All target compounds 6a-k self assemble into a liquid crystalline phases having high clearing temperatures and broad phase ranges over 200 degrees C, and exhibit green luminescence both in solution and solid states. On cooling from the isotropic phase, compounds 6d-e and 6i-j containing the branched N-alkyl chain show only one peak for the isotropic to mesophase transition which is stable down to -50 degrees C. Comparison of 6a's mesomorphic behaviors and photophysical properties to a known hexahexyloxy-triphenylene (la) and the parent compound (4a) demonstrates the importance of peripherally attached functional groups in stabilizing columnar mesophases and inducing long-wavelength emission. Both the experimental results and computational calculations show that suitable peripheral functionalization of the discotic liquid crystal molecules not only results in significant differences in mesogenic behavior of the molecules, but also renders the molecules with the interesting optoelectronic properties, including large Stokes shifts and low-lying LUMO energy levels.

By constructing a constrained variational problem, we get a refined Gagliardo-Nirenberg inequality and the best constant for this inequality. We thus derive two conclusions. Firstly, by establishing and analyzing the invariant manifolds, we obtain a new criteria for global existence and blowup of the solutions. Secondly, we get other sufficient condition for global existence with the discussing of the Bootstrap argument. And based on these two conclusions, we also deduce so-called energy-mass control maps, which expose the relationship between the initial data and the solutions. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

An Improved Racetrack Structure for Transporting a Skyrmion	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							MAGNETIC SKYRMIONS; ROOM-TEMPERATURE; MNSI NANOWIRES; DYNAMICS; MOTION; STABILITY; GEOMETRY; FIELD	Magnetic skyrmions are promising building blocks for next generation data storage due to their stability, small size and extremely low currents to drive them, which can be used instead of traditional magnetic domain walls to store information as data bits in metalic racetrack memories. However, skyrmions can drift from the direction of electron flow due to the Magnus force and thus may annihilate at the racetrack edges, resulting in the loss of information. Here we propose a new skyrmion-based racetrack structure by adding high-K materials (materials with high magnetic crystalline anisotropy) at the edges, which confines the skyrmions in the center region of the metalic racetrack efficiently. This design can overcome both the clogging and annihilation of skyrmions according to our micromagnetic simulation, which occur normally for skyrmions moving on a racetrack under small and large driving currents, respectively. Phase diagrams for skyrmion motion on the proposed racetrack with various values of current density and racetrack edge width have been calculated and given, showing that skyrmions can be driven at a high speed (about 300 m/s) in the racetrack under relatively smaller driving currents. This design offers the possiblity of building an ultrafast and energy-efficient skyrmion transport device.	[Lai, P.; Zhao, G. P.; Tang, H.; Ran, N.; Wu, S.

This system can be totally governed by a two-mode Dicke-lattice model, which includes all of the counter-rotating terms and therefore works well in the ultrastrong coupling regime achieved in recent experiments. Attributed to its special atom-photon coupling scheme, this model supports a global conserved excitation and a continuous U(1) symmetry, rather than the discrete Z(2) symmetry in the standard single-mode Dicke-lattice model. This distinct change of symmetry via adding an extra photon mode strongly impacts the nature of photon localization and delocalization behavior. Specifically, the atom-photon interaction features stable Mott-lobe structures of photons and a second-order superfluid-Mott-insulator quantum phase transition, which share similaritieswith the Jaynes-Cummings-lattice and Bose-Hubbard models. More interestingly, the Mott-lobe structures predicted here depend crucially on the atom number of each site. We also show that our model can be mapped into a continuous XX spin model. Finally, we propose a scheme to implement the introduced cavity array in circuit quantum electrodynamics. This work broadens our understanding of strongly correlated photons.

Full optimizations with semi-empirical dispersion correction were performed in spectral computations and vibrational mode assignments. For comparison, partial optimizations with pure density functional theory were conducted in parallel. Results indicate that adding long-range dispersion correction to the standard DFT better reproduces the measured THz spectra than the popular partial optimizations. The main origins of the observed absorption features were also identified. Moreover, a coupled-oscillators model was proposed to explain the experimental observation of the unusual spectral blue-shift with the increase of temperature. Such coupled-oscillators model not only provides insights into the temperature dynamics of non-bonded interactions but also offers an opportunity to better understand the physical mechanisms behind the unusual THz spectral behaviors in taurine. Particularly, the simulation approach and novel coupled-oscillators model presented in this work are applicable to analyze the THz spectra of other molecular systems. Published by AIP Publishing.

The results indicate that the mechanism of the title reactions is not the radical mechanism or stepwise SNAr pathway, but the concerted SNAr pathway with a transition state, which is compared with the conclusion of Bolm et al. The reactivity of the title reactions can not be interpreted by the geometric looseness or natural population analysis. Multi parameter fitting reveals that the reactivity of the title reactions is controlled mostly by the regional nucleophilicity index. omega(-)(N10) of the nucleophile N10 atom or highest occupied molecular orbital energy E-HOMO of the reactant, the other factor is the charges of the nucleophilic atom N10, while the charges of the C2 atom and the geometric looseness L% have almost no effect on the reaction energy barrier. The relative energies and the reactivity of the title reactions attained at MP2/6-311+G**//B3LYP/6-311+G** level of theory are better agreement with the experimental results compared with the other methods.

There were two discontinuities in the refractive index at similar to 65 to 92 GPa and similar to 144 to 163 GPa, respectively. Moreover, above the Hugoniot elastic limit, the pressure dependence of the refractive index was divided into three segments, and there were large differences in their pressure-change trends: the refractive index decreased evidently with pressure in the first segment (similar to 20 to 65 GPa), remained nearly constant from similar to 92 to similar to 144 GPa in the second segment, and obviously increased with pressure in the last segment (similar to 163 to 210 GPa). Our first-principles calculations suggest that the observed discontinuities were closely related to the corundum-Rh2O3(II) and Rh2O3(II)-CaIrO3 structural transitions, and the shock-induced vacancy point defects could be one factor causing these great discrepancies in pressure-change trends. This work provides sapphire refractive-index information in a megabar-pressure range and clear evidence of its shock structural transitions. This not only has a great significance for the velocity correction of laser interferometer experiments and the analysis of sapphire high-pressure properties but also indicates a possible approach to explore the shock transitions of transparent materials.

It is found that an increase of the salinity in the seawater causes the more severe thermal blooming. As compared with the wavelength, the absorption coefficient is the main factor that dominates the thermal blooming because the absorption coefficient is very high in the seawater. In the seawater the thermal blooming becomes more severe for the wavelength corresponding to the higher absorption coefficient. Furthermore, both the behavior of the thermal blooming effect and the main factor dominating the thermal blooming effect in the shallow sea region are different from those in the deep sea region. In the shallow sea region, the dependence of the thermal blooming on the depth is not monotonic as the time increases. However, in the deep sea region, the thermal blooming effect becomes more severe monotonously as the depth increases. The physical explanations for the main results obtained in this paper are presented.

We found that, for the standard frequency-comb-based BOTDA, the use of a double-sideband (DSB) pulse generates a series of pulse pairs that simultaneously propagate along the sensing fiber, leading to a nonlinear interaction between the two sidebands of each frequency comb pulse, and a significant splitting of the Brillouin gain spectrum (BGS). This problem prevents its application in high-spatial-resolution sensing due to the higher pulse power requirement. Thus, one of the sidebands of DSB pulse was proposed for greatly suppressing the BGS distortion. In combination with the phonon preexcitation technique based on phase-shifted pulse, a sensor with a spatial-resolution approximately 60 cm along a fiber approximately 592 m in length was demonstrated. Furthermore, we explored the detailed performance of long-distance sensing by frequency-combbased BOTDA. The use of a frequency comb for the probe wave can suppress the pulse distortion and non-local effect, which is helpful for extending the sensing distance. A spatial resolution of approximately 6 m along a sensing fiber approximately 74.2 km in length was successfully demonstrated.

It is noted that the maximal emission peak value for dinuclear complex 2 is at 609 nm, which has red-shift of about 63 nm compared with its analogue mononuclear complexes 1 and 3, although they seem somewhat analogue in lowest energy absorption band. To examine the cause of anomalous lower emission for dinuclear complex 2, the single crystals for complexes 2, 3 and 4 were grown from dichloromethane and methanol solution. It is found that dinuclear platinum (II) complexes 2 incorporating 2,3-diphenylpyrazine-based bridging ligand has more twisted conformation in the ground than its mononuclear analogue, complexes 3, which has similar structure with complex 1. Furthermore,lowest energy band for dinuclear complex 2 in exciting spectrum shows red-shift of 18 nm compared with its absorption spectrum. The twisted geometry in ground and red-shifted exciting spectrum make us infer reasonably that dinuclear complex 2 may undergo a more profound change from twisted geometry to planar conformation before emission, which led a lower triplet excited sate, resulting in the red-shifted emission of the dinuclear complex 2	[Luo Kai-Jun; Geng Hao; Zhang Cheng-Yang; Ni Hai-Liang; Li Quan] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China	Luo, KJ; Li, Q (reprint author), Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Chem & Mat Sci, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China.	luo-k-j007@163.com; liquan6688@163.com						31	2	2	0	10	CHINESE CHEMICAL SOC	BEIJING	C/O DEPT INT AFFAIRS, SECRETARY OF CHEM SOC, PO BOX 2709, BEIJING 100080, PEOPLES R CHINA	1001-4861			CHINESE J INORG CHEM	Chin.

Under 401 nm excitation, GdPO4 center dot H2O:xSm(3+) displays a typical emission band with several peaks at 560, 596, and 640 nm. For the optimal sample of GdPO4 center dot H2O:1.75%Sm3+, as the annealing temperature was increased from 300 to 800 degrees C, the compound transformed from GdPO4 center dot H2O with a hexagonal symmetry to anhydrous GdPO4 with a monoclinic symmetry, and the morphologies varied from nanorods to ellipse-like shapes. The length of the nanorods was about 200 nm, whereas the ellipse-like shape exhibited a length of 100 nm and a diameter of 50 nm. The luminescent intensity was enhanced with the increased annealing temperature because the compound transformed from GdPO4 center dot H2O to anhydrous GdPO4 and the non-radiative transition was reduced due to variation in the morphology. Moreover, GdPO4 center dot H2O:1.75%Sm3+ exhibits paramagnetic performance. In addition, the potential applications in bioimaging and MRI were investigated.

In this work, the electronic structures of sulphur (S) and nitrogen (N) co-doped CsTaWO6 have been studied in the framework of density functional theory, in particular the S/N co-doping effect has been investigated. It is found that, (i) S/N co-dopants prefer to be separated; (ii) middle-gap states are introduced by Ne and S-dopant at the edges of valence band and conduction band; and (iii) Co-doping not only narrows the band gap, but also promotes the separation of photo-excited electrons and holes. Feature (iii) has been identified as a key reason why S/N co-doped CsTaWO6 is more efficient in photocatalytic water-splitting. A general doping strategy has been further suggested: co-dopants which can dominate the frontier states and favour to be separated can offer excellent photocatalysis performance.

Motion of Skyrmions in Well-Separated Two-Lane Racetracks	SPIN			English	Article						Skyrmion; two-lane racetrack; magnetocrystalline anisotropy	DYNAMICS; CONVERSION; LATTICE	Magnetic skyrmions are topological structures which can be used to store information as data bits in metallic racetrack memories. Their good properties, such as their stability, small size and low currents needed to drive them make them better candidates than traditional magnetic domain walls for the building of the next generation data storage. A skyrmion racetrack memory has been suggested, with the binary data encoded in the distance between skyrmions when the racetrack is a single lane. Here, we propose a new skyrmion-based two-lane racetrack structure separated by a high-K (high magnetocrystalline anisotropy) middle lane, which confines the skyrmions in their respective lanes. This design gives a new data presentation for the skyrmions on the racetrack. Phase diagrams for the skyrmion motion on the proposed racetrack as functions of the current density, middle lane anisotropy, middle lane width and DMI constant have been calculated and given, demonstrating that skyrmions can be driven in different lanes of the racetrack. This design offers the possibility of building an ultrafast and energy-efficient skyrmion transport device.	[Lai, P.; Zhao, G. P.; Wu, S.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states and products were calculated at the B3LYP/6-311G(d) level. The vibration analysis and the IRC analysis verified the authenticity of transition states. The reaction processes were confirmed by the changes of charge density at the bond forming critical point. The results indicated that protonic acid is an effective catalyst in the synthesis of (4R,5S,8as)4,5,8a-triphenylhexahydropyrimido[4,5-d]pyrimidine-2,7(1H,3H)-dione from benzaldehyde, urea and acetophenone. The activation energy of reaction with protonic acid decreased by 104.3 kJ mol(-1) compared with that of the reaction without it. The mechanism of reaction with catalyst protonic acid differs from that of reaction without it.

Methods: The essential oil was extracted using the modified steam-distillation extraction method, and its chemical components were determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The effect of the essential oil on proliferation of SMMC-7721 cells was studied by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)- 2,5-diphenyl-2-H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, with L02 and HeLa cells serving as control groups. Results: GC-MS results show that the essential oil of E. dense contains 40 components. Thirty seven components were identified and accounted for 98.39 % of the essential oil. The two main components were rosefuran epoxide (53.12 %) and 2-ethyl imidazole (29.8 %). The oil significantly inhibited cell proliferation in a concentration-and time-dependent manner (p < 0.05). SMMC-7721 cells were more inhibited than L02 and HeLa cells by the oil, with half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of 26.23 and 25.46 mu g/mL after 8-h and 24-h treatments, respectively. Conclusion: Out of the 40 chemical components of the essential oil of E. dense, rosefuran epoxide and 2-ethyl imidazole were the most abundant. The oil has a significant anti-tumor effect on SMMC-7721 cells, and thus has a potential to be developed as an anti-liver cancer drug.

Effects of microstructure design on aluminum surface hydrophobic and ice-retarding properties	ASIA-PACIFIC JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERING			English	Article						superhydrophobic; ice retarding; wettability; microstructure	SUPERHYDROPHOBIC SURFACES; FABRICATION; BEHAVIOR; REPELLENT	The poor mechanical strength of superhydrophobic surface limits its use in civil aviation. In this work, superhydrophobic surfaces with open and closed microstructure design were prepared, and their hydrophobicity and icephobicity over icing/de-icing cycles were thoroughly studied. For all samples, contact angle decreased and contact angle hysteresis increased over time. However, surface with interconnected hollow honeycomb microstructure design kept its Cassie-Baxter state even after 20 times icing/de-icing cycles, while surface with repeated individual post microscopic unit lost its superhydrophobicity only after six times icing/de-icing cycles. The interconnected hollow honeycomb microstructure design strengthened surface mechanical strength by lowering the damage to microscopic unit. The freezing time for water droplet on surface with interconnected hollow honeycomb microstructure design was only slightly shortened over time. The difference in water/ice-solid contact area for surfaces with different nano-microscale design also led to the difference in wetting and ice-retarding ability. Surface with interconnected hollow honeycomb microstructure design showed the strongest ice-retarding ability followed by surface with interconnected hollow brick, ladder type, and triangle shape microstructure design.

All patients except emergency patients should be scheduled in advance. Regular patients arrive on time. Emergency patients arrive randomly and get non preemptive priority. So the direct waiting time of regular patients should be explicitly described. The unit direct waiting cost gradually increases with the previous waiting time. On the one hand, too many regular patients will increase the direct waiting cost for them and overtime cost for medical resources. On the other hand, too few regular patients will cause idling of medical resources and penalty for delaying regular patients' requests. So a reasonable reservation level should be determined in advance. The booking problem is modeled as a finite horizon Markov decision process. Some booking limit structures are given to improve the total expected reward. The numerical analysis shows that our policies are much better than the policy currently employed. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

J	He, W; Chen, JX; Zhang, WH				He, Wu; Chen, Jim X.; Zhang, Weihua			Low-rank representation with graph regularization for subspace clustering	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Subspace clustering; Low-rank representation; Low-dimensional subspace; Graph regularization; Matrix recovery; Matrix completion	FACE RECOGNITION; SPARSE REPRESENTATION; ALGORITHM; MATRIX; SEGMENTATION	In this paper, we propose a low-rank representation method that incorporates graph regularization for robust subspace clustering. We make the assumption that high-dimensional data can be approximated as the union of low-dimensional subspaces of unknown dimension. The proposed method extends the low-rank representation algorithm by incorporating graph regularization with a discriminative dictionary. Existing low-rank representation methods for subspace clustering use noisy data as the dictionary. The proposed technique, however, takes advantage of the discriminative dictionary to seek the lowest-rank representation by virtue of matrix recovery and completion techniques. Moreover, the discriminative dictionary is further used to construct a graph Laplacian to separate the low-rank representation of high-dimensional data. The proposed algorithm can recover the low-dimensional subspace structure from high-dimensional observations (which are often corrupted by gross errors). Simultaneously, the samples are clustered into their corresponding underlying subspaces. Extensive experimental results on benchmark databases demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for subspace clustering.

Full-length complement C8 alpha (Pv-C8 beta) and C8 beta (Pv-C8 beta) cDNA were identified in the darkbarbel catfish Pelteobagrus vachellii, and their mRNA expression levels were analyzed after ammonia-N and pathogen treatment. The Pv-C8 beta gene contained 1983 bp, including a 1794-bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding 598 amino acids. The Pv-C8 beta gene contained 1952 bp, including a 1761-bp ORF encoding 587 amino acids. Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta had the highest amino acid identity with rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss C8 alpha (62%) and Japanese flounder Paralichthys olivaceus CO (83%), respectively. Sequence analysis indicated that both Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta contained a thrombospondin type-1 (TSP1) domain, a low-density lipoprotein receptor class A (LDLR-A) domain, a membrane attack complexlperforin (MACPF) domain and an epidermal growth factor-like (EGF-like) domain. In addition, Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta were mainly distributed in the liver, head kidney, spleen, and eggs. Under ammonia-N stress, the Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta mRNA levels significantly decreased (P < 0.05), with minimum levels, respectively, attained at 24 and 48 h in the liver, 48 and 24 h in the head kidney, and 24 and 24 h in the spleen. After Aeromonas hydrophila challenge, the Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta mRNA levels significantly increased (P < 0.05), with maximum levels, respectively, attained at 48 and 24 h in the liver, 24 and 48 h in the head kidney, and 48 and 48 h in the spleen. The present study indicated that Pv-C8 alpha and Pv-C8 beta exhibited important immune responses to infection and that ammonia N in water decreased the immune responses of Pv-C8 zeta and Pv-C8 beta.

For (Ca0.8Ba1.2)(1-x) Mg (x) SiO4:0.04Eu(2+), the color changed from light-blue to deep-blue region with increasing Mg2+ content from x = 0 to x = 0.11. For (Ca0.8Ba1.2)(0.93)Mg0.07SiO4:yEu(2+), the emission band showed the opposite shift with increasing y from 1% to 8%. Interestingly, increasing Mg2+ addition led to significant reduction in the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) from 100 nm to 70 nm. Compared with Mg-free samples, the emission intensity of the Mg-containing material with x = 0.07 was enhanced by similar to 100%. The optimum doping levels of Mg2+ and Eu2+ were 0.07 and 0.02 for (Ca-0.8 Ba-1.2)(1-x) Mg (x) SiO4:0.04Eu(2+) and (Ca0.8Ba1.2)(0.93)Mg0.07SiO4:yEu(2+), respectively. These results indicate that such materials could be good candidate blue-emitting phosphors for use in solid-state lighting and displays.

Here, we present a micromagnetic study of the in-plane current-driven motion of a skyrmion in a ferromagnetic nanotrack with spatially sinusoidally varying Gilbert damping and/or non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque (STT) coefficients. It is found that the skyrmion moves in a sinusoidal pattern as a result of the spatially varying Gilbert damping and/or non-adiabatic STT in the nanotrack, which could prevent the destruction of the skyrmion caused by the skyrmion Hall effect. The results provide a guide for designing and developing the skyrmion transport channel in skyrmion-based spintronic applications.

Cell labeling is crucial as it is difficult to detect cell fate after transplantation in vivo. MSCs labeled with iron oxide nanoparticles (IONPs), which can be tracked by MRI, have tremendous potential in regenerative medicine and oncological research. As a part of nanoparticle, the iron oxide core is a key aspect that can exhibit adverse or beneficial effects on MSCs labeled for tracking. Some IONPs exhibit adverse effects, such as cytotoxicity and apoptosis, while other IONPs exhibit beneficial functions that can promote both MSC proliferation and homing efficiency. This review reveals the cytotoxic mechanisms and potential functions of the iron oxide core of IONPs in cell labeling as well as strategies for minimizing the intracellular effects of IONPs.

Study 1 is a cross-sectional correlation study exploring the relationship between the video game team-play frequency and pro-social behavior, Study 2 is a 2 (game content: violent video game and neutral video game) x 2 (game context: single-play and team-play) design with the dependent variable being cooperative behavior and Study 3 is a single factor design experiment which examines the effect of the gaming experience on cooperative behavior under a collaborative context. The main findings were that the team-play frequency had a positive correlation with pro-social behavior, and pro-social video game exposure significantly predicted pro-social behavior. Collaborative play was found to significantly increase cooperation in both violent and neutral video games. However, the level of gaming experience tended to moderate the relationship between collaborative play and the level of cooperation. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Based on our search, two experimentally observed cubic Pm (3) over barm and tetragonal P4/mmm structures are successfully reproduced under ambient pressure conditions. We confirmed the middle transition phase beta '' (orthorhombic or monoclinic) observed in experiment belongs to orthorhombic Pnma structure. By calculating the formation enthalpies under high pressure up to 100 GPa, it is found that tetragonal P4/mmm structure has potential for application under high pressure. Additionally, high-pressure phase transition is identified between cubic Pm (3) over barm structure and the orthorhombic Pnma structure at 50 GPa, above which, the orthorhombic Pnma phase is more energetically favorable. The analysis of density of states shows that all the studied NbRu structures exhibit metallic behavior and the d orbitals of both metal compositions Nb and Ru play important role.

Using the polarizability distributions about NG endohedral fullerenes (NGEFs), a new scheme based on the local polarizability of the NG is introduced to detect the shielding effects of fullerenes, using density functional theory calculations and Hirshfeld population analysis. For large cage sizes, this scheme can provide reliable results. Further analysis reveals that the shielding effect is dependent on the shape of the cage, and a shielding zone can be found around the center of the cavity in which the electric field can be considered to be uniform and of lower strength than that of an applied external field. For small cages, intermolecular interactions between the cage and the endoatom contribute to the overestimation of the shielding effects.

Special quasirandom structures are used to mimic local atomic disorders at Cu/Ag sites. A local density plus correction method is adopted to obtain correct semiconductor band gaps for all compounds. The bandgap anomaly can be seen for both sulfides and selenides, where the gap values of Ag compounds are larger than those of Cu compounds. Band gaps can be modulated from 1.63 to 1.78 eV for Cu1-xAgxGaSe2, and from 2.33 to 2.64 eV for Cu1-xAgxGaSe2. The band gap minima and maxima occur at around x = 0.5 and x = 1, respectively, for both sulfides and selenides. In order to show the transport properties of Cu1-xAgxGaX2, the effective mass is shown as a function of disordered Ag concentration. Finally, detailed band structures are shown to clarify the phonon momentum needed by the fundamental indirect-gap transitions. These results should be helpful in designing high-efficiency photovoltaic devices, with both better absorption and high mobility, by Ag-doping in CuGaX2.

In this study, 96 tissue samples from 11 valid species in three classified subgenera (Pika, Ochotona and Conothoa) from 23 locations were characterized using multilocus sequences of 7031 bp. Two mitochondria] (CYT B and COI) and five nuclear gene segments (RAG1, RAG2, TTN, OXAIL and IL1RAPL1) were sequenced. We analysed evolutionary histories using maximum likelihood (RAxML) and Bayesian analyses (BEAST), and we also used molecular species delimitation analyses (BPP) to explore species diversity. Our study supported O. syrinx (O. huangensis) as a distinct Glade from all named subgenera. Relationships among subgenera were not fully resolved, which may be due to a rapid diversification in the middle Miocene (similar to 13.90 Ma). Conflicting gene trees implied mitochondria] introgression from O. cansus to O. curzoniae. We uncovered three cryptic species from Shaanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan with strong support, suggesting an underestimation of species diversity in the "sky-island" mountains of southwest China.

The structural, elastic, and electronic properties of the five B3N4 polymorphs are investigated through the first-principles calculations. Our calculations indicate that c-B3N4 is energetically favorable in the five structures. Through the calculations of formation enthalpy, we conclude that the B3N4 polymorphs are thermodynamically stable at zero pressure except for the c(s)-B3N4. The elastic moduli of the five B3N4 polymorphs are calculated using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. The calculated bulk modulus of c(s)-B3N4 (337GPa) is the highest of them. The c-B3N4, with shear modulus of 248GPa, might be a potentially ultra incompressible and hard material. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that the c(s)-B3N4, c-B3N4, and p-B3N4 are mechanically stable within 100GPa, while the -B3N4 and -B3N4 become mechanically unstable when pressure increases to 30 and 80GPa, respectively. The calculated B/G ratios indicate that c(s)-B3N4 and p-B3N4 possess a ductile nature within 100GPa. The c-B3N4 possess a brittle nature at 0GPa, as it begins to be prone to ductility, when the pressure increases to 90GPa. The calculated band structures and densities of states show that all the five B3N4 phases are insulative. Through the quasiharmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of these B3N4 polymorphs.

Bringing more benefits to people with disabilities and combining information delivery with Internet technology to improve their quality of life is impossible if their special needs are ignored. This study employed the crowdsourcing through social media method to investigate information needs of people who are disabled. The results indicate that using the popular social media platforms WeChat and QQ can be an effective means of reaching out to this group. Information needs can be mainly divided into internal and external needs. Leisure, tourism, and entertainment as well as assistive devices are major internal information needs, whereas work, entrepreneurship, and living services are the main external information needs.

It was found that the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient could be simultaneously increased with the unique structure. Moreover, the conducting aerogels have an ultralow thermal conductivity (0.06 W m(-1) K-1) and a large Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area (228 m(2) g(-1)). The highest figure of merit (zT) value in this study was 7.56x10(-3) at room temperature upon the addition of 33.32 wt.% Ag. Although the zT value was too low, our work may provide new insights into the design and development of the thermoelectric material for applications. Further investigation with PEDOT:PSS aerogels will be continued to get an economical, lightweight, and efficient polymer thermoelectric material.

To investigate the impact of its expression on survival and clinicopathological features, we performed a meta-analysis. Comprehensive literature searches were conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Cochrane Library for relevant studies. In total, 12 studies with 997 sarcoma patients were included. CXCR4 expression was found to be significantly associated with poor overall survival (HR 2.37, 95 % CI 1.86-3.01; P < 0.001). Further, when the analysis was stratified by histological subtypes (bony sarcoma including osteosarcoma and Ewing sarcoma and soft tissue sarcoma including synovial sarcoma and rhabdomyosarcoma), statistical analysis method (multivariate analysis and univariate analysis) and CXCR4 measuring method (IHC or RT-PCR), the significant correlation to poor overall survival was also observed except for that in Ewing sarcoma and RT-PCR groups. As for clinicopathological features, CXCR4 expression was significantly associated with higher rate of metastasis (OR 6.97, 95 % CI 2.28-21.31; P = 0.001) and higher tumor stage (OR 7.55, 95 % CI 1.25-45.47; P = 0.027), but not associated with gender, age and tumor site. In conclusion, CXCR4 expression may be an effective predictive factor of poor prognosis and clinicopathological features for bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Further studies are needed to validate our findings.

The doping of Sm3+ has no obvious influence on the crystal structure of the Ca3Bi(PO4)(3) powders and all the samples possess a cubic symmetry. Under the 401 nm excitation, the sample exhibits three typical emission bands located at 561, 598, and 644 nm corresponding to (4)G(5/2) -> H-6(5/2), H-6(7/2), and H-6(9/2) transitions, respectively. For x = 0.03, the sample exhibits an optimum luminescence. The type of energy transfer between Sm3+ is considered as dipole-dipole interaction according to Dexter's theory. The CIE chromaticity coordinates indicate that the emission of Ca3Bi0.97(PO4)(3):0.03Sm(3+) locates in orange region. The results indicate that the phosphor may be used as an orange phosphor for NUV-based white LEDs.

When the system becomes empty, the server stays idle until the number of waiting customers reaches N or the sum of the service times of the waiting customers in the system reaches or exceeds a predetermined positive integer D, whichever happens first (referred to as Min(N, D)-policy). Employing the renewal theory, the total probability decomposition law and the probability generating function technique we obtain the probability generating function for the transient queue size distribution at time epoch . Also, the explicit recursive formulas of the steady-state queue length distribution at time epochs , n, and outside observer's time epoch are derived, respectively.

Here we study the influence of the edge effect on the current-induced generation of a magnetic skyrmion in a finite-length thin-film ferromagnetic nanotrack with interface-induced Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. It shows that a stable skyrmion or a bunch of skyrmions can be successfully generated as long as the distance between the current injection region and the nanotrack terminal is larger than a certain threshold. We investigate the failed skyrmion generation caused by the edge effect, which will lead to an error writing event. We also present the phase diagrams of the skyrmion generation obtained for different material and geometric parameters. Our results could be useful for designing skyrmion-based information storage devices. (C) 2017 Author(s).

The influence of ZnO and Cu layer thickness on optical and electrical properties of multilayer structure was investigated. The X-ray diffraction, Field Emission Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy were used to explore the crystal structure, surface morphology, respectively. The Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 double-beam spectrophotometer and 4-point Probes Resistivity Measurement System (RTS-9) were used to investigate the optical and electrical properties. The experiment and FDTD (finite-difference time-domain) simulation results indicated that the optical transmittance increased with increase of ZnO thickness in ranging from 20 to 60 nm at fixed thickness (10 nm) of Cu layer. The RTS-9 testing showed that the sheet resistance decreased from 30 to 6.5 Omega/sq with increase of Cu layer from 6 to 20 nm. However, the sheet resistance slightly changed with increase of ZnO thickness. The Haacke's figure of merit (FOM) for all samples with various Cu thicknesses was also calculated. The highest value of FOM was 2.95 x 10(-3) (Omega(-1)) in visible region (400-800 nm) when ZnO thickness was 60 nm and Cu thickness was 8 nm. In addition, the aging effect of FOM (stability) was also investigated with the changing of time in nature environment.

Many general evolution trends are concluded for the six structures, including the lattice parameters (a, c), elastic constants (c(ij)) and the degree of the isotropy (A, A(1), A(2)), and the axial shrinkage tendency. The (Ti0.5V0.5)(2)GeC behaves the largest compressive anisotropy in (c/a)/(c(0)/a(0)) but (Ti0.5V0.5)(5)GeC4 behaves opposite compressive anisotropy which shows a value below 1 between 0 and 40 GPa, whereas (Ti0.5V0.5)(4)GeC3 exists a softening behavior between 20 and 40 GPa. The lowest volume contraction of (Ti0.5V0.5)(4)GeC3 is confirmed by the density of states, together with the observation of its minimum c(12) and c(13) among the same type of compounds. The density of states analysis observed the smaller contribution of Ti at Fermi level with respect to that of V. A common phenomenon is observed from the six structures, namely, for any considered heavy atoms including Ti or V, once the heavy atom is surrounded by one C layer and one Ge layer, its density of states contribution at Fermi level is larger than that of atom surrounded by two C layers originating mainly from the electronegativity difference of C and Ge. The bond length of C/Ge-Ti is always slightly longer than that of C/Ge-V except for (Ti0.5V0.5)(2)GeC which shows totally equivalent length. A smaller shear modulus of (Ti0.5V0.5)(2)GeC is observed relative to its two end members. The electron density difference analysis reveals the diverse charge transfer directions and bonding features in these compounds. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Then, taking the NPP of the potential vegetation in average climate conditions during 1986-2005 as the basis for evaluation, this study examined whether the potential vegetation adapts to climate change or not. Meanwhile, the degree of inadaptability was evaluated. Finally, the NPP vulnerability of the potential vegetation was evaluated by synthesizing the frequency and degrees of inadaptability to climate change. In the past 55 years, the NPP of desert ecosystems in the south of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the north of China and in western Tibetan Plateau was prone to the effect of climate change. The NPP of most forest ecosystems was not prone to the influence of climate change. The low NPP vulnerability to climate change of the evergreen broad-leaved and coniferous forests was observed. Furthermore, the NPP of the desert ecosystems in the north of the Tianshan Mountains and grassland ecosystems in the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau also had low vulnerability to climate change. In the next 35 years, the NPP vulnerability to climate change would reduce the forest-steppe in the Songliao Plain, the deciduous broad-leaved forests in the warm temperate zone, and the alpine steppe in the central and western Tibetan Plateau. The NPP vulnerability would significantly increase of the temperate desert in the Junggar Basin and the alpine desert in the Kunlun Mountains. The NPP vulnerability of the subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forests would also increase. The area of the regions with increased vulnerability would account for 27.5% of China.

Their crystal structure, and photophysical, electrochemical and liquid crystal characteristics were investigated. The X-ray structure of Pt-L-12 shows a severe distortion of this complex towards a tetrahedral geometry. All complexes are emissive both in degassed solution and in the solid state at room temperature with emission maxima in the red region of the spectrum. Pt-L-16 and Pt-L-12 show monotropic smectic liquid crystal characteristics. Moreover, these liquid crystal complexes can be aligned on a rubbed nylon-6 glass substrate and produce polarized emission with a dichroic ratio of 5.1.

We have synthesized two series of discotic mesogenic materials derived from hexasubstituted triphenylene, including (i) 1-aryl-2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(pentyloxy) triphenylenes (14 new compounds) by a Suzuki cross-coupling reaction between the appropriate 1-bromotriphenylene precursor and various arylboronic acids and (ii) unsymmetrical facial dibenzo[fg, op] tetracene discotic molecules (11 new compounds) by an FeCl3-oxidized cyclodehydrogenation reaction of the former. The mesomorphism has been investigated by polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning microscopy, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Most aryl-substituted triphenylene derivatives exhibit a single hexagonal columnar mesophase, enantiotropic over small temperature ranges or monotropic, with this low stability being likely attributed to the free-rotating bulky side-on arene group that disrupts a perfect stacking. The corresponding more rigid and flat dibenzo[fg, op] tetracene derivatives also self-organize into a hexagonal columnar mesophase, but with a larger mesophase stability than their parents, and occurring slightly above room temperature. The UV/vis absorption and fluorescence emission spectra have been measured. Tetracenes show stronger photoluminescence than aryltriphenylene in solution, while the reversed is observed in thin films, where a strong excimer emission for one of the polar 1-aryltriphenylenes is observed. The charge carrier mobility of two representative discogens has been measured by the time-offlight photocurrent technique. The results show that the discogen with a lateral nucleus dipole displays a hole mobility of 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in the mesophase, while the non-polar compound exhibits a hole mobility of 10(-2) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in its metastable-induced ordered phase. The charge carrier mobility is discussed as a function of the supramolecular organization.

In the paper, both the crystal-field (CF) mechanism and the charge-transfer (CT) mechanism (double-mechanism model) are considered to calculate the spin Hamiltonian parameters. The calculated results are in agreement with the experimental data. Moreover, the calculated results show that the CT mechanism cannot be omitted for a high-valence state V4+ ions in KZnClSO4 center dot 3H(2)O single crystals.

Our results indicated that the density of states (DOS) was dominated predominantly by Fe-3d states at Fermi levels, and stronger hybridization exists between As-1 and As-1 atoms. Three hole pockets are formed at Gamma and Z points, and two electronic pockets are formed at A and E points. The Dirac cone-like bands appear near B and D points. For the first time we calculated the elastic properties and found that CaFeAs2 is a mechanically stable and moderately hard material, it has elastic anisotropy and brittleness, which agrees well with the bonding picture and the calculation of Debye temperature (Theta(D)).

Dynamic micromagnetic simulation of the magnetic spectrum of permalloy nanodot array with vortex state	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Ferroresonance; Permalloy; Nanodot arrays	FERROMAGNETIC-RESONANCE; MODES; DOTS	Due to its potential applications in high-density magnetic storage and spin electronic devices, the ferromagnetic resonance absorption phenomenon has recently drawn much attention. By studying the influence of different materials with various shapes on this phenomenon, the new understandings gained could lead to other applications in the future. In this paper, dynamic magnetic susceptibilities of the vortex state in permalloy nanodot arrays have been investigated using a three-dimensional object oriented micromagnetic framework (OOMMF) code with a two-dimensional periodic boundary condition (2D-PBC) extension and compared with those of a single dot carefully. The resonance mode is excited in the vortex state of nanodot arrays by the microwave magnetic field perpendicular to the dot plane. In this case only radially symmetric spin wave modes can be excited. The influence of the geometric parameters on the resonance frequency has been studied systemically, including the dot radius, the number of repeating elements, and the dot distance. One can see that the resonance peak of the dot array is higher than that of a single dot because of the induced stronger magnetostatic coupling. A critical dot distance exists at which the dot array may be treated as a single dot. There is only one resonance peak for both the dot array and the single dot, as the radius changes.

Here, we describe a new pit viper species, Gloydius rubromaculatus sp. n. Shi, Li and Liu, 2017 that was discovered in this region, with a brief taxonomic revision of the genus Gloydius. The new species can be distinguished from the other congeneric species by the following characteristics: cardinal crossbands on the back, indistinct canthus rostralis, glossy dorsal scales, colubrid-like oval head shape, irregular small black spots on the head scales, black eyes and high altitude distribution (3300-4770 m above sea level). The mitochondrial phylogenetic reconstruction supported the validity of the new species and furthermore reaffirms that G. intermedius changdaoensis, G. halys cognatus, G. h. caraganus and G. h. stejnegeri should be elevated as full species. Gloydius rubromaculatus sp. n. was found to be insectivorous: preying on moths (Lepidoptera, Noctuidae, Sideridis sp.) in the wild. This unusual diet may be one of the key factors to the survival of this species in such a harsh alpine environment.

LST was retrieved by the atmospheric correction algorithms. Based on the correlation coefficients, stepwise regression analysis was developed to examine how multiple factors variability led to LST variations. The differences in LST between impact factors vary depending on time in a day. The elevation and land use types significantly affect the LST in sunny slope or shadow areas has a significantly quadratic curve correlation or a negative linear correlation with it, the influence of slope and aspect is not very significant. LST for forestland, grassland and bare land in the sunny slope and shadow area was the cubic polynomial related to its elevation. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and normalized difference moisture index (NDMI) effectively express LST in mountainous. LST and NDMI or NDVI have a significantly negative correlation, NDMI is more effective and more applicable for the expression of LST.

The taxonomic status and species composition of the three groups remain controversial due to conflicting phenotypic analyses and insufficient phylogenetic reconstruction; likewise, the position of the monotypic Borneophrys remains uncertain with respect to the horned toads. Further, the diversity of the horned toads remains poorly understood, especially for widespread species. Herein, we evaluate species-level diversity based on 45 of the 57 described species from throughout southern China, Southeast Asia and the Himalayas using Bayesian inference trees and the Generalized Mixed Yule Coalescent (GMYC) approach. We estimate the phylogeny using both mitochondrial and nuclear DNA data. Analyses reveal statistically significant mito-nuclear discordance. All analyses resolve paraphyly for horned toads involving multiple strongly supported clades. These clades correspond with geography. We resurrect the genera Atympanophrys and Xenophrys from the synonymy of Megophrys to eliminate paraphyly of Megophrys s.l. and to account for the morphological, molecular and biogeographic differences among these groups, but we also provide an alternative option. Our study suggests that Borneophrys is junior synonym of Megophrys sensu stricto. We provide an estimation of timeframe for the horned toads. The mitochondrial and nuclear trees indicate the presence of many putative undescribed species. Widespread species, such as Xenophrys major and X. minor, likely have dramatically underestimated diversity. The integration of morphological and molecular evidence can validate this discovery. Montane forest dynamics appear to play a significant role in driving diversification of horned toads. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The influence of pH, temperature, coexisting organics and initial concentration on the adsorption capacity of HA-M for CBs were investigated to obtain the optimum removal efficiency. Furthermore, the adsorption kinetics and isotherms were researched as well as the column adsorption studies to reveal the mechanism for HA-M to adsorb CBs. The experimental results indicated that the HA-M materials exhibit high removal efficiency of CBs (>90%) in a wide range of pH values and temperatures. The adsorption of CBs with HA-M was realized by the hydrophobic interactions between CBs and HA-M. In addition, the HA-M also performed high removal efficiency toward organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in aqueous solutions. Most important, the excellent adsorbability of the super-hydrophobic HA-M adsorbent could be comparable or fairly good compared with other adsorbents. Consequently, our present investigations provided a facile synthesis route for the highly effective and recyclable hydrophobic adsorbent for the adsorptive removal of CBs and OCPs from aqueous solutions.

Due to disturbing and interacting of the fractional Laplacian operator on a bounded interval with white noise, the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation is too complicated to be understood. This paper would explore and analyze this stochastic fractional system. Using a suitable weighted space with some fractional operator skills, it overcame the difficulties coming from the fractional Laplacian operator on a bounded interval. Applying the tightness instead of the common compactness, and combining Prokhorov theorem with Skorokhod embedding theorem, it solved the convergence problem in the case of white noise. It finally established the existence of martingale solutions for the stochastic fractional nonlinear Schrodinger equation on a bounded interval.

From the viewpoint of the weighted function, in this paper, the existing least mean square (LMS)-based adaptive algorithms with error nonlinearities are divided into three types, i.e., V-shaped, A-shaped, and M-shaped algorithms. Then, to obtain the merits of the V-shaped and A-shaped algorithms, a new family of robust M-shaped error weighted LMS algorithms is proposed. Their steady-state mean square deviation (MSD) analyses are made, which reveal the learning abilities of error nonlinearities: 1) for the V-shaped algorithm, it can achieve smaller steady state MSD for sub-Gaussian noise than that for super-Gaussian noise; 2) the A-shaped algorithm can be used more effectively for super-Gaussian noise than that for sub-Gaussian noise; and 3) the M-shaped algorithm combines the characteristics of the V-shaped and A-shaped algorithms. Furthermore, based on the proposed robust M-shaped function, a proportionate normalized robust M-shaped algorithm is presented for echo cancellation application. Finally, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical results and to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms in different environments.

So it indicates that tourism economy development and environmental protection should coexist, which is the base for measuring decarbonated development in the system of tourist attractions (DDSTA). Due to the complicated system of a tourist attraction, it not only contains connection between tourist activities and tourism resources, but also includes the relationships between human activity and ecological economy as well as the interaction of various factors in tourist attractions. This paper concentrates on how to measure decarbonated development of tourist attractions using the organic combination of qualitative and quantitative approach, proposing (MDL)-D-2 measurement mode associated with management entropy, measuring indicator reference set and application set for DDSTA and taking Jiuzhai Valley as a case study to apply management-entropy-based measurement system for DDSTA and extend previous research on low-carbon tourist attraction and tourism.

Positions of bromo or nitro groups in target compounds were unambiguously established by combined analysis of 2D nuclear magnetic resonance experiments including nuclear Overhauser effect and heteronuclear multiple-bond correlation which indicated that monobromination or mononitration occurred preferentially at position 8 or 5 of 1a, respectively. Calculations of molecular geometry on 2a-e reveal that the -Br or -NO2 group(s) would induce different degrees of helical deformation in the triphenylene core and the degree of non-planarity decrease in the following order: 2c > 2b > 2e > 2a > 2d. In contrast to highly twisted 2b-c and 2e, which did not form a mesophase, the formation of a hexagonal columnar phase at room temperature even down to -50 degrees C was observed and confirmed by polarising optical microscopy and X-ray diffraction for sterically less hindered, monosubstituted 2a and 2d.

All the prepared esters in two series were observed to form a single hexagonal columnar phase, except for Tp4-1 having four -butyloxy and two adjacent -methoxycarbonyl chains which displays two columnar mesophase behaviours with a transition from the columnar plastic phase to hexagonal columnar phase. A significant difference between the two mesophase was observed in the variable temperature X-ray diffraction studies, and the mesophase assignment was also confirmed by polarising optical microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. Moreover, the prepared esters in each series display the general trend of decreasing clearing temperature upon increasing alkoxy or alkoxycarbonyl chains length. The intermediate triphenylene 2,3-dicarboxylic acids were also found not only to exhibit columnar hexagonal mesophase over a narrower temperature range by maintaining high melting and clearing points but also to form organogel on mixing with toluene or dichloromethane with the assistance of hydrogen bonding.

In this study, we employed a new sustainable microorganism-route to synthesize the fibroid fungus that could be used as the precursor to prepare sulfur host materials for lithium sulfur batteries. The H3PO4-activated fibroid fungus presents a controllable nano- and micro-structure after high temperature carbonization, which can effectively suppress polysulfides dissolution and supply space for sulfur accommodation due to its high specific surface area of 509 m(2) g(-1) and pore volume of 0.69 m(3) g(-1). As a result, the assembled lithium sulfur (Li-S) battery shows a high initial specific discharge capacity of 1319 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C and maintains a capacity of 663 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles, corresponding to the outstanding reaction kinetics and cycling stability. Our results display an eco-friendly, renewable and controlled synthesis process of porous carbon, which features a promising application in preparing versatile electrodes in energy storage.

The reaction of Zn-CNTs and O-2 in aqueous solution was performed for the in situ generation of H2O2, which was employed to react with Fe2+ for the Fenton degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The effect of various parameters, including the initial pH, dosage of Zn-CNTs and Fe2+ concentration on 4-CP degradation was examined. The removal efficiencies of 4-CP and TOC (total organic carbon) were 98.8% and 87.4%, respectively, when the Fe2+ concentration was 20 mg L-1, initial pH was 2.0, Zn-CNT dosage was 2 g L-1, reaction time was 20 min and O2 flow rate was 400 mL min(-1). When 4-CP was spiked in the secondary effluent of a municipal wastewater treatment plant, the removal efficiency of 4-CP and TOC was 47.0% and 45.6%, respectively, under the above-mentioned conditions. The intermediate products were detected by LC-MS and IC, and the possible degradation pathway of 4-CP and the reaction mechanism of the Zn-CNTs/O-2/Fe2+ system were tentatively proposed.

The new species, Kurixalus lenquanensis sp. n., is distinguished from other congeneric species by a combination of (1) smaller body size (SVL in males ranges from 25.0 to 28.9 mm), (2) obtusely pointed snout with no prominence on tip, (3) rough and brown dorsum with darker mark, (4) absence of large dark spots on ventral surface, (5) brownish clouded chin, (6) granular throat, chest, and belly, (7) presence of vomerine teeth, (8) serrated dermal fringes along outer edge of limbs, (9) slight nuptial pad, (10) golden brown iris, and (11) single internal vocal sac. The new species is known only from montane scrub vegetation at the type locality (Lenquan Village, Mengzi City, Yunnan Province) and Yangjiatian Village, Gejiu City, Yunnan Province. Genetically, the new species is nested within a clade of Taiwanese Kurixalus and recovered as the sister taxon to Kurixalus idiootocus with strong support values, indicating that the ancestor of this new species might have come from Taiwan Island or the ancestor of this new species may have been widespread in southern China and the descendent species in between Taiwan and Yunnan has become extinct.

Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized from AgNO3 using rice straw biomass as the reducing agent at room temperature via light irradiation. Full wavelength scanning with UV/Vis spectrophotometer was used to study the effect of light intensity, reaction time, and concentrations of rice straw biomass and AgNO3 during AgNPs synthesis. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) showed that the peak wavelength of synthesized silver nanoparticles arose at 425 nm, the optimal light intensity observed was 60,000 lx, and the optimal reaction time was 140 min. The optimum concentrations of the rice straw biomass and AgNO3 used were 4 mg/mL and 2 mM, respectively. The AgNPs were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis. The zeta potential of AgNPs reached -21.2 mV. In addition, the AgNPs synthesized by rice straw biomass revealed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Bacillus subtilis, and Staphyloccus aureus. The inhibition rate reached about 97.17 +/- 2.01% when the concentration of AgNPs solution used was 8 mu g/mL. In the detection of antimicrobial effect of AgNPs and antibiotics, the antibacterial activity was found to be superior to that of antibiotics alone.

Two series of compounds exhibited a typical nematic liquid crystal texture, and the 5-halogen-1,4-substituted-1,2,3-triazole series 4 had a wider mesomorphic temperature range than the corresponding series 3 due to the effect of the halogen atom substituent on the triazole. These compounds showed similar absorption spectra, but the fluorescence emission spectra of 4 were obviously redshift relative to 3. Cyclic voltammetry investigations revealed that the redox-active ferrocenyl groups of 3 and 4 follow one-electron transfer processes. [GRAPHICS] .

In this paper, we utilize Hamacher operations to develop some hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy aggregation operators: hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher weighted average (HPFHWA) operator, hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric (HPFHWG) operator, hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average (HPFHOWA) operator, hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted geometric (HPFHOWG) operator, hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher hybrid average(HPFHHA) operator and hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Hamacher hybrid geometric (HPFHHG) operator. The prominent characteristic of these proposed operators are studied. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems. Finally, a practical example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

It is mainly distributed in the southwest of Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, and is the primary edible bamboo of giant panda. Bamboo plants have both ornamental value and economic value, and the study on the genetic diversity of arrow bamboo at DNA level is of great significance. This paper mainly uses AFLP molecular marker technique as research method, selects two populations for the research, and uses POPGENE3.2 software to analyze experimental data. The results indicate that arrow bamboo has high degree of genetic diversity, and the variation rate of population is very low. This paper offers the basic materials for the theoretical research on the ecological adaptation and distribution characteristics of arrow bamboo, and provides references for the research and protection of bamboo plants in the future.

The obtained ground state structure and mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with the available experimental and theoretical data. A full elastic tensor and crystal anisotropy of Be3N2 in two phases are determined in the wide pressure range. Results indicated that the two phases of Be3N2 are mechanically stable and strongly pressure dependent in the range of pressure from 0 to 80 GPa. The superior mechanical properties show that the two phases of Be3N2 are potential candidate structures to be the hard material. And the alpha-Be3N2 has better mechanical properties than beta-Be3N2. By the calculated B/G ratio, it is predicted that both phases are intrinsically brittleness and strongly prone to ductility when the pressure is above 65.6 and 68.5 GPa, respectively. Additionally, the pressure-induced elastic anisotropy analysis indicates that the elastically anisotropic of Be3N2 in both phases is strengthening with increasing pressure, and strongly dependent on the propagation direction.

However, during the theranostic applications, the accumulation efficiency of CNPs in target organs is unknown yet, which largely hinders the extension of CNPs into clinical uses. Herein, we prepared skeleton-labeled C-13-CNPs that had identical properties to commercial CNPs suspension injection (CNSI) for the imaging and quantification in TDLN. C-13-CNPs were prepared by arc discharge method, followed by homogenization with polyvinylpyrrolidone. The size distribution and morphology of C-13-CNPs were nearly the same as those of CNSI under transmission electron microscope. The hydrodynamic radii of both C-13-CNPs and CNSI were similar, too. According to X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and infrared spectroscopy analyses, the chemical compositions and chemical states of elements were also nearly identical for both labeled and commercial forms. The skeleton labeling of C-13 was reflected by the shift of G-band toward lower frequency in Raman spectra. C-13-CNPs showed competitive performance in TDLN imaging, where the three lymph nodes (popliteal lymph node, common iliac artery lymph node, and paraaortic lymph node) were stained black upon the injection into the hind extremity of mice. The direct quantification of C-13-CNPs indicated that 877 mu g/g of C-13-CNPs accumulated in the first station of TDLN (popliteal lymph node). The second station of TDLN (common iliac artery lymph node) had even higher accumulation level (1,062 mu g/g), suggesting that C-13-CNPs migrated efficiently along lymphatic vessel. The value decreased to 405 mu g/g in the third station of TDLN (paraaortic lymph node). Therefore, the (13)CCNPs provided quantitative approach to image and quantify CNSI in biological systems. The implication in biomedical applications and biosafety evaluations of CNSI is discussed.

It is shown that the correlation of intensity fluctuation (CIF) of the scattered field is closely related to the characteristic of the collection of particles. An example of light waves on scattering from a collection of particles with Gaussian-centered distribution has been discussed, and the influence of the distribution characteristic on the normalized correlation coefficient of CIF of the scattered field has been studied.

For the sandwich sexfoil nanoparticle, the calculated extinction spectrum shows that with the thickness of the dielectric layer increasing, long-wavelength peaks blueshift, while short-wavelength peaks redshift. Strong near-field coupling of the upper and lower metal layers leads to electric and magnetic field resonances; as the thickness increases, the electric field resonance gradually increases, while the magnetic field resonance decreases. The obtained refractive index sensitivity and figure of merit are 332 nm/RIU and 3.91 RIU-1, respectively. In order to obtain better sensing ability, we further research the LSPR character of monolayer Ag sexfoil nanoparticle. After a series of trials to optimize the thickness and shape, the refractive index sensitivity approximates 668 nm/RIU, and the greatest figure of merit value comes to 14.8 RIU-1.

The observed drift carrier mobility of hole is 0.07cm(2) V-1 s(-1) in the lower temperature smectic mesophase by time-of-flight technique. We used FPh-BTBT-C12 solutions (e.g. 0.1 wt% in p-xylene) for forming an organic semiconductor layer by solution casting, and fabricated top-contact/bottom-gate type filed effect transistor devices and its mobility was determined 0.42cm(2) V-1 s(-1) at room temperature.

Lam	BIOMED RESEARCH INTERNATIONAL			English	Article							SWEET-POTATO; ARABIDOPSIS-THALIANA; HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE; MESSENGER-RNA; EXPRESSION; PLANTS; TOLERANCE; FAMILY; DROUGHT; H2O2	As an indicator of the antioxidant capability of plants, catalase can detoxify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by environmental stresses. Sweet potato is one of the top six most important crops in the world. However, its catalases remain largely unknown. In this study, a catalase encoding gene, IbCAT2 (accession number: KY615708), was identified and cloned from sweet potato cv. Xushu 18. It contained a 1479 nucleotides' open reading frame (ORF). S-R-L, Q-K-L, and a putative calmodulin binding domain were located at the C-terminus of IbCAT2, which suggests that IbCAT2 could be a peroxisomal catalase. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) based quantitative analyses showed that IbCAT2 was mainly expressed in young leaves and expanding tuberous roots under normal conditions. When exposed to 10% PEG6000 or 200mmol/L NaCl solutions, IbCAT2 was upregulated rapidly in the first 11 days and then downregulated, although different tissues showed different degree of change. Overexpression of IbCAT2 conferred salt and drought tolerance in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The positive response of IbCAT2 to abiotic stresses suggested that IbCAT2 might play an important role in stress responses.

As a 3D binder-free electrode for nonenzymatic glucose sensing, CuCo2O4 NWAs/CC shows high sensing performance towards glucose under alkaline conditions, with a wide detection range from 1 mu M to 0.93 mM, a low detection limit of 0.5 mu M (S/N = 3), and a high detection sensitivity of 3.93 mA mM(-1) cm(-2). Moreover, CuCo2O4 NWAs/CC shows good selectivity in the presence of common interferents and good reproducibility for glucose detection, which make it a promising electrode material for sensitive determination of glucose in human samples.

It then uses those conditions to investigate the relationships among linear dependence of vectors, linear independence of vectors and the bideterminant of a matrix. It finally shows that the generalized Cramer's rule is valid for solving the system of linear equations.

In this study, we utilised Fargesia rufa Yi, a species important to forest carbon sequestration and endangered giant pandas, to evaluate physiological, biochemical and ultrastructural responses to drought, salinity and their combination. Under drought alone, F. rufa exhibited reduced water loss from leaves, photochemistry inhibition, pigment degradation, reactive oxygen species accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and damage to organelles compared with salinity and combined stress treatments. The superior performance under drought alone was attributed to greater thermal dissipation and the water-water cycle capacities, increased SOD/AsA-GSH cycle enzymes activities, and a favourable redox balance of antioxidants. Therefore, relative to salinity alone and drought+salinity, F. rufa plants under drought exhibit highly efficient mechanisms to protect against oxidative damage, which most likely allow accelerated recovery of photosynthetic plasticity once the stress is removed.

With the increase in the concentration of complex, the viscosity of DNA decreased, and the binding mode is more detailed: there is partially intercalate binding. Furthermore, besides the intercalate binding, the existence of groove binding was confirmed through the ionic strength experiment in Scatchard analysis. Thermodynamic studies provided some thermodynamic parameters: Delta(r)Hm(Theta) = 1.43 x 10(5) J mol(-1), Delta Sm-r(Theta) = 576.14 J mol(-1), Delta Sm-r(Theta) (303K) = -3.16 x 10(4) J mol(-1), they illustrated that the binding mechanism between HE-Zn(II) complex and hsDNA was driven mainly by entropy.

The results showed that the hybrids are semiconductor molecules, which have a certain absorption in the visible region. The hole or electron transport capability of a non-peripherally substituted octamethyl phthalocyanine molecule is obviously better than that of phthalocyanine or non-peripherally substituted octafluorine, octamethoxy phthalocyanine molecules at 300K, whereas the holes or electron transport capabilities of four non-peripherally substituted octamethoxy phthalocyanine-tetrabenzoporphyrin hybrids are basically the same. Overall, the hole transport capability of hybrids is superior to their electron transport capability. The charge transfer rate constant and the carrier mobility rate of three representative molecules using three methods, that is the long range-corrected functionals CHB-B3LYP and WB97XD, the metahybrid GGA M06-2X functional, are consistent with the use of the density functional B3LYP method.

In order to provide some original examples, we examine the transfer of the DG-property to pullbacks.

Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is a major intracellular protein phosphatase that plays crucial roles in hormone signal transduction and abiotic stress response. Characterization of PP2A can elucidate the mechanisms of stress resistance in this crop. In this study, a total of 15 PP2A transcripts, including nine regulatory subunit- encoding sequences and six catalytic subunit- encoding sequences, were identified from sweet potato and found to be expressed at varying levels. Only one contained a complete open reading frame and encoded a B regulatory subunit (termed IbPP2A1). Ten polymorphic sites were distributed in the coding region of this gene, but most did not result in amino acid change. RNA sequencing- based digital gene expression profiling showed that this PP2A gene was primarily expressed in fibrous roots and developing tuberous roots under natural conditions. After drought, salinity, and alkaline stress treatment, the expression of IbPP2A1 was obviously upregulated in stems and tuberous roots at 2 days, whereas the expression of IbPP2A1 in leaves was only upregulated by drought stress at 2 days. However, heterogeneous expression of IbPP2A1 did not enhance abiotic stress tolerance in recombinant Saccharomyces cerevisiae.

Diffusion studies reveal that energy barriers exist for these radicals to approach or exit these water cages. Energy decomposition analyses further reveal that coulombic repulsion between the radical and water cage is responsible for these energy barriers and the inability of these species to react with cage water molecules. This study provides insight into mechanisms for the storage of free radicals, which is normally extremely difficult because of their high reactivities toward many substances.

This paper is devoted to the discussion of fuzzy soft set based approximate reasoning. First, based on fuzzy implication operators, the notion of fuzzy soft implication relation between fuzzy soft sets is introduced. The composition method of fuzzy soft implication relations is provided. Second, Triple I methods for fuzzy soft modus ponens (FSMP)and fuzzy soft modus tollens (FSMT) are investigated. Computational formulas for FSMP and FSMT with respect to left-continuous t-norms and its residual implication are presented. At last, the reversibility properties of Triple I methods are analyzed.

All the arriving customers require the first essential service, whereas some of them may opt for a second service from the J additional services with some probability. As soon as the system becomes empty, the server will not restart the service until the sum of the service times of the waiting customers in the system reaches or exceeds some given positive integer D. Applying the total probability decomposition law, renewal theory, and probability generating function technique, the queueing indices and reliability measures are investigated simultaneously in our work. Both the probability generating function of the transient queue length distribution and the explicit formulas of the steady-state queue length distribution at time epoch n(+) are derived. Meanwhile, the stochastic decomposition property is presented for the proposed model. Various reliability indices, including the transient and steady-state unavailability, the expected number of breakdowns during (0(+), n(+)], and the equilibrium failure frequency, are discussed. Finally, the optimum value of D for minimizing the system cost is numerically discussed under a given cost structure.

A novel catalyst precursor ferrous tartrate (C4H4O6Fe) obtained by one-step chemical synthesis is investigated in this study. The influence of reaction temperature on the morphology of the precursor's decomposition products under H-2 is analyzed while Fe particles with a macroporous structure are obtained. HCNTs with a coil diameter and coil pitch of about 0.26 mu m and 0.28 mu m are achieved using C4H4O6Fe as catalyst precursor at 550 degrees C. Interestingly, Fe particles with different crystal faces were observed. In addition, electrochemical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) utilizing HCNTs obtained at 550 degrees C as electrode materials are assembled exhibiting an enhanced specific capacitance of 95 F g(-1) after acid treatment at 0.1 A g(-1) in Na2SO4.

It was found that the E/M field significantly influences the structure and reorientation dynamics of DMSO-H2O interactions. As the strength of E/M field increasing, the polarization and average hydrogen-bond number of water-water increase after a threshold of E/M field strength. But the static dielectric constant shows different trend after a threshold of E/M field strength. An empirical formula was proposed, predicting E/M field strength depending on the dielectric constant of DMSO aqueous solution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

To reduce the impact of impulsive noise, the noise-free error signal is estimated by using the robust shrinkage method. It uses two threshold parameters as compared to that in the conventional shrinkage method.

This study reviews the implementation of school football policies for the purpose of facilitating development of school football. By combining methodologies such as a literature review, interview survey, and questionnaires with theories of public policy implementation, an analysis framework was set up under which deviations from the school football policies during the implementation process were analyzed comprehensively. It was found that symbolic, selective, and additional implementation and collusions are common when the policies are implemented. Action is needed to strengthen policy promotion and precisely define the goals. Improved mechanisms are needed to manage the policy implementers, differentiating functions of school football. More resources are needed to facilitate policy implementation, which should be allocated in a reasonable manner. Enhanced supervision and appraisal of school football policies is needed, and accountability for their implementation must be clarified.

First-principles investigation of mechanical and electronic properties of MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na)	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							ELASTIC PROPERTIES; SUPERCONDUCTIVITY; PEROVSKITE	Mechanical and electronic properties of Cu2Sb-type compounds MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) have been studied by the first-principles calculations. The main trends in structure parameters, mechanical parameters, electronic bands, and densities of states (DOS) for MFeAs are analyzed according to the variable cation M sites. Our results show that the lattice constants increase, while the bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus decrease with the increasing radii of M sites in the sequence CuFeAs -> LiFeAs -> NaFeAs. Mulliken overlap population indicates that different M atoms in MFeAs (M = Cu, Li, and Na) would influence the bond nature of Fe-As, which may induce the superconductivity. The disappearance of the hole-pockets affects the superconductivity in CuFeAs. Although the value of the DOSs N(E-F) at the Fermi level grows with decreasing radii of M sites, it is not the only factor influencing the superconductivity. Due to the repulsive interaction between Cu-3d and Fe-3d states in CuFeAs phase, it would change the position of Fe-3d orbits and Fermi energy level after introducing Cu in this structure. Therefore, after introducing Cu in the structure would induce the different position of Fe-3d states and Fermi energy level. Therefore, we believe that the component M has an important influence on the superconductivity. Published by AIP Publishing.	[Chen, Z. J.; Xu, G. B.; Yan, J.

The distinct differences in cationic radius lead to a special morphology, which is attributed to the symmetry of the crystal structure and the differences in the growth rates of various crystals, and it further leads to the variation of luminescence. It was found that the charge transfer band of MWO4:0.04Eu(3+) exhibits a blue shift with an increasing cationic radius, and the shift is ascribed to less covalency being caused by an increase in the cationic radius. The emission intensity obviously increases with cationic radius, increasing for the samples with a monoclinic phase; however, it is the opposite for the samples with a tetragonal phase, and CaWO4:0.04Eu(3+) exhibits an optimal emission intensity. In addition, the possible reasons for the decay lifetime are also discussed in detail. Our results indicate that cations can effectively control the crystal structure, micromorphology, and luminescence in tungstate phosphors, and thus, our approach is effective for obtaining materials with the desired morphology and crystal structure.

The current study aims to explore the potential mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts between negative life events and antenatal depression. Methods Data were collected in June 2012 and October 2012. 495 rural pregnant women were interviewed. Depressive symptoms were measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale, stresses of pregnancy were measured by the pregnancy pressure scale, negative automatic thoughts were measured by the automatic thoughts questionnaire, and negative life events were measured by the life events scale for pregnant women. We used logistic regression and path analysis to test the mediating effect. Results The prevalence of antenatal depression was 13.7%. In the logistic regression, the only socio-demographic and health behavior factor significantly related to antenatal depression was sleep quality. Negative life events were not associated with depression in the fully adjusted model. Path analysis showed that the eventual direct and general effects of negative automatic thoughts were 0.39 and 0.51, which were larger than the effects of negative life events. Conclusions This study suggested that there was a potentially significant mediating effect of negative automatic thoughts. Pregnant women who had lower scores of negative automatic thoughts were more likely to suffer less from negative life events which might lead to antenatal depression.

The as-prepared aluminum-humic acid-lanthanum (Al-HA-La) aerogel composites were fully characterized by nitrogen adsorption-desorption, SEM, EDX, XRD, FTIR and TGA Then, the adsorption behaviors of fluoride on Al-HA-La adsorbent were investigated systematically, including the influence of initial pH, adsorption kinetics, adsorption isotherms, desorption study, etc. Batch adsorption experimental results showed that the high fluoride removal of Al-HA-La was obtained in a wide initial pH range from 5 to 11. The adsorption equilibrium was achieved within 40 min (pH = 7.0), and the adsorption kinetics could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order model. The adsorption isotherms could be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum adsorption capacity calculated from Langmuir model was high up to 50 mg g(-1) at 298 K (pH = 7.0). Moreover, the co-existing of other anions and cations showed limited influence on the adsorption of fluoride on Al-HA-La. Furthermore, the fluoride adsorbed on Al-HA-La could be effectively desorbed using 10(-2) mol L-1 NaOH, and the desorption efficiency was as high as 90%. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Most of existing algorithms have the problems of large computational cost, ringing and noise sensitivity, hence a novel approach by iterative joint bilateral filtering under Bayesian framework is proposed. Firstly, it utilizes defocus image depth estimation to compute the point spread function in the Bayesian framework. Then a minimum optimization problem is built to represent the blind restoration problem. After inferencing the solution procedure of the minimum optimization problem, we find that the joint bilateral filters can be used to search the optimal solution, which not only simplifies the searching procedure but also reduces the computational cost. Finally, an iterative joint bilateral filtering is designed to realize the image restoration. That means that the original restored image obtained from the bilateral filtering is used to design the guide image for the joint bilateral filters, and the guide image will serve as the input of the optimization problem for acquiring the better optimal result. This procedure is repeated until convergence. The experimental results indicate that this method can yield the ringing, reduce the computational cost, and remove the noise. Generally speaking, the average pixel error of 85% images is under 0.03, which has improved 19% comparing with the same error rang of existing algorithms, and 78% shorter than those of compared algorithms. It can be used in the engineering practice of blind restoration for single defocus image.

Besides the interference power threshold to limit the interference on primary users PUs caused by cognitive users CUs, a proportional fairness constraint is used to guarantee fairness among multiple cognitive cells and the impact of imperfect spectrum sensing is taken into account. Additional constraints in typical real communication scenarios are also considered-such as a transmission power constraint of the cognitive base stations, unique subcarrier allocation to at most one CU, and others. The resulting RA problem belongs to the class of NP-hard problems. A computationally efficient optimal algorithm cannot therefore be found. Consequently, we propose a suboptimal RA algorithm composed of two modules: a subcarrier allocation module implemented by the immune algorithm, and a power control module using an improved sub-gradient method. To further enhance algorithm performance, these two modules are executed successively, and the sequence is repeated twice. We conduct extensive simulation experiments, which demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms existing algorithms.

The best Hg(II) capturing performance (90.60%) was observed under the following conditions: initial pH of 7.0, coagulation pH of 6.0, HA-Na dosage of 5.0 g L-1, Al-2(SO4)(3).18H(2)O dosage of 4.0 g L-1, initial Hg(II) concentration of 50 mg L-1 and capturing time of 30 min. The HA-Na compositions with the molecular weight beyond 70 kDa showed the most intense affinity toward Hg(II). The results showed that the reaction equilibrium was achieved within 10 min (pH 7.0), and could be well fitted by the pseudo-second-order kinetics model. The capturing process could be well described by the Langmuir isotherm model and the maximum capturing capacity of Hg (II) was high up to 9.80 mg g(-1) at 298 K (pH 7.0). The Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis showed that the redox reaction between Hg(II) and HA-Na and the coordination reaction of carboxyl and hydroxy groups of HA-Na with Hg(II) were responsible for Hg(II) removal. The successive regeneration experiment showed that the capturing efficiency of humates for Hg(II) was maintained at about 51% after five capture-regeneration recycles.

It is found that only the Pt-L-1 complexes, in which one flexible long chain is attached to each end of 2-phenylpyridine, display monotropic smectic liquid crystalline behavior. Moreover, mechanochromism has been observed by grinding the solid complexes. It seems that the liquid crystalline and mechanochromic properties of these complexes are relative to the number of flexible alkoxy chains in the cyclometalated ligand.

We present that the solution of the inequality is decided by a finite recursion, whose result is proved to be a continuous, bounded or asymptotic function. Meanwhile, in order to overcome an obstacle from powers of integrals, we modify the method of monotonization into the powered monotonization. Furthermore, relying on the result and our technique of concavification, we discuss a generalized stochastic integral inequality, and give an estimate of the mean square. In the end, as applications, we study uniform boundedness and continuous dependence of solutions for a class of stochastic differential equation in mean square.

However, the huge amount of smelting water containing various types of REIs was difficult to separate, which often lead to difficulty in recovery of REIs and water pollution in environment. Selective adsorption was an effective route to recover the REIs in smelting water. Two adsorbents (SiO2-BT, SiO2-BWT) were prepared by grafting plant tannins (Bayberry tannin, Black wattle tannin) onto aminated silica. The as-prepared adsorbents have exhibited a high adsorption capacity to four typical REIs and high selectivity to La3+ among these four REIs (La3+, Ce3+, Pr3+, Nd3+). Furthermore, the after-used adsorbents can be easily regenerated by 0.1mol/L HNO3 solution indicating superior reusability.

Solving this minimization problem gives birth to the efficient RVSSDNLMS algorithm. The convergence performance and computational complexity of RVSSDNLMS algorithm are analyzed. Finally, simulations show that the proposed RVSSDNLMS considerably outperforms the normalized least-mean-square (NLMS), robust variable step-size NLMS, and pseudoaffine projection algorithms in terms of convergence rate and steady-state error in Gaussian noise and impulsive noise environments.

After completion of repair of all broken components, the repairman remains idle for a period of time called changeover time, and then takes a vacation following an arbitrary distribution if there is no operating component breaks down during the changeover time. Applying the supplementary variable method, several reliability measures of the system including the steady-state availability, the steady-state rate of occurrence of failures and the mean time to the first failure are obtained. Meanwhile, some numerical illustrations are presented to demonstrate how the various parameters influence the behaviour of the system. Finally, a special case (n-1)-out-of-n:G system is discussed to validate the correctness of the theoretical results.

It is found that the obtained lattice constants of CdSiP2 under zero pressure and zero temperature from our calculations are in favorable agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical ones. The pressure dependences of the elastic constants C (ij); bulk modulus B; shear modulus G; elastic anisotropy index A (U), A (B), and A (G); and Young's modulus E of CdSiP2 are also successfully obtained for the first time. Especially, the elastic constants C (ij) and the Young's modulus E under high pressure up to 20 GPa are obtained and analyzed systematically for the first time. In addition, our calculations give a band gap of 1.358 eV, indicating that the chalcopyrite structure CdSiP2 is a semiconductor, consistent with other theoretical results. Finally, the optical properties such as the dielectric function, refractive index, absorption coefficient, and extinction coefficient for energy up to 22.5 eV under pressure have also been reported.

The effects of off-axis distance, propagation distance, and three oceanic parameters (i.e., the ratio of temperature to salinity contribution to the refractive index spectrum w, the rate of dissipation of the mean squared temperature X-T and the rate of dissipation of the turbulent kinetic energy epsilon) on radial component of scintillation index are examined. The influences of propagation distance and three oceanic parameters on the longitudinal component of scintillation index are investigated. It is shown that the radial component of scintillation increases as off-axis distance increases. Both radial and longitudinal components of scintillation increase as propagation distance, w and X-T increase while decreases as e increases. Besides, the longitudinal component of scintillation increases more drastically for plane wave than others, which indicates the plane wave is affected the most at the fixed turbulent strength. The longest weak turbulence distance for a plane wave is shorter than that for a Gaussian or spherical wave. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, compounds that could promote GLUT4 translocation into the PM represent potential drugs for the treatment of diabetes. In this research, we screened for agonists that induce GLUT4 translocation by using a novel pH-sensitive fluorescent probe, insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP)-mOrange2. We identified as well as validated one agonist, staurosporine, from a 64,000 compound library. Staurosporine promotes GSVs translocation into the PM and increases glucose uptake through the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway, serving as an effective insulin additive analogue in L6 cells. Our work highlights the convenience and efficiency of this novel pH-sensitive fluorescent probe and reveals the new biological activity of staurosporine as an agonist for GLUT4 translocation and as an effective insulin additive analogue.

Here, using bioinformatics and DNA sequencing approaches, we identified a novel BPH resistance gene, LOC_Os06g03240 (MSU LOCUS ID), from the rice variety Ptb33 in the interval between the markers RM19291 and RM8072 on the short arm of chromosome 6, where a gene for resistance to BPH was mapped by Jirapong Jairin et al. and renamed as "Bph32". This gene encodes a unique short consensus repeat (SCR) domain protein. Sequence comparison revealed that the Bph32 gene shares 100% sequence identity with its allele in Oryza latifolia. The transgenic introgression of Bph32 into a susceptible rice variety significantly improved resistance to BPH. Expression analysis revealed that Bph32 was highly expressed in the leaf sheaths, where BPH primarily settles and feeds, at 2 and 24 h after BPH infestation, suggesting that Bph32 may inhibit feeding in BPH. Western blotting revealed the presence of Pph (Ptb33) and Tph (TN1) proteins using a Penta-His antibody, and both proteins were insoluble. This study provides information regarding a valuable gene for rice defence against insect pests.

There are three different cases which are analyzed in detail: 1) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the energy of the incident electron; 2) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the heights of the barrier; 3) the dependences of dwell time and phase time on the width of the barrier and the molecular field in the spin filter layer. The numerical results show that for the first case, when the electrons have low incident energy (smaller than the barrier height), as the influence of the spin-dependent self-interfere term, the phase times are always larger than the dwell times for electrons with different spinorientations. But when the electrons have high incident energy (higher than the barrier heights), the influence of the self-interfere term disappears and the differences between the phase time and dwell time for electrons with different spin orientations disappear also. For case 2, the numerical results show that the variation of nonmagnetic insulator barrier height has little influence on the dwell time and phase time in NM/SF/I/SF/NM double spin filter junctions. But when the nonmagnetic insulator barrier height is lower than the barrier height of spin filter layer, the quantum well will appear and the resonant tunneling can be induced to lead to the peaks in the dependences of dwell and phase times on the insulator barrier height. The variation of spin-filter barrier height has obvious influence on the dwell time and phase time in NM/SF/I/SF/NM double spin filter junction. With increasing the height of spin-filter barrier, the dwell times and phase time both first increase and then decrease. For case 3, the influences of the widths of the nonmagnetic insulator barrier layer and spin filter layer on the dwell time and phase time are little. But when the barrier height of nonmagnetic insulator barrier is lower than that of spin-filter layer, the variation of width of insulator barrier can lead to the resonant tunneling and the peaks in dwell and phase times. Unlike the influence of width of barrier, the influences of molecular field in the spin filter layer on the dwell time and phase time are obvious. For the up-spin electrons, dwell time and phase time decrease with increasing the molecular fields, which is contrary to the scenario for the down-spin electrons.

Anisotropy is introduced through non-Kolmogorov atmospheric turbulence. The scintillation index results are obtained by employing the Rytov method solution; thus the results are valid for weak anisotropic atmospheric turbulence and for horizontal links. Variations in the scintillations are shown for various higher order laser modes against the changes in the optical source size, power law exponent of anisotropic non-Kolmogorov spectrum, anisotropic factors, and link length. Our results can be used in the design of optical wireless communication systems used between airplanes.

The lattice parameters and elastic constants are in good agreement with the available experimental and theoretical results. The polycrystalline elastic moduli of MgAl2O4 spinel are calculated using the Voigt-Reuss-Hill approximation. By the elastic stability criteria, the MgAl2O4 spinel is mechanically stable within 80 GPa. MgAl2O4 possesses ductile nature, and the ductility is enhanced with the increase of pressure. The sound velocities over a wide range of pressures are also obtained. Furthermore, the elastic anisotropies of MgAl2O4 are investigated via the various anisotropic indexes and the 3D surface constructions. It is found that MgAl2O4 is isotropic for bulk modulus, while is anisotropic for shear modulus and Young's modulus, and the elastic anisotropy of MgAl2O4 increases due to the applying pressure. Besides, the directions with smaller values of shear modulus for MgAl2O4 will deform preferentially under high hydrostatic pressure. Through the quasi- harmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of MgAl2O4 spinel.

In this work, novel layered-spinel integrated cathode materials of (1-x) LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2-xLiMni(1.9)Al(0.1)O(4) were synthesized by a sol-gel method, and their phase structures, morphologies and electrochemical performance were investigated. The crystal structure of the (1-x) LiNi0.5Mn0.5O2-xLiMn(1.9)Al(0.1)O(4) is changed from layered to spinel structure with increasing x. All the samples exhibit nanoscale grains with the minimum grain size of similar to 130 nm when x = 0.5. The composite electrode with x = 0.5 exhibits the optimal discharge capacity, presenting a large initial discharge capacity of 236 mAh g(-1) at the current density of 20 mA g(-1). Good rate capability is also obtained at the composite electrode with x = 0.5 where the electrode displays the relatively high discharge capacity of 64.9 mAh g(-1) at the high rate of 5 C. The improved electrochemical performance is related to the introduction of spinel structure into layered structure and small grain size. The spinel structure can stabilize the layered structure, which leads to the improvement in the electrochemical performance of the composites; and the small grain size in the sample with x = 0.5 provides short lithium ion diffusion way and thus enhances the electrochemical performance.

Photonic switches with ideal switching contrasts for waveguide photons	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SINGLE QUANTUM-DOT; ATOM; CAVITY	Photonic switches are one kind of key devices in quantum optical networks and have been demonstrated previously through either manipulating the cavity-atom interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 111, 193601 (2013)] or driving the additional levels of the switch atoms [Phys. Rev. Lett. 106, 113601 (2011)]. In this paper, we propose an alternative configuration generated by three empty cavities coupled in series to serve as an ideal photonic switch of the photons along the waveguide, i.e., photons are completely transmitted (reflected) if the three cavities are (are not) exactly resonant. It is shown that the quality of such a detuning-sensitive photonic switch is insensitive to the cavity-cavity, cavity-waveguide, and cavity-atom coupling strengths.

The reaction conditions were optimized, including the light intensity, biomass concentration, NaCl addition, and reaction time. The silver nanoparticles fabricated at the optimum conditions (light intensity 60,000 lx, biomass concentration 2 mg/mL, and reaction time 90 min) were characterized by UV-Vis spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and zeta potential. The TEM results showed that the silver nanoparticles were mostly spherical, with an average diameter of 17.2 nm. The zeta potential of AgNPs reached -21.6 mV. The XRD spectra showed that the AgNPs were highly crystalline, with four characteristic peaks. The FTIR of nanoparticles implied that alcohols and proteins may have a vital role in the formation and stability of AgNPs. The silver nanoparticles synthesized by wheat straw biomass revealed antimicrobial activity against Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis strains.

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between cesium (Cs) contamination and plant growing stages in crops or vegetables grown on Cs-contaminated soils. Vicia faba was grown on Cs contaminated soils under pot-culture conditions, and Cs uptake and bioaccumulation at various growing stages were then measured. The results showed that Cs uptake by V. faba was significantly greater on soils with a higher Cs content. As shown by the bioaccumulation factor (BCF), the highest transfer coefficient occurred when V. faba reached the maturation stage. Cs was easily transferred to young organs, especially seeds, with an average percentage of 9.60% in seeds during the maturation stage. This implies that Cs can be transferred to the human food chain at all growth stages of the plant, especially the last stages. Uptake rates of Cs remained stable during the generative growth phase of V. faba. This implies that the cultivation of varieties with short generative growth periods can reduce Cs accumulation in the edible parts of plants. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Tropical forest vegetation maps are very important for managing tropical forests. Mapping tropical forest vegetation only by spectral-based remote sensing techniques has proven to be problematic. The objective of the study is to develop a rule-based model to identify different forest types using LandsatTMimages and GIS. In this paper, we developed the rule-based model to identify different forest types in Xishuangbanna, P.R. of China, using two temporal Landsat TM images and geo-data such as DEM, rainfall and temperature. The results show that the method put forward is useful and effective in tropical forest vegetation mapping, which can effectively integrate multi-knowledge and multi-resource data to identify the tropical forest vegetation types with higher accuracy.

In this work, La2O3-coated Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 cathode materials were fabricated via a combined method of sol-gel and wet chemical processes. The structural and morphological characterizations of the materials demonstrate that a thin layer of La2O3 is uniformly covered on the surface of Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 particles, and the coating of La2O3 has no obvious effect on the crystal structure of Li-rich oxide. The electrochemical performance of La2O3-coated Li-rich cathodes including specific capacity, cycling stability and rate capability has been significantly improved with the coating of La2O3. The Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 coated with 2.5 wt% La2O3 exhibits the highest discharge capacity, improved cycling stability and reduced charge transfer resistance, delivering a large discharge capacity of 276.9 mAh g(-1) in the 1st cycle and a high capacity retention of 71% (201.4 mAh g(-1)) after 100 cycles. The optimal rate capability of the materials is observed at the coating level of 1.5 wt% La2O3 such that the material exhibits the highest discharge capacity of 90.2 mAh g(-1) at 5 C. The surface coating of La2O3 can effectively facilitate Li+ interfacial diffusion, reduce the structural change and secondary reactions between cathode materials and electrolyte during the charge-discharge process, and thus induce the great enhancement in the electrochemical properties of the Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2 materials.

Longer-term psychological consequences remain unclear. This study explored psychological symptoms in secondary school students who were living in Sichuan province 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake. Methods: A secondary data analysis was performed on data from a final survey of survivors conducted 6 years after the Wenchuan earthquake as part of the five-year mental health and psychosocial support project. A total of 2641 participants were divided into three groups, according to the level of traumatic experience exposure during the earthquake (0, 1, and 2 or more). ANCOVA was used to compare the mean scores of the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) among the three groups, adjusting for covariates such as age, gender, ethnicity, having a sibling, parents' divorce, and socio-economic status. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify relationships between the traumatic experiences and suicidality after the disaster. Results: Having two or more kinds of traumatic experiences was associated with higher psychological symptom scores on the SCL-90 (Cohen's d=0.23-033) and suicidal ideation (OR 1.98, 95% Cls:1.35-2.89) and attempts (OR 3.32, 95% Cls:1.65-6.68), as compared with having no traumatic experience. Limitations: Causality cannot be inferred from this cross-sectional survey, and results may not generalize to other populations due to convenience sampling. Conclusions: Severely traumatized adolescent survivors of the earthquake may suffer from psychological symptoms even 6 years after the disaster. Long-term psychological support will be needed for these individuals. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The crystal structure of the La-PZTC can be speculated to monoclinic system, P2(1)/c space group based on Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, Thermogravimetric analysis and elemental analysis. Time-dependent experiment was performed to explore temporal morphological evolution, indicating the nucleation and growth of the products take place in a very short time. The luminescent properties of the as-obtained lanthanum pyrazine-2,3,5,6-tetracarboxylate samples have been discussed in detail. Under UV excitation, Eu3+ or Tb3+ doped La-PZTC samples exhibit strong red and green emission, corresponding to the characteristic lines of Eu3+ or Tb3+, respectively. Interestingly, the luminescence color of phosphors can be fine-tuned from green to green-yellow, yellow, and red-orange by simply adjusting the concentrations of Eu3+ and Tb3+ ions, making the material has potential applications in building mini-optoelectronic devices and color display fields.

It exhibits different cation occupancy and band gap from normal spinel zinc ferrite. Regarding that band structure plays an essential role in the gas sensing property of semiconducting material, the gas sensing properties of normal spinel and partially inverse spinel are measured and compared. With the favorable adsorption and moderate conductance, the partially inverse spinel zinc ferrite exhibits superior performance both in gas response and selectivity towards H2S. The optimum operating temperature is found to be 260 degrees C and the response time and recovery time are short. The excellent gas sensing properties is attributed to the favorable adsorption and change of it band structure due to special partially inverse spinel structure. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The surface morphology of TiO2 films was studied by atomic force microscopy (AFM). The chemic states of Ti and O elements were measured by X-ray photoelectron spectrum (XPS). The resistive switching property of the sample was measured using Au/TiO2/Pt capacitor structure fabricated by evaporating Au top electrode. Smooth surface and dense cross structure were observed by AFM and scanning electron microscopy. Oxygen vacancies in TiO2 film were confirmed by XPS. Forming free resistance switching was confirmed by the current voltage measurement and the resistance ratio is larger than two orders of magnitude at 2.5 V.

J	Wu, SG; Jiang, MQ; Liu, L				Wu, Shaogui; Jiang, Manqin; Liu, Ling			Mechanism of pyrophosphate ion release in T7 RNA polymerase revealed by free energy simulations	COMPUTATIONAL AND THEORETICAL CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Molecular dynamics simulation; T7 RNA polymerase; PPi release; Potential of mean force	PARTICLE MESH EWALD; MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS; TRANSLOCATION; DNA	In this article, we explored pyrophosphate ion (PPi) release mechanism in T7 RNAP using all-atom free energy simulations in explicit solvent. Steered Molecular Dynamics (SMD) and Umbrella Sampling (US) methods were combined to estimate the potential of mean force (PMF) for the PPi release in T7 RNAP. PPi is a small group with negative charges. After binding a Mg2+ ion, the formed (Mg-PPi)(2-) complex is able to bind with both positively and negatively charged groups. Our simulation results show there is a large free energy barrier in the PMF profile for PPi release. Non-bonded interaction analysis suggests that the PPi is firmly trapped in the pore region of the secondary channel, which is composed of many polar, negatively and positively charged groups. Strong electric interactions from the surrounding groups contribute mostly to the high energy barrier for PPi release. Hydrogen bond map clearly exhibits part of the interaction network that the PPi has been trapped in. Therefore, we conclude that PPi is less likely to be released spontaneously. Additional energy input is needed to facilitate this process. It is deduced that NTP addition reaction may serve as an energy provider to drive PPi release. Then the whole NAC mechanism can be well explained. It is expected that our study provides a clear picture on the essential step of RNA transcription at atom-level resolution. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

The mechanism of its antidiabetic effect has been known as it can competitively inhibit sodium-glucose symporters (SGLTs). However, phlorizin has a wide range of two-phase metabolism in systemic circulation and shows poor oral bioavailability. An alternative mechanism may involve gut microbiota in intestine. Sixteen obese mice with type 2 diabetes (db/db) and eight age-matched control mice (db/+) were divided into three groups: diabetic group treated with phlorizin (DMT group), vehicle-treated diabetic group (DM group), and normal control group (CC group). Phlorizin was given in normal saline solution by intragastric administration for 10 weeks. After the last treatment course, body weight, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), insulin resistance, and fecal short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were compared. 16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and quantitative PCR were used to determine the changes in microbiome composition. Coadministration of phlorizin significantly prevented metabolic syndrome by decreasing weight gain, energy intake, serum lipopolysaccharides, and insulin resistance, and the fecal level of total SCFAs was dramatically increased, especially butyric acid. DGGE and quantitative PCR demonstrated that phlorizin coadministration increased the gut microbial diversity and the growth of Akkermansia muciniphila and Prevotella. Meanwhile, the gut microbiota structure of db/db mice after phlorizin treatment was improved and approached the normal group. The mechanism of the hypoglycemic action of phlorizin is associated with LPS decrease and gut microbiota changes; briefly, it acts in the intestine to modify gut microbial community structure, resulting in lower LPS load in the host and higher SCFAs producing beneficial bacteria.

It is found that photoluminescence (PL) spectra for the dimers show concentration dependences. In dilute solution (10(-7) mol.L-1), maxima of PL peak for dimers was located at 657 nm, which has identical PL peak with single porphyrin, HAcTPP. When concentration was increased to 10(-3) mol.L-1, the maximal PL peak value (675 nrn) for the dimeric porphyrins exhibited 18 nm bathochromic shift (relative to single porphyrin, HAcTPP). Moreover, the concentration dependence PL spectra become more sensitive for dimeric complexes that were obtained by refluxing dimeric porphyrin with PtCl2 in benzonitrile solution. The maximal PL peak values (about 673 nrn) for dimers complexes showed 16 nm red-shifts compared with that for HAcTPP even in 10(-7) mol.L-1 dilute THE solution. With concentration increase to 10(-4) mol.L-1, the emission peak for complexes of dimeric porphyrin was at 727 nm, which is red-shifted to near-infrared range. To examine the correlation between the luminescence and intermolecular pi-pi and/or Pt(II)-Pt(II) interactions for the dimeric complexes, the solid-state luminescence for the dimeric complex, Pt2C3(AmTPP)(2), at room temperature and 77 K was measured, which showed low-energy emissions with a maximum at 658 nm at room temperature. Upon cooling the solid sample to 77 K, the solid sample exhibited red-shift of 16 nm (from 658 to 674 nm) and there was more structured spectrum with an additional weak emission at 706 nm. Furthermore, sublimating films of the complexes also yielded red-shift emission at about 727 nm and broadened PL profile with an additional tailing at 760 similar to 810 nm, which would account for more intensive pi-pi interaction and/or Pt(II)-Pt(II) interaction in sublimating films.

To enable catalyst recovery, noble metal nanoparticles are often supported onto solid matrices to prepare heterogeneous catalyst. Although recycle of noble metal nanoparticles is realized by heterogenization, a loss of activity is usually encountered. In the present investigation, Pt nanoparticles with tunable particle size (1.85-2.80 nm) were facilely prepared by using polyphenols as amphiphilic stabilizers. The as-prepared Pt nanoparticles colloid solution could be used as highly active catalyst in aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis. The phenolic hydroxyls of polyphenols could constrain Pt nanoparticles in aqueous phase, and simultaneously, the aromatic scaffold of polyphenols ensured effective interactions between substrates and Pt nanoparticles. As a consequence, the obtained polyphenols-stabilized Pt nanoparticles exhibited high activity and cycling stability in biphasic hydrogenation of a series of unsaturated compounds. Compared with conventional heterogeneous Pt-C and Pt-Al2O3 catalysts, polyphenols-stabilized Pt nanoparticles showed obvious advantage both in activity and cycling stability.

The Min(N, V)-policy means that the server commences its service once the number of waiting customers reaches threshold N or when its vacation time ends with at least one but less than N customers waiting for processing, whichever occurs first. Otherwise, if no customer is presenting at the end of the server vacation, the server remains idle until the first arrival occurs. Under these assumptions, the z-transform expressions for the transient queue size distribution at time epoch n(+) are obtained by employing the renewal process theory and the total probability decomposition technique. Based on the transient analysis, the explicit recursive formulas of the steady-state queue length distribution at time epochs n(broken vertical bar), n, n and outside observer's time epoch are derived, respectively. Additionally, the stochastic decomposition structure is presented and some other performance measures are also discussed. Furthermore, some computational experiments are implemented to demonstrate the significant application value of the recursive formulas for the steady-state queue size in designing system capacity. Finally, the optimal threshold of N for economizing the system cost is numerically determined.

We studied the degradation of lignin and cellulose in the foliar litter of four dominant riparian species (willow: Salix paraplesia; azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum; cypress: Sabina saltuaria; and larch: Larix mastersiana) in an alpine forest river. Over an entire year's incubation, litter lignin and cellulose degraded by 14.7-100% and 57.7-100% of their initial masses, respectively, depending on litter species. Strong degradations of lignin and cellulose occurred in the prefreezing period (i.e., the first 41 d) during litter decomposition, and the degradation rate was the highest among all the decomposition periods regardless of litter species. Litter species, decomposition period, and environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability showed significant influences on lignin and cellulose degradation rates. Compared with previously reported data regarding the dynamics of lignin and cellulose during litter decomposition in terrestrial ecosystems, our results suggest that lignin and cellulose can be degraded much more rapidly in lotic ecosystems, indicating that the traditionally used two-phased model for the dynamics of lignin in decomposing litter may not be suitable in lotic ecosystems.

The analytical formulae for the seeing parameter and the tilt variance in oceanic turbulence are derived, and it is found that the relationship between the seeing parameter and the spatial coherence width in oceanic turbulence is just like that in atmospheric turbulence. Furthermore, the model of underwater imaging shown in this paper considers both temperature and salinity fluctuations for oceanic turbulence. It is found that, compared with the dominating salinity-induced turbulence, the range of angular spatial frequency where oceanic turbulence plays the major role rather than particle scattering is higher for the dominating temperature-induced turbulence.

An example of light waves on scattering from a collection of particles with random distribution is discussed, and the conditions for producing identical normalized spectral density and that for producing identical spectral degree of coherence are investigated.

The maximum perpendicular field components appearing around the turns located at the two coil ends degrade the critical current and energy storage capacity of the whole coil, and even cause significant AC loss and possible hot-spots during practical SMES operations. To enhance the critical current and reduce the ac loss of the turns located at the two coil ends, this paper investigates a novel ferromagnetic raised-edge disk structure for adjusting the magnetic field orientation to be as close as possible to a parallel angle. Finite element simulations and performance comparisons with a test 0.2-H Bi-2223 solenoid coil without any ferromagnetic disk, with a conventional flat disk, and with the proposed raised-edge disk are presented. The results obtained show that the proposed raised-edge disk has much better effects towards critical current improvement and AC loss reduction compared to a conventional flat disk, especially for the terminal coil turns near the inner wall of the whole coil.

The structural design, magnetic modeling, and equivalent circuit simulation of a pot-core rotating transformer using an HTS primary are presented to analyze the transfer power and efficiency characteristics of a 9-kW class CPT device. The corresponding superconducting ac loss properties of the HTS primary are also discussed to construct a circuit-field-superconductor-coupled analysis model and thus to clarify the functional relationships among the transfer power, the ac loss, and its equivalent resistance in the rotary-type CPT system.

Here, two simple donor-(pi conjugated spacer)-acceptor dyes, in which hexyloxy-substituted phenyl as an electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor and different spacers thiophene (LD03) or furan (LD04) as the pi-linkers, were designed and synthesized as co-sensitizers for N719-based DSSCs. The photophysical, electrochemical, photovoltaic performances and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy of these DSSCs were investigated in detail. When compared to the DSSCs fabricated from individual N719, the co-sensitized DSSCs (N719 + LD03 and N719 + LD04) showed significantly enhanced power conversion efficiencies (PCEs), short-circuit photocurrent density (J(sc)) and open circuit voltage (V-oc) simultaneously, which owing to the co-sensitizers could effectively overcome the competitive light absorption by I-3(-) in the electrolyte, avoid dye aggregation and reduce the charge recombination. Consequently, the co-sensitized DSSC (N719 + LD04) gave the highest PCE of 8.955% (J(sc) = 17.628 mA cm(-2), V-oc = 0.758 V and fill factor = 0.670), exhibiting an improvement of 13.412% compared to the device sensitized with N719 alone (PCE = 7.896%) under illumination (AM 1.5G, 100 mW cm(-2)).

The superconducting dc cables are favored for both high-efficiency power transmission under normal conditions and self-triggering fault-current-limiting operation under fault conditions. The SMES-based HESS is integrated, with the merits of fast response speed and high-power density from the SMES, and high-energy density and high-economic efficiency from conventional battery energy storage (BES), and thus, is much more effective a sole SMES or BES device for smoothing the line voltage fluctuations caused by some sudden load variations or short-circuit faults. The simulation results obtained from energy efficiency analyses and energy management simulations show that the proposed superconducting LVDC network has significant advantages in high-efficiency, high-quality power transmission and distribution compared to conventional ac networks.

State-of-the-art CoolMOS MOSFETs are introduced and immersed in liquid nitrogen to save about 85% of conduction losses. Considering the anisotropy of gadolinium barium copper oxide (GdBCO) tapes, ferromagnetic disks with raised edges are optimized to enhance the critical current and reduce the hysteresis loss of the HTS smoothing inductor. As compared to the conventional boost chopper composed of ambient-temperature power electronics and a copper inductor, the total operational loss from the cryogenic MOSFETs and the HTS inductor in the proposed cryogenic boost chopper is reduced by 87% in the case of a 40-kW chopper.

However, the magnetic field in an HTS transformer affects the transformer's HTS winding performances. The relationship between HTS tape characteristics and the magnetic field has been studied. The HTS windings critical current can be increased with the perpendicular magnetic field decreasing. A concept of unbalanced degree is introduced in this paper. The unbalanced degree of critical current distributions at the ends of windings decreases with the perpendicular magnetic field and the unbalanced degree of perpendicular magnetic field distributions decreasing. For the effects of flux diverter, the unbalanced degrees of perpendicular magnetic field and critical current distributions are analyzed and optimized.

By performing direct numerical simulations, we investigate the formation and dynamics of the vortices in the wake as a function of the moving velocity and the radius of the potential. For moderate moving velocity, we observe the formation of a bound vortex pair in the wake of the potential. Its shedding period and associated patterns depend on the radius of the potential, showing V-shaped, periodic, or complex wakes. More interestingly, at high velocity both the vortex pair and vortex dipole can be formed simultaneously. Furthermore, the activation time for vortex formation is investigated for different velocities. We also give an experimental protocol to observe these phenomena in future experiments.

A two-year field study conducted in an alpine forest meta-ecosystem-with four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that varied widely in chemical traits showed that both litter species and ecosystem type (i.e., forest floor, stream and riparian zone) are important factors affecting litter decomposition, and their effects can be moderated by local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability. Litter decomposed fastest in the streams followed by the riparian zone and forest floor regardless of species. For a given litter species, both the k value and limit value varied significantly among ecosystems, indicating that the litter decomposition rate and extent (i.e., reaching a limit value) can be substantially affected by ecosystem type and the local-scale environmental factors. Apart from litter initial acid unhydrolyzable residue (AUR) concentration and its ratio to nitrogen concentration (i.e., AUR/N ratio), the initial nutrient concentrations of phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) were also important litter traits that affected decomposition depending on the ecosystem type.

We find that the three metallocen molecules structure become stretched along the transport direction, the distance between two C-p rings longer than the other theory and experiment results. The lager conductance is found in nickelocene molecule, the main transmission channel is the electron coupling between molecule and the electrodes is through the Ni d(xz) and d(yz) orbitals and the s, d(xz) d(yz) of gold. This is also confirmed by the highest occupied molecular orbital resonance at Fermi level. In addition, negative differential resistance effect is found in the ferrocene, cobaltocene molecules, this is also closely related with the evolution of the transmission spectrum under applied bias.

The obtained results observed that the ferromagnetic order is the most stable ground state and the magnetic moment will collapse at about 50 GPa. As a result, the lattice a axis becomes stiffer above about 420 GPa, ultimately presenting the same axial compressibility trends with those of nonmagnetic compounds Mo2TiAlC2 and hypothetical Cr2TiAlC2. The elastic constants and phonon dispersion curves demonstrate the structural stability during the disappearance of magnetic moment and occurrence of axial alternative compressibility. The density of states and energy band calculations confirmed the existence of magnetic moment of Cr2TiAlC2 at 0 GPa and disappearance at high pressures above 50 GPa.

In this work, a novel, cloud cap-like and phosphorus/nitrogen co-containing biomass carbon material derived from mushroom as cathode host materials for lithium sulfur batteries were fabricated by a facile H3PO4 activation method. The porous carbon carbonized at 650 degrees C contains abundant micro/mesopores and possesses the high BET surface area of 788 m(2) g(-1) and the main pore size of 1.1-2.5 nm, which can boost the adsorption of sulfur and polysulphides by melt-diffusion technology. The sulfur/biomass carbon composite delivers the high initial specific capacity of 1357.8 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and high capacity retention of 729 mA h g(-1) after 100 cycles due to its specific porous structure. The relatively high discharge capacity of 213 mA h g(-1) is exhibited in the composite even after 72 cycles at higher discharge rates (0.2 C, 0.3 C, 0.5 C, 1 C and 2 C). All these superior performances well validate the excellent stability and reversibility of the biomass porous carbon as a promising cathode matrix for lithium-sulfur batteries. In addition, the biomass carbon derived from mushroom contains simultaneously phosphorus and nitrogen, which can improve the specific capacity. For the present carbon materials, the special porous structure may encapsulate sulfur particles, inhibit the dissolution of polysulphides in the electrolyte and thus lead to the excellent performances of the materials. Our study shows that the porous biochar arising from mushroom can be easily fabricated and considered as the promising conductive materials for high performance lithium-sulfur batteries.

Their mechanical properties were investigated by nanoindentation and the Vickers indentation measuring methods. It was found that the nano-grained YAG transparent ceramics exhibited much better ductility compared with the coarse-grained counterparts.

J	He, K; Wang, D; Zheng, XQ				He, Kun; Wang, Dan; Zheng, Xiuqing			Image segmentation on adaptive edge-preserving smoothing	JOURNAL OF ELECTRONIC IMAGING			English	Article						edge-preserving smoothing; region-confidence level; clustering algorithm; image segmentation	EVOLUTION	Nowadays, typical active contour models are widely applied in image segmentation. However, they perform badly on real images with inhomogeneous subregions. In order to overcome the drawback, this paper proposes an edge-preserving smoothing image segmentation algorithm. At first, this paper analyzes the edge-preserving smoothing conditions for image segmentation and constructs an edge-preserving smoothing model inspired by total variation. The proposed model has the ability to smooth inhomogeneous subregions and preserve edges. Then, a kind of clustering algorithm, which reasonably trades off edge-preserving and subregion-smoothing according to the local information, is employed to learn the edge-preserving parameter adaptively. At last, according to the confidence level of segmentation subregions, this paper constructs a smoothing convergence condition to avoid oversmoothing. Experiments indicate that the proposed algorithm has superior performance in precision, recall, and F-measure compared with other segmentation algorithms, and it is insensitive to noise and inhomogeneous-regions.

To improve their applicable property of mesomorphic temperature ranges, we exploit the binary mixtures of electronic donor-acceptor DLC materials. The electron-rich 2,3,6,7,10,11-hexakis(alkoxy) triphenylenes (C4, C6, C8, C10, C12) and an electron-deficient tetrapentyl triphenylene-2,3,6,10-tetracarboxylate have been prepared and their binary mixtures have been investigated. The mesomorphism of the 1:1 (molar ratio) mixtures has been characterized by polarizing optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small angel x-ray scattering (SAXS). The self-assembled monolayer structure of a discogen on a solid-liquid interface has been imaged by the high resolution scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). The match of peripheral chain length has important influence on the mesomorphism of the binary mixtures.

Here, two novel metal-free organic dyes, in which dithiafulvenyl unit was introduced into phenothiazine donor as an additional electron donor, cyanoacrylic acid as the electron acceptor, and without (PTZ-2) or with (PTZ-3) a benzene as the pi-linker between phenothiazine donor and cyanoacrylic acid electron-withdrawing group, were synthesized by modifying the simple D-pi-A dye (PTZ-1) and successfully utilized in DSSCs. Their photophysical, electrochemical, photovoltaic properties and theoretical calculations were further investigated. Relative to the reference dye PTZ-1, the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) increased significantly from 4.04% to 5.81% (PTZ-2) and 5.22% (PTZ-3), which came mainly from the enhancement of short-circuit current (J(sc)) due to the broader molecular absorption spectra and higher molar extinction coefficients. What's more, it is worth noting that the dyes of PTZ-2 and PTZ-3 have strong absorption, which can compensate for that of N719 in the low wavelength region, especially in the region of similar to 300-500 nm. Therefore, a co-sensitization approach has been used for achieving enhanced performances in DSSCs wherein N719 was co-sensitized with PTZ-2 and PTZ-3, respectively. Consequently, the co-sensitized DSSC (PTZ-2 + N719) gave the highest efficiency of 8.12%, exhibiting an improvement of 16.50% compared to the device sensitized with N719 alone (PCE = 6.97%) under the same conditions.

In addition, we investigate the influence of heating holding time and also compare the observed TME in current study with that of shape memory alloys (SMAs). It is concluded that the TME via DSC (without any macroscopic shape change) is achievable within the glass transition range of a polymer. Conversely, although the observed TME shares the many similar features as those in SMAs, due to the nature of micro-Brownian motion in the glass transition of polymers, the resulted TME is strongly affected by the heating holding time.

Reaction of (LH2)-H-n with two equivalents of AlR'(3) (R' = Me, Et) afforded dinuclear alkylaluminium complexes [(AlR'(2))(2)L1-3] (R = R' = Me (1), R = tBu, R' = Me (2), R = Cl, R' = Me (3), R = Me, R' = Et (4), R = tBu, R' = Et (5), R = Cl, R' = Et (6)). For comparative studies, reactions of two equivalents of AlR3' (R' = Me, Et) with the macrocycle derived from 2,2*-ethylenedianiline and 2,6-dicarboxy-R-phenols (R = Me (LH2)-H-4, tBu (LH2)-H-5) were conducted; the complexes [(AlMe)(AlMe2)L-5]center dot 2 1/4MeCN (7.2-1-,MeCN) and [(AIEt(2))(2)L-4] (8) were isolated. Use of limited AIEt(3) with (LH2)-H-3 or (LH2)-H-5 afforded mononuclear bis(macrocyclic) complexes [Al(L-3)((LH)-H-3)]center dot 4toluene (9-4toluene) and [Al(L-5)((LH)-H-5)]center dot 5MeCN (10.5MeCN), respectively. Use of four equivalents of AlR'(3) led to transfer of alkyl groups and isolation of the complexes [(AlR'(2))(4)L1'-3) (R = L-2', R' = Me (11); L-3', R' = Me (12); L-1', R' = Et (13); L-2', R' = Et (14); L-3', R' = Et (15)), where L-1,L--3' is the macrocycle resulting from double alkyl transfer to imine, namely ([2-(O)-5-(R)C6H2-1-(CH)-3-C(R')H][(O)(2-(N)-2'C6H4N)(2)]}(2). Molecular structures of complexes 7.2 1/4MeCN, 8, 9.4toluene, 10.5MeCN and 11-1 3/4toluene.1 1/4hexane are reported. These complexes act as catalysts for the ring opening polymerisation (ROP) of epsilon-caprolactone and rac-lactide; high conversions were achieved over 30 min at 80 degrees C for epsilon-caprolactone, and 110 degrees C over 12 h for rac-lactide.

J	Huang, Z; Long, CY; Zhou, X; Xu, M				Huang Zheng; Long Chao-Yun; Zhou Xun; Xu Ming			Study on tunneling magnetoresistance effects in parabolic well magnetic tunneling junction with double barriers	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						spin-orbit coupling; magnetic tunneling junction; tunneling magnetoresistance	TRANSPORT-PROPERTIES; FIELDS	In this paper, we construct a ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet parabolic well magnetic tunneling junction with double barriers as research object by inserting another semiconductor as a barrier between ferromagnetic and semiconductor potential wells. On the basis of the quantum coherent transport theory and transfer matrix method, we investigate the spin polarized electron transport and the tunnel magnetic resistance (TMR) in parabolic well magnetic tunneling junction with double barriers. We derive the analytical expressions of transmission probability, tunnel magnetic resistance and spin polarization from the new magnetic tunneling junction mode. The significant quantum size, Rashba spin orbit interaction, the angle effect and the thickness of the double barriers layer are discussed simultaneously. The results indicate that the tunnel magnetic resistance shows periodic variation as the width of the parabolic-well at different angles. The TMR is monotonically decreasing when the angle theta varying from 0 to pi, which reflects the structure of the spin valve effect. Meanwhile, results also show that the spin polarization and the tunnel magnetic resistance oscillate with the same period for different barriers thickness. The phase difference appears after inserting the barriers. With increasing the barriers width, phase difference becomes large. The amplitude and peak to alley ratio of the spin polarization and the tunnel magnetic resistance are increase with the barrier width increases. Furthermore, the spin polarization make quasiperiodic oscillation that the oscillation amplitudes become large, the period and peak to alley ratio are decrease as the Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength increases. It appears the spin flip phenomenon as increasing the thickness of the barriers. The TMR shows the typical properties of resonant tunneling with the increasing of the spin orbit coupling strength. In order to better reveal the role of the symmetry double tunnel barriers in the parabolic well structure, we calculate TMR against the thickness of the double barriers. It is found that the existence of the double tunnel barriers increase the TMR and the spin polarization significantly, which shows that the large TMR value can be obtained with the suitable layer thickness of the double barriers layer and the Rashba spin-orbital coupling coefficients. These characteristics are helpful to promote the development and application of new magnetic tunnel junctions.

Structure of the complex was characterized by various physico-chemical methods and single crystal X-ray diffraction. X-ray crystal structure determination reveals that the complex crystallizes as monoclinic space group Cc, with unit cell dimensions a = 13.497(2) angstrom, b = 9.558(2) angstrom, c = 7.010(1) angstrom, beta = 91.447(2)degrees, V = 904.1(3) angstrom(3), Z = 4, R-1 = 0.0461, wR(2) = 0.1240. The asymmetric unit of the compound contains a [AgL] complex moiety and a water molecule of crystallization. Each Ag atom is coordinated by two amino nitrogen atoms, forming a linear geometry. The ligand bridged two silver atoms has a distance of 7.683(2) angstrom. In the crystal structure of the compound, the silver atoms are linked through 3,5-diaminobenzoate ligands, forming chains running along the a axis. The chains are further linked by water molecules through intermolecular N-H center dot center dot center dot O and O-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, to generate a three-dimensional network. In addition, pi center dot center dot center dot pi interactions are observed among the chains. Silver complexes are cytotoxic to most cancer cell lines. The complex in the present work is cytotoxic on human lung cancer cell line A549, with the IC50 value of 11.5 +/- 1.7-mu M.

Then, motivated by the idea of traditional arithmetic operation, we have developed some aggregation operators for aggregating hesitant fuzzy linguistic information: hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted average (HFLWA) operator, hesitant fuzzy linguistic ordered weighted average (HFLOWA) operator and hesitant fuzzy linguistic hybrid average (HFLHA) operator. Furthermore, we propose the concept of the dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic set and develop some aggregation operators with dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic information. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the hesitant fuzzy linguistic multiple attribute decision making problems. Finally, a practical example is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

Methods: Comprehensive literature searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) values were calculated to assess the correlations of pre-chemotherapy SUV (SUV1), post-chemotherapy SUV (SUV2), SUV Ratio, total lesion glycolysis (TLG) and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) with event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Results: Twenty-three studies with 1261 patients were identified. The combined HRs for EFS were 1.84 (95% CI: 1.54-2.20) for SUV1, 2.92 (95% CI: 2.15-3.97) for SUV2, 1.90 (95% CI: 1.43-2.52) for SUV Ratio, 3.01 (95% CI: 1.36-6.67) for TLG and 2.32 (95% CI: 1.44-3.75) for MTV. The pooled HRs for OS were 1.85 (95% CI: 1.49-2.30) for SUV1, 2.00 (95% CI: 1.39-2.88) for SUV2, 2.20 (95% CI: 1.18-4.10) for SUV Ratio, 6.19 (95% CI: 2.17-17.66) for TLG and 2.67 (95% CI: 1.52-4.68) for MTV. Besides, high SUV1 was found to be significantly associated with higher rate of metastasis (RR 5.55, 95% CI: 2.75-11.18) and local recurrence (RR 1.87 95% CI: 1.28-2.72). Conclusion: (18)F-FDG PET parameters of SUV1, SUV2, SUV Ratio, TLG and MTV may have effective prognostic significance for patients with bone and soft tissue sarcoma. (18)F-FDG PET imaging may be a promising tool to help predict survival outcomes of these patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

It is shown that, when the zenith angle. is not large enough, it is always sigma(2)(I up) > sigma(I) (2)(down) down on propagation whatever the value of the obscure ratio epsilon is, where sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) are the on-axis scintillation index in uplink and downlink, respectively. However, when theta is large enough, sigma(I) (2)(down) is close to sigma(2)(I up) as the propagation distance theta increases, and sigma(2)(I up) and sigma(I) (2)(down) overlap each other as epsilon increases. Furthermore, as theta increases, sigma(2)(I up) approaches an asymptotical value when theta is not large enough, and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(2)(I up) appears when theta is large enough. But the asymptotical value and the saturation phenomenon of sigma(I) (2)(down) never appear. On the other hand, the energy focusability in downlink is better than that in uplink, and the difference of energy focusability between a downlink and an uplink increases with increasing theta or decreasing epsilon. In addition, in downlink there may exist sidelobes of intensity distributions when theta is not large enough, but the sidelobes never appear in uplink.

Four litter species (i.e., willow: Salix paraplesia, azalea: Rhododendron lapponicum, cypress: Sabina saltuaria, and larch: Larix mastersiana) that had varying initial litter chemical traits were placed separately in litterbags and then incubated on the soil surface of forest floor plots or in the water of the stream and riparian zone plots. Litterbags were retrieved five times each year during the two-year experiment, with nine replicates each time for each treatment. The results suggested that foliar litter lost 32.2%-89.2% of the initial dry mass depending on litter species and ecosystem type after two-year's incubation. The cellulose lost 60.1%-96.8% of the initial mass with degradation rate in the order of stream > riparian zone > forest floor. Substantial cellulose degradation occurred at the very beginning (i.e., in the first pre-freezing period) of litter decomposition. Litter initial concentrations of phosphorus (P) and lignin were found to be the dominant chemical traits controlling cellulose degradation regardless of ecosystems type. The local-scale environmental factors such as temperature, pH, and nutrient availability were important moderators of cellulose degradation rate. Although the effects of common litter chemical traits (e.g., P and lignin concentrations) on cellulose degradation across different individual ecosystems were identified, local-scale environmental factors such as temperature and nutrient availability were found to be of great importance for cellulose degradation. These results indicated that local-scale environmental factors should be considered apart from litter quality for generating a reliable predictive framework for the drivers of cellulose degradation and further on litter decomposition at a global scale.

Using Pt-n clusters as catalytic models, we studied the selective hydrogenation reaction mechanism for CAL catalyzed by Pt-n (n = 6, 10, 14, 18) clusters by means of B3LYP in density functional theory at the 6-31+ G(d) level (the LanL2DZ extra basis set was used for the Pt atom). The rationality of the transition state was proved by vibration frequency analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate computation. Moreover, atoms in molecules theory and nature bond orbital theory were applied to discuss the interaction among orbitals and the bonding characteristics. The results indicate that three kinds of products, namely 3-phenylpropyl aldehyde, 3-phenyl allyl alcohol and cinnamyl alcohol, are produced in the selective hydrogenation reaction catalyzed by Pt-n clusters; each pathway possesses two reaction channels. Pt-n clusters are more likely to catalyze the activation and hydrogenation of the C = O bond in CAL molecules, eventually producing cinnamic alcohol, which proves that Pt-n clusters have a strong reaction selectivity to catalyze CAL. The reaction selectivity of the catalyzer cluster is closely related to the size of the Pt-n cluster, with Pt-14 clusters having the greatest reaction selectivity.

J	Liu, L; Liang, HT				Liu, Lu; Liang, Haoting			Influence Analysis for Celebrities via Public Cloud and Social Platform	CHINA COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						cloud computing; social media analytics; large deviation principle	TV	Recently, the online social networks have emerged as one of the important platforms for social users. Among millions of users, famous person from entertainment circle arouse our interest. They promote social relationship and establish their reputation via these platforms. To analyze the social influence of entertainment stars, we propose and implement a public cloud based framework to crawl celebrities' social messages from Sina Weibo, store the gathered messages, and conduct various analysis to assess the social influence. It consist of three key components: task generation, resource management and task scheduling, and influence analysis. The task generation is responsible of acquiring celebrities' social accounts and issue crawling tasks. We propose a cross-media method to extract social accounts from webpages. The resource management and task scheduling will dynamic adjust the rented resource to minimize the total computing cost while keeping QoS. We propose a dynamic instance provisioning strategy based on the large deviation principle. The influence analysis will undertake various types of analysis, such as fan count, posting frequency, textual analysis, and so on. More than 10,000 celebrities' microblogs have been gathered so far, and some related gainers, such as celebrities and ad agencies can gain the illumination brought by our analysis.

The calculated lattice constants a and c are in agreement with the available experimental data and similar theoretical calculations. Through a series of researches, the mechanical parameters (the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, and Young's modulus) and Debye temperature, the wave velocities are systematically investigated. Additionally, the mechanical anisotropy has been characterized by calculating Young's modulus and described by the three-dimensional (3D) surface constructions and its projections. By using the born stability criteria and phonon frequency, it is concluded that the beta-Si3N4 is stable mechanically and dynamically up to 35 GPa. Finally, the thermal properties have been calculated by employing the quasi-harmonic Debye model at different temperatures (0-800 K) and pressures (0-35 GPa).	[Hou, H. J.; Zhu, H. J.; Lao, C.

The effects of heat treatment temperatures and Zn doping on the structure, photocathodic protection and photoelectrochemical properties of TiO2 thin films were investigated. It is indicated that the photoelectrical performance of the Zn-TiO2 films is enhanced with the addition of Zn element compared with the pure-TiO2 film and the largest decline by 897 mV in the electrode potential is achieved under 300 degrees C heat treatment. SEM-EDS analyses show that Zn element is unevenly distributed in Zn-TiO2 films; XRD patterns reveal that the grain size of Zn-TiO2 is smaller than that of pure-TiO2; FTIR results indicate that Zn-O bond forms on Zn-TiO2 surface. Ultraviolet visible absorption spectra prove that Zn-TiO2 shifts to visible light region. Mott-Shottky curves show that the flat-band potential of Zn-TiO2 is more negative and charge carrier density is bigger than that of pure-TiO2, implying that under the synergy of the width of the space-charge layer, carrier density and flat-band potential, Zn-TiO2 with 300 degrees C heat treatment displays the best photocathodic protection performance.

In this study, the experiment was designed in two factors and five levels random block design to investigate the interaction effects of Cs and K. Results showed that excessive Cs was one of the main factors influence the growth of Brassica juncea seedlings. And the toxicity of Cs in Brassica juncea is likely to be caused by Cs interacts with K binding sites in essential K-dependent protein, either competes with K for essential biochemical functions, causing intracellular metabolic disturbance. To test the hypothesis that the toxicity of Cs might cause intracellular metabolic disturbance, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based Illumina paired-end Solexa sequencing platform was employed to analysis the changes in gene expression, and understand the key genes in B. juncea seedlings responding to the toxicity of Cs. Based on the assembled de novo transcriptome, 2032 DEGs that play significant roles in the response to the toxicity of Cs were identified. Further analysis showed that excessive Cs is disturbance the auxin signal transduction pathway, and inhibited the indoleacetic acid-induced protein (AUX/IAA) genes expression eventually lead the seedlings growth and development be inhibited. The results suggest that disturbances to tryptophan metabolism might be linked to changes in growth. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

One method of fostering globalisation is to incorporate cross-national asynchronous online discussions with students from different countries within courses. The purpose of this study was to explore if participation by American and Chinese graduate students in cross-national online discussions facilitated construction of new knowledge regarding western and eastern cultures and provided effective international learning experiences. Data sources include students' transcripts and responses to open-ended survey questions on their perceptions regarding the online discussions. Results indicate that cross-national online discussions facilitated new knowledge regarding very different cultures. Further, this research offers a model that provides authentic international learning experiences where students explore meaningful concepts and relationships to address relevant problems in education.

It is found that the dynamical system can be perfectly analyzed by equivalently transforming it into a traditional first order linear dynamical system driven by periodic signal and additive noise in fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) domain with an optimal rotated angle, and the theoretical analysis and simulation results show that output SNR exhibits the SR behavior when it is plotted as a function of the system parameter.

Three stimuli were displayed sequentially and participants were asked to learn the target category based on the invariant feature among stimuli. The processes of invariance detection and variance inhibition were necessary during certain events; however, these processes were not required for other events. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) results indicated that the processes of detecting invariant features and inhibiting variant features were associated with significant activation in the left prefrontal cortex, including the left superior frontal gyrus, middle frontal gyrus, and mid-ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as other regions (e.g., bilateral parietal cortex and putamen). These findings confirmed the important role of the fronto-parietal network and striatum in the invariance detection of category learning. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tang, SH; Cao, XX; He, L; Zhu, WJ				Tang Shi-Hui; Cao Xiu-Xia; He Lin; Zhu Wen-Jun			Effects of vacancy point defects and phase transitions on optical properties of shocked Al2O3	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						high pressure; first-principles calculations; optical properties; sapphire	HIGH-PRESSURE PHASE; REFRACTIVE-INDEX; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; COMPRESSION; SAPPHIRE; CRYSTALS; ALUMINA; LAYER; LIF; GPA	The velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) and pyrometric measurements in dynamic high-pressure experiments require the use of an optical window, and Alumina (Al2O3) or sapphires is often considered as a window material due to its high shock impedance and excellent transparency. Consequently, understanding the characteristics of its transparency and refractive index change under shock loading is crucial for explaining such experimental data. Experimental studies indicate optical transparency loss in shocked Al2O3. The mechanisms for the phenomenon are some interesting issues. A first-principles study suggests that shock-induced V-O(+2) (the + 2 charged O vacancy) defects in Al2O3 could be an important factor causing the transparency loss. Recently, the red shift of the extinction curve (i.e., the wavelength dependence of the extinction coefficient) with increasing shock pressure has been observed. It is needed to ascertain whether this behavior is also related to shock-induced vacancy point defects. In addition, up to now, information about Al2O3 refractive index at a wavelength of 532 nm under strong shock compression (the optical source wavelength in VISAR measurement is usually set at 532 nm) has been unknown, and neither the effects of structural transitions nor vacancy point defects on the refractive index of shocked Al2O3 are determined. Here, to investigate the above-mentioned questions, we perform first principles calculations of optical absorption and refractive index properties of Al2O3 crystal without and with V-O(+2) and V-Al(-3) (the 3 charged Al vacancy) defects in a pressure range of 180 GPa (the calculations in CASTEP are carried out by the plane-wave pseudo potential method in the framework of the density functional theory). Our absorption data show that the observed optical extinction in shocked Al2O3 cannot be explained by only considering pressure and temperature factors, but shock-induced V-O(+2) should be an important source for this behavior. On the basis of these results, we may judge that 1) the transparency loss explanation for shocked Al2O3 in the view of vacancy point defects is reasonable; 2) the absorption extinction should dominate the extinction phenomenon observed in shocked Al2O3. Our calculations find that high-pressure structural transition in Al2O3 causes an obvious enhancement of its refractive index. The refractive index decreases with increasing shock pressure in corundum and Rh2O3 regions, and decreases slightly below 172 GPa and increases slowly above 172 GPa with increasing shock pressure in CalrO(3) region. The V-O(+2) and V-Al(-3) defects in Al2O3 have apparent influences on the shock pressure dependence of its refractive index. These results mean that the information about Al2O3 refractive index under strong shock loading cannot be obtained simply by extrapolating its low pressure data. Our prediction could be of importance for future experimental study and new window-material development.

Accordingly, a new ground-state crystal structure WB2 (P6(3)/mmc, 2 fu/cell) is uncovered. The experimental synthesized rhombohedral R (3) over barm and hexagonal AlB2, as well as theoretical predicted RuB2 structures, are no longer the most favorite structures. By analyzing the elastic constants, formation enthalpies, and phonon dispersion, we find that the WB2 phase is 20 thermodynamically and mechanically stable. The high bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, low Poisson's ratio v, and small B/G ratio are benefit to its low compressibility. When the pressure is 10 GPa, a phase transition is observed between the A WB2-MoB2 and the rhombohedral R (3) over barm MoB2 phases. By analyzing the density of states and electron density, we find that the strong, covalent is formed in MOB2 compounds, which contributes a great deal to its low compressibility. Furthermore, the low compressibility is also correlated with the local buckled structure.

The lattice parameters, Poisson's ratio and B/G ratio are also derived. Our calculations indicate that the orthorhombic structure with Pnnm symmetry is the most energetically stable one for CrB4. Except for WB(4)P6(3)/mmc structure with imaginary frequencies, another six new structures are investigated through the full phonon dispersion calculations. Their mechanical and thermodynamic stabilities are also studied by calculating the elastic constants and formation enthalpies. Our calculations show that the thermodynamic stabilities of all these CrB4 phases can be enhanced under high pressure. The large shear moduli, Young's moduli and hardness values indicate that these CrB4 phases are potential hard materials. Analyses of the densities of states (DOSS) and electron localization functions (ELFs) provide further understandings of the chemical and physical properties of these CrB4 phases. It is observed that the large occupations and high strengths of the B-B covalent bonds are important for the stabilities, incompressibility and hardnesses of these CrB4 phases.

In this work, we successfully converted commercial cotton threads (CT) into electrically conductive and electrochemically active threads by introducing reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanoparticles (CNPs) using a large-scale producible method (dip-coating combined with low-temperature vapour reduction). The rGO coated CT (rGO-CT) has impressive conductivity which is attributed to the wrapped rGO nanosheets and it is steady enough to tolerate washing process for a long time. After coated with CNPs, the conductivity of CNPs/rGO composites coated CT (CNPs/rGO-CT) has been enhanced tremendously. Meanwhile, the rGO nanosheets with implanted CNPs form the three-dimensional (3D) hierarchical nanostructures which provide abundant ion transmission channels. Furthermore, we have prepared the CNPs/rGO-CT based FSC, which exhibits high volumetric capacitance (3.79 mF cm(-3) at 50 mV s(-1)), well cycling stability (95.23% capacitance retention after 10000 charge-discharge cycles), and excellent electrochemical stability (92.30% capacitance retention after 2000 bending cycles). Especially, the CNPs/rGO-CT based FSC maintains great capacitive performance when it was knitted into textile, thus making it meet the high performance requirements of energy storage devices for knittable and wearable electronics.

An accurate investigation into this modulation mechanism would reveal how STIM1-dependent channel gating is enhanced, and benefit the future immune enhancer development. Here, we directly probed the pore diameter of CRAC channels and found that 2-APB enlarged the pore size of STIM1-activated Orai1 from 3.8 to 4.6 angstrom. We demonstrated that ions with small sizes, i.e., Ca2+ and Na+, mediated prominent 2-APB-induced I-p on the wildtype (WT) Orai1 channels of narrow pore sizes, while conducted decreased or no I-p on Orai1-V102C/A/G mutant channels with enlarged pore diameters. On the contrary, large Cs+ ions blocked the WT channels, while displayed large 2-APB induced I-p on poreenlarged Orai1-V102C/A/G mutant channels, and the potentiation ratio was highest on Orai1-V102C with an intermediate pore size. Furthermore, we showed that 2-APB potentiated Cs+ current on constitutively active Orai1-V102C/A/G mutants independent of STIM1. Our data suggest that 2-APB directly dilates the pore of open Orai1 channels, both ion size and pore diameter jointly determine the amplitude of I-p on CRAC channels, and the generation of I-p requires the open state of Orai1, not STIM1 itself.

Five model anti-cancer drugs were chosen to evaluate the drug selection, drug loading and releasing performance of carbon nanoparticle suspension. The relative recovery, precision, stability and limited detection range were studied in details. We found that the CNSI selectively adsorbed DOX and EPI and hardly adsorbed PTX, CDDP and 5-FU. The isothermal curves of CNSI adsorption to DOX and EPI are all fitted well with the Freundlich model. The adsorption process is not monolayer adsorption. By in vivo topical administration of DOX-loaded CNSI and EPI-loaded CNSI, we found that the drug-loaded CNSI were not only maintained its lymph node staining properties but also targeted delivery the drugs to the lymph node. The results demonstrated that the CNSI is not only used to vital staining of lymph vessels and lymph nodes but also can be used as drug delivery carrier. CNSI is a promising theranostic carrier for DOX or EPI delivery in cancer therapy.

The calculated formation energies show that the single Te energetically prefers to substitute the core Ga (E-f = 0.4111 eV) under As-rich conditions of GaAs nanowires, while on surface, the single Te tends to substitute the surface As site. With increasing the Te concentration, the favorable substitution sites are 2Te-Ga-A and 3Te-Ga-D. Thus, the stability of the structure of the electronic structure and optical properties are discussed.

The effects of spin-orbit coupling and rotation on the ground state vortex structures are investigated. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling, new nucleated vortices gradually form vortex lines and annular vortex structures with the increase of the rotation frequency. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, part of the vortices arrange in a line and form a stable vortex chain, and the remanent vortices coexist in pairs aside such vortex chain. More specially, the remanent vortices of each component repel each other and form vortex pair for isotropic spin-orbit coupling, while attract each other and locate in the same positions for anisotropic spin-orbit coupling.

The effects of different volatile allelochemicals (volatile oil, cymene and alpha-terpinene) from C. ambrosioides were examined to see their effect on the root length, reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels/localization, malondialdehyde (MDA) content and antioxidant enzyme activities in maize radicles. All these allelochemicals inhibited the growth of maize radicles, increased the MDA and ROS contents in tip cells of the root cap and meristem. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), peroxidase (POD) and catalase (CAT) were reduced. The volatile oil of C. ambrosioides and its two main components inhibited the growth of maize radical by inducing oxidative stress through the enhanced generation of ROS, accompanied by increased lipid peroxidation and inactivation of antioxidant enzyme system.

The Ethical Judgment and Moral Reaction to the Product-Harm Crisis: Theoretical Model and Empirical Research	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						product-harm crisis; ethical judgment; condemning emotion; purchasing intention; negative word of mouth; product knowledge	CONSUMER RESPONSE; MODERATING ROLE; IMPACT; EMOTIONS; ATTRIBUTIONS; BEHAVIOR; EXPRESSION; ANGER	Based on the dual-process theory of ethical judgment, a research model is proposed for examining consumers' moral reactions to a product-harm crisis. A national-wide survey was conducted with 801 respondents in China. The results of this study indicate that consumers will react to a product-harm crisis through controlled cognitive processing and emotional intuition. The results of the study also show that consumers view a product-harm crisis as an ethical issue, and they will make an ethical judgment according to the perceived severity and perceived relevance of the crisis. The ethical judgment in the perceived crisis severity and perceived crisis relevance will affect consumers' condemning emotions in terms of contempt and anger. Through controlled cognitive processing, a personal consumption-related reaction (purchasing intention) is influenced by the perceived crisis severity. Furthermore, a social and interpersonal reaction (negative word of mouth) is influenced by the perceived crisis relevance through the controlled cognitive processing. This social and interpersonal reaction is also influenced by the perceived crisis severity and perceived crisis relevance through the intuition of other-condemning emotion. Moreover, this study finds that the product knowledge negatively moderates the impact of the perceived crisis severity on the condemning emotions. Therefore, when a consumer has a high level of product knowledge, the effect of perceived crisis severity on the condemning emotions will be attenuated, and vice versa. This study provides scholars and managers with means of understanding and handling of consumers' reactions to a product-harm crisis.

It is a coupled system which describes the spontaneous generation of a magnetic field in a cold plasma under the static limit. The main difficulty in the proofs lies in exploring the inner structure of the equations due to the fact that the nonlocal terms violate the inner scaling invariance, which may cause the non-zero energy for the ground state. For this reason, we first make a proper use of the inner structure of the equations to establish the existence of standing waves, and then we apply an energy scaling to obtain the instability of standing waves. Finally we show a sharp threshold for the global existence of solutions to the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equations by a variational method, which depends again on the inner structure of the equations under consideration.

The calculated equilibrium lattice parameters and formation enthalpy are in good agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. The calculated results indicate that the V-Si compounds are mechanically stable. Elastic properties including bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio are also obtained. The elastic anisotropies of V-Si compounds are investigated via the three-dimensional (3D) figures of directional dependences of reciprocals of Young's modulus. Finally, based on the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the internal energy, Helmholtz free energy, entropy, heat capacity, thermal expansion coefficient, Gruneisen parameter, and Debye temperature of V-Si compounds have been calculated.

The microstructures and luminescence properties of the as-synthesized microcrystals were characterized through X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy. Moreover, the photoluminescent properties of Eu3+-doped beta-NaGdF4 samples synthesized at different pH values were systematically discussed. As a result, monodisperse and uniform spherical and rod-like crystals were successfully synthesized by varying Ln(3+)/NaF molar ratio, Ln(3+)/Na(3)Cit molar ratio and pH value, and the obtained feasible range of pH value is 8-11, the optimal molar ratios of Ln(3+)/NaF and Ln(3+)/Na(3)Cit are 1:6 and 1:3, respectively. Our results show that there is an energy transfer process between the host and activator ions, emissions from high energy configurations to ground state are gradually quenched in the beta-NaGdF4: Eu3+ phosphors obtained in the strong alkaline solution. In addition, pure orange-red photoluminescent color can be obtained from beta-NaGdF4: 2 mol% Eu3+ phosphors synthesized under the obtained processing conditions. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, we used real-time qPCR to investigate the abundance of bacteria, archaea, ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB), and the amoA gene transcripts, during the decomposition of dwarf bamboo (Fargesia nitida) litter under different snow patches at various snow-cover stages in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau in China. The effects of snow thickness were significant, with thicker snow patches resulting in higher microbial abundance and the amoA gene transcripts, while the degree of the effects were different. Compared with AOB, AOA were more abundant on the majority of sampling dates during the freeze-thaw period, and as well as their amoA gene transcripts. AOA are more persistent and abundant than AOB, and the higher AOA/AOB ratios were observed clearly in shrub litter and continued to decrease as the snow thickness increased, meanwhile gradually increased under uniform snow thickness over time. Our results suggested that the reduced seasonal snow cover and shortened freeze-thaw cycle periods caused by winter warming would significantly affect the ammonia oxidizers particularly tied to the ammonia oxidation process, and then could contribute to N cycle as related to litter in alpine forest ecosystems.

Compared with BOTDA assisted by first-order DBA, the proposed approach enhanced the signal-to-noise ratio of the Brillouin trace by similar to 3 dB for a range featuring minimum sensing intensity. Long-distance sensing with similar to 5 m spatial resolution and similar to 1.6 degrees C measurement uncertainty over similar to 99 km fiber was successfully realized by employing high-efficiency pumping using similar to 6 dBm second-order and similar to 1.5 dBm first-order pumps.

It is found that a fully coherent beam is more strongly compressed on the ground than a partially (spatial) coherent beam (PCB), even so, for a PCB the compressed spot size on the ground may be reduced below the diffraction limit due to self-focusing effect, and a PCB has higher threshold critical power than a fully coherent beam. Furthermore, an effective design rule for maximal compression without beam splitting of the transported PCB from orbit to the ground is presented.

By using renewal process theory and total probability decomposition technique, the authors study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursive expression of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursive formula for calculating the steady state queue length at arbitrary time epoch n(+). Meanwhile, the authors obtain the explicit expressions of the additional queue length distribution. Furthermore, the important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs n(-), n and n(+) are also reported. Finally, the authors give numerical examples to illustrate the effect of system parameters on the steady state queue length distribution, and also show from numerical results that the expressions of the steady state queue length distribution is important in the system capacity design.

All the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure with rhombohedral symmetry. The grain growth of the ceramics is inhibited after the addition of Nb doping. High electric insulation (R = 10(9)-10(10) Omega a <...cm) and the poor piezoelectric performance and weak ferroelectricity are observed after the addition of Nb2O5 in the ceramics. Different from the donor effect of Pb-based perovskite ceramics, the introduction of Nb into 0.7BiFeO(3)-0.3BaTiO(3) degrades the piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The Bi0.7Ba0.3(Fe0.7Ti0.3)(1-x) Nb-0.66x O-3 + 1 mol% MnO2 ceramic with x = 0 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties with d (33) = 133 pN C-1 and k (p) = 0.29 and high Curie temperature (T-C = 603(a similar to)C).

Litter decomposition in terrestrial lotic ecosystem is one of the most important pathways for metallic elements cycling, while little information is currently available about the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems. The concentrations and release rates of potassium (K), calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and aluminium (Al) were investigated in the decomposing foliar litter of four dominant species in an alpine forest river. Over a 1-year period of decomposition, K, Ca, and Mg were released from virtually all types of litter, whereas Na, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and Al were released from willow litter but accumulated in azalea, cypress, and larch litters during litter decomposition. Litter species, decomposition period, and river water characteristics (e.g., temperature, pH, flow velocity, and nutrient availability) were significantly related to the dynamics of these metallic elements in decomposing litter. Our results suggested that the similarity between the dynamics of metallic elements in the decomposing litter of lotic ecosystems reported here and previously for forest floors indicates a general pattern for the cycling of metallic element across different ecosystem types, and the net accumulation patterns for elements such as Zn, Cu, and Al during litter decomposition suggested that some litter species may act as efficient "cleaner" for metal purification in future ecological engineering.

Complete characterization is established for the subdifferential of the minimal time function satisfying the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation.

However, aryl triflate derivatives have been less used despite their high chemical tolerance, reactivity, and chemical accessibility. In this report, three series of discogens have been synthesized in good yields from appropriate triphenylene triflate precursors by Suzuki coupling reactions with various commercial arylboronic acids (e.g., aryl = phenylene, thiophene, naphthalene, triarylamine, carbazole, and fluorene). The synthesized discogens display broad mesophase ranges and high thermal stabilities. Moreover, those bearing triarylamine, carbazole, and fluorene side groups are also blue-light emitters. The availability of the triflate precursors coupled with their highly efficient cross-coupling with commercial arylboronic acids make this strategy extremely versatile and attractive for the design of new functional materials.

It is found that the stability of symmetric DTMs is dominated by the radial pressure force rather than the field line bending force. Owing to the compressibility of rotating plasmas, unbalanced radial forces can just result in the rotating islands drift toward each other in the radial direction but do not trigger the explosive growth of the mode in the interlocking process, which is different from that of antisymmetric DTM without flow.

J	Wu, SG; Feng, D				Wu Shao-Gui; Feng Dan			Free Energy Calculation for Base Pair Dissociation in a DNA Duplex	ACTA PHYSICO-CHIMICA SINICA			English	Article						Potential of mean force; Hydrogen bond; Molecular dynamics simulation; Umbrella sampling	MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS; PARTICLE MESH EWALD; NUCLEIC-ACIDS; FORCE-FIELD; RNA; TRIPHOSPHATE; MECHANICS; GROMACS	DNA is the main genetic material for living organisms including many viruses. DNA duplex, coded with A=T and G=C base pairs, is well suited for biological information storage. The interactions between two bases in a base pair contribute to the stability of DNA duplex, and are further related to gene replication and transcription. In this study, we use all-atom Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations combined with Umbrella sampling (US) method to determine the free energy profiles and explore the molecular details for base pair dissociations. Four groups of DNA duplexes with different sequences have been constructed and a total of 4.3 mu s MD simulations have been carried out. In the potential of mean force (PMF) profile for G equivalent to C base pair dissociation (denoted as PMF-PGC), we observed three peaks, which correspond to the three moments G equivalent to C base pair loses its three hydrogen bonds respectively. Differently, A=T base pair loses its two hydrogen bonds within a very short time. As a result, only one hydrogen bond rupture peak was observed in its PMF curve (denoted as PMF-PAT). Compared with PMF-PAT, the overall free energy barrier in PMF-PGC is higher, which is due to the better stability of G equivalent to C than A=T. In the latter sections of both PMFs, free energies are still increasing, which is mainly resulted from the rigidity of DNA duplex backbone. We have also investigated the impact of neighboring base pairs on the stability of middle one. It is found that neighboring G equivalent to C base pairs increase the stability of A=T base pair while neighboring C equivalent to G base pairs reduce the stability of A=T base pair. Additionally, neighboring T=A base pairs have little influence on the stability of A=T base pair.

Based on regular Torus topology, NovaCube is constructed by adding a number of most beneficial jump-over links, which offers many distinct advantages and practical benefits. Moreover, in order to enable NovaCube to achieve its maximum theoretical performance, a probabilistic oblivious routing algorithm PORA is carefully designed. PORA is a both deadlock and livelock free routing algorithm, which achieves near-optimal performance in terms of average routing path length with better load balancing thus leading to higher throughput. Theoretical derivation and mathematical analysis together with extensive simulations further prove the good performance of NovaCube and PORA. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

This structure can avoid the stability problem caused by laser frequency drift. In addition, we used an optical comb technique to suppress the distortion of pump pulse. Moreover, the feasibility of an optical pulse coding technology in this system was studied. In particular, we explored the influence of coding parameters on the transient gain saturation of the coded pulse. Results show that the coded pulse space and coding length must be optimized to suppress its transient gain saturation, by which the sensing with lower decoding error can be achieved.

In this study we evaluated 20 synthesized phenanthrene analogs in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW264.7 macrophages. Compounds 10, 11 and 17 were found to inhibit the production of nitric oxide (NO) with IC50 values of 37.26 mu M, 5.05 mu M and 20.31 mu M, respectively. Compound 11 decreased LPS-induced expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), inhibited phosphorylation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and serine/threonine kinase Akt. It also suppressed the phosphorylation and degradation of inhibitory kappa B-alpha (I kappa B alpha). Data obtained suggest that compound 11 exerts anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting p38 MAPK and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B) pathways, which warrants further investigation as a new anti-inflammatory pharmaceutical tool.

Using a temporal moments approach and combining with this new formula for the MCF, the analytical expression for the pulse width is deduced. Besides, the quantity of Rytov variance sigma(2)(R) in oceanic turbulence is obtained, which is widely used as a measure of the strength of turbulence. In particular, the on-axis relative pulse broadening and turbulent effective coefficient of ultra-short pulses (i.e., femtosecond-picosecond regime) propagating through oceanic turbulence are investigated.

However, its global transcriptomic response remains largely unrevealed. In this study, M. smegmatis MC2 155 cultivated in androstenedione, cholesterol and glycerol supplemented media were collected separately for a RNA-Sequencing study. The results showed that 6004, 6681 and 6348 genes were expressed in androstenedione, cholesterol and glycerol supplemented media, and 5891 genes were expressed in all three conditions, with 237 specially expressed in cholesterol added medium. A total of 1852 and 454 genes were significantly up-regulated by cholesterol compared with the other two supplements. Only occasional changes were observed in basic carbon and nitrogen metabolism, while almost all of the genes involved in cholesterol catabolism and mammalian cell entry (MCE) were up-regulated by cholesterol, but not by androstenedione. Eleven and 16 gene clusters were induced by cholesterol when compared with glycerol or androstenedione, respectively. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the cholesterol responsive transcriptome of M. smegmatis. Our results indicated that cholesterol induced many more genes and increased the expression of the majority of genes involved in cholesterol degradation and MCE in M. smegmatis, while androstenedione did not have the same effect.

In this paper, crowd simulation is considered from two aspects: intra-group simulation and inter-group simulation. We propose a unified framework for crowd simulation in real-time virtual environment. Based on this framework, for intra-group simulation, we propose a novel density-based information crowd simulation to collision-free. For inter-group simulation, we propose a novel discrete choice (DC) model to realistic simulation of crowds and path planning. Meanwhile, we also propose a variable bounding box method for intra-group/inter-groups intersection problem. The simulation results show that the developed framework allows different group structures to be easily modeled. And the proposed framework could be used for real-time navigation of many moving crowd in complicated virtual environments.

Yulei1 suspension culture system for enhanced production of the main secondary metabolite, chlorogenic acid. Methods: The callus of L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. "Yulei1" was suspension cultured in B5 liquid medium supplemented with different plant growth regulators. Biomass accumulation was calculated by weight method and chlorogenic acid production was measured using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). HPLC was carried out on C18 analytical column at 35 degrees C and the detection wavelength was set at 324 nm. Results: The results showed that maximum accumulation of biomass and chlorogenic acid were achieved 15 days after culture growth. The optimized conditions for biomass accumulation and chlorogenic acid production were 50 g/L of inoculum on fresh weight basis, B5 medium supplemented with plant growth regulators, 30 - 40 g/L sucrose and initial medium pH of 5.5. Maximum accumulation of chlorogenic acid and biomass were observed when the culture medium was supplemented with 2.0 mg/L6-BA. Optimal accumulation of chlorogenic acid was observed using combination of hormones 2.0 mg/L 6-Benzyladenine (BA) + 0.5 mg/L2, 4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), while optimal accumulation of biomass was observed with 2.0 mg/L 6-BA + 2.0 mg/L2, 4-D. In addition, phenylalanine also contributed to the synthesis of chlorogenic acid at a concentration > 50 mg/L. Conclusion: Cell suspension cultures of L. macranthoides Hand.-Mazz. "Yulei1" have successfully been established. The findings provide a potential basis for large scale production of chlorogenic acid using cell suspension cultures of L. macranthoides.

We first put forward a protocol for implementing four-party bidirectional states sharing (BQSS) by using eight-qubit cluster state as quantum channel. In order to extend BQSS, we generalize this protocol from four sharers to multi-sharers utilizing two multi-qubit GHZ-type states as channel, and propose two multi-party BQSS schemes. On the other hand, we generalize the three schemes from two senders to multi-senders with multi GHZ-type states of multi-qubit as quantum channel, and give a multidirectional quantum states sharing protocol. In our schemes, all receivers can reconstruct the original unknown single-qubit state if and only if all sharers can cooperate. Only Pauli operations, Bell-state measurement and single-qubit measurement are used in our schemes, so these schemes are easily realized in physical experiment and their successful probabilities are all one.

The HSP90 beta cDNA of B. reevesae contained 2358 bp, including a 1947 bp open reading frame, a 36 bp 5'-untranslated region (UTR), a 375 bp 3'-UTR. Sequence comparisons indicated that the predicted amino acid sequence of B. reevesae HSP90 showed a high degree of similarity with other known HSP90 beta genes, and contained five HSP superfamily signatures, thus suggesting that B. reevesae HSP90 beta is a cytosolic member of the HSP90 family. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis revealed that HSP90 transcripts could be detected in all of the tissues tested, and was strongly expressed in liver, gill and kidney tissues (p<0.05) of B. reevesae after sublethal ammonia-N exposure and Aeromonas hydrophila challenge. Additionally, following sublethal ammonia-N exposure and A. hydrophila challenge, expression of HSP90 beta mRNA transcripts was increased in gill and kidney tissues by 6-24 h (p<0.05), and was more reduced in the liver than the levels observed in response to ammonia-N exposure or A. hydrophila challenge alone. This result indicated that after ammonia-N stress, B. reevesae could trigger elevated HSP90 beta expression in specific tissues to respond to pathogenic bacteria. C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The radial distribution function, dielectric constant, polarizability, dielectric relaxation time, hydrogen bonding and diffusion coefficient were investigated. Significant alteration in the static electric field has effect on the tetrahedral structure of water; the interaction between microwave and water depends on the hydrogen bonding. The 3 x 10(7) V/m is threshold intensity, as the intensity of the static electric field increases the decline of the dielectric constant becomes more pronounced, and the polarizability obviously increased with the increase of microwave field. And the life of hydrogen bonding is oscillatory under the high static electric field strength. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

FM, NM, I and SF represent the ferromagnetic metal, nonmagnetic metal, insulator and spin-filter barrier, respectively. Our results show that due to the spin filtering effect in SF potential barriers, the FM/I/SF/NM can obtain relatively stabilized TMR in higher bias region when it has higher potential height and thicker SF barrier. And, for obtaining large TMR, the total thickness of the barrier region would be carefully selected as the influence of the supplementary I layer. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Tunable optomechanically induced transparency in double quadratically coupled optomechanical cavities within a common reservoir	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; QUANTUM GROUND-STATE; SLOW LIGHT; OSCILLATOR	We consider the optomechanically induced transparency in the double quadratically coupled optomechanical cavities within a common reservoir, in which the two cavities are driven by the coupling fields. It is shown that the probe transparency is improved by increasing the coupling field (the left coupling field) applied on the probing cavity, but the transparency position (the probe frequency of the maximal transparency) is shifted to high frequency. The coupling field (the right coupling field) applied on the other quadratically coupled cavity can lead to a low-frequency shift for the transparency position, which can be used to fix the transparency position by adjusting the right coupling field. We get the quantitative findings that the transparency position is exactly determined by the intensity difference between the two coupling fields. On the other hand, it is found that when the two coupled optomechanical cavities interact with their common reservoir, the cross decay induced by the common reservoir can improve the probe transparency and widen the transparency window. Finally, the effects of the environment's temperature on the transparency are investigated. This will be useful in cooling the membrane, squeezing and entangling the output fields.	[Bai, C.; Hou, B.

Effects of the Land Use Change on Ecosystem Service Value in Chengdu, Western China from 1978 to 2010	JOURNAL OF THE INDIAN SOCIETY OF REMOTE SENSING			English	Article						Ecosystem service value (ESV); Land use changes; Sensitivity of ESV; Variable ratio function of ESV; Flows of ESV; Remote sensing (RS)	SOIL ORGANIC-CARBON; URBANIZATION; LANDSCAPES; GROWTH; SINKS	Analysis of the ecosystem service value (ESV) associated with the observed land use changes is critically important for environmental assessment and sustainable urban development. This research evaluate the effects of land use on ESV in Chengdu based on remotely sensed data and GIS, assessment model, transfer and flows model, sensitivity and variable ratio function. The results show that the ESV is mainly composed of forest land and cultivated land. ESV substantially and continuously decreased by 92 x 10(8) Chinese Yuan (CNY) or about 45 % in Chengdu during the study period and ESV from urban areas in the city center and its surroundings were much lower than those from the natural landscape in the northern and western Longmenshan mountainous region. Land use changes were the major causes of the observed transfer and flows in ESV. The flows of ESV both positive and negative were associated with observed land use changes, but overall land use changes had a negative impact on ESV. The results further indicate that the coefficient change relative to the ESV was inelastic, and the relative sensitivity index was as follows: forest land > cultivated land > water areas, but changes in water area had the largest influence and amplification effect on the ESV. This research offers important insights for use in planning fast urbanizing regions and can assist to achieve more sustainable land use and policy making.

Jatropha seed cake (JSC) was one by-product generated after the biodiesel industry. The solid-state fermentation (SSF) of the zxy-12 strain was exploited for the detoxification of JSC as a growth substrate. The zxy-12 strain showed a high degradation efficiency of phorbol esters (PEs) or derivatives and curcin. The SSF parameters were optimized for the maximum degradation of PEs or derivatives. The quantitative analysis of PEs or derivatives was established by the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method. PEs or derivatives in JSC were well separated to seven individual peaks, that was similar to the HPLC chart of Jatropha curcas fractions (JCF). Under the optimized conditions, the maximum removal of PEs or derivatives was obtained at the ratio of 92.78% (w w(-1)) as the main toxicant in JSC. In fermented JSC, the crude fat was significantly reduced by 5.53%. Crude proteins and small peptides were greatly increased by 15.11% and 19.61%, respectively, and exceeded soybean meal by 6.2% and 9.93%, respectively. The amino acid composition also significantly increased. Our results suggested that SSF by the zxy-12 strain was a viable detoxification approach to utilize the huge amount of JSC.

The simulated dielectric constant results from the fluctuation method (693) and electric field method (70.12) are in quantitative agreement with the experiment result (64.5). The radial distribution function and coordination structure of Li+ and OH- ions of LiOH aqueous solution change significantly with the intensity of the external E/M fields in the range of 0 and 3 x 10(9) V/m. At the high E/M fields (3 x 10(9) V/m), the interactions of the Li+ and OH- ions with water in first hydration shell are weakening due to the acceleration rotational effect of ions driven by the external E/M fields. The rearrangement and interactions of water molecules around Li+ and OH- ions in hydration shell may be affected by the external E/M fields applied. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The upstream and downstream carriers consist of a set of wavelength division multiplexed chaotic signals, and each wavelength takes on several bidirectional optical line terminal (OLT)-optical network unit (ONU) transmissions in virtue of the subcarrier modulation multiplexing technology. The numerical results demonstrate that with proper selection of the wavelength spacing, high-quality chaos synchronization can be achieved on each wavelength, and each wavelength can afford several OLT-ONU transmissions by properly allocating the frequency spacing of subcarriers. The proposed scheme can improve the bandwidth utilization efficiency and obviously enhance the information security at the physical layer of the WDM-PON.

The mixture behavior is described in terms of the Havriliak-Negami and two Debye type relaxation models whose evolution with temperature is analyzed. A distinct antiparallel arrangement of dipoles is obtained for urea in the aqueous solution, according to the Kirkwood correlation factor, calculated from the static permittivity. We have also analyzed enthalpy, entropy and the activation energy of molecular reorientation of aqueous urea solution, and analyzed the formation of dimers about urea and water using the density functional theory.

In 4S auto maintenance shop, it may appear temporary bottlenecks except for the long-term bottlenecks, and they form multi-constraint machines jointly with the task size reaching the peak. Through scheduling the constraint machines effectively, it can improve overall performance of the system to satisfy the customers' requirements. First, we describe and construct a model for the scheduling problem which can be designed as the dynamic flexible job shop scheduling problem (FJSP) with multi-constraint machines for the goal of minimizing customers' waiting time. Then, putting an emphasis on the constraint machines, we apply the theory of constraint to decompose and simplify the complex system and also construct the coordination mechanism between constraint machines and non-constraint machines. After that, an improved constraint-guided heuristic algorithm is proposed to solve the constraint machine scheduling problem, while different dispatching rules are selected for solving the non-constraint machine scheduling according to the location of the non-bottleneck in the system. What is more, we design the rescheduling rules combing characteristics of the problem to realize dynamic scheduling with multi-constraint machines. Finally, 4S auto maintenance shop scheduling with high workload during the rush hour (on the eve of the holiday) served as the actual cases, and the proposed algorithm is compared with three different dispatching rules under various size of problems. The result obtained from the computational study has shown that the proposed algorithm is much better.

Three schemes are presented. Our schemes employ the maximal slice states as quantum channel, which consists of the tripartite entangled state from the first party(Alice), the second party(Bob), the third party(Cliff). The supervisor(Cliff) can supervises and controls the channel between Alice and Bob via measurement. Through carrying out local von Neumann measurement, controlled-NOT operation and positive operator-valued measure(POVM), and introducing an auxiliary particle, we can obtain the success probability of dense coding. It is shown that the success probability of information transmitted from Alice to Bob is usually less than one. The average amount of information for each scheme is calculated in detail. These results offer deeper insight into quantum dense coding via quantum channels of partially entangled states.

The novel SACDCR is formed by one superconducting air-core solenoidal inductor unit and one series-connected superconducting noninductive solenoidal resistor unit. The air gaps between the terminal layers of the superconducting air-core solenoid are optimized to achieve a higher critical current based on anisotropic traits and magnetic field distributions. The superconducting noninductive solenoid, which is inserted into the inner center of the superconducting air-core solenoid, experiences an increased background field under the fault condition and thus achieves better fault current limiting features compared with the same type of superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) without a background field.

In this study, Brassica juncea and Vicia faba were subjected to varying doses of Cs for 21 days to investigate the differences in bio-accumulations, subcellular distribution and chemical forms of Cs in two cultivars by differential centrifugation, and extraction of Cs in different chemical forms, respectively. The results showed that 49.87%-61.08% of the Cs were in the leaf of B. juncea, while in V. faba,1.58%-79.29% of the Cs was in the root. The translocation factor (TF) arrived 2.79 to 3.71 in B. juncea, while it only reached 0.26 to 0.62 in V faba. Cs subcellular distribution of the two plants was in sequence as follows: soluble fraction > cell wall >> organelles. Cs was more easily distributed to metal-sensitive fractions of V. faba. The inorganic Cs (F-ethanol), and water-soluble Cs (F-dH(2)O) are the main existing types of Cs in the two plants. In B. juncea, the relative content of inorganic Cs, and organic acids/CsH2PO4 (F-dH(2)O) were higher than that of V faba in the stem. This suggests that Cs may induce related transporter gene expression (such as phosphate transporter, organic cation, high affinity nitrate transporter, amino acid permease, etc.) to help the transport of Cs between root to shoot.

Such analyses are pointing to the existence of many cryptic species, especially in poorly understood groups such as the genus Limnonectes, and the L. kuhlii species complex in particular. To understand the Limnonectes frogs of China, we reconstruct the major matrilineal genealogy of Limnonectes from China and Southeast Asia based on 12S rRNA, tRNA(Val) and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Based on new data we recognize five species of Limnonectes in China including L. bannaensis, L. fujianensis, L. fragilis, L. taylori ( new record), and a new species from southern China and Myanmar. Phylogenetically, the new species is more closely related to the clade comprising L. taylori, L. megastomias, L. isanensis, L. nguyenorum, and L. jarujini from Thailand than to other Chinese species. This study supports previous findings of sympatric members of a species complex that are not each other's closest relatives.

J	Zhang, XY; Miao, DQ				Zhang, Xianyong; Miao, Duoqian			Quantitative/qualitative region-change uncertainty/certainty in attribute reduction: Comparative region-change analyses based on granular computing	INFORMATION SCIENCES			English	Article						Rough set theory; Granular computing; Attribute reduction; Uncertainty; Probabilistic rough set; Decision-theoretic rough set	THEORETIC ROUGH SETS; 3-WAY DECISIONS; FUZZY; MODEL; PRECISION; APPROXIMATIONS; MAINTENANCE; FUSION; SPACE	Attribute reduction is a fundamental research theme in rough 'sets and granular computing (GrC). Its scientific construction originally depends on the region-change law. At present, only region-change non-monotonicity/monotonicity is mined in the quantitative/qualitative model. The in-depth region-change truth and its GrC mechanism have significance, especially for follow-up attribute reduction. This paper commences probing region-change essence, mainly from a novel uncertainty/certainty viewpoint. Concretely, we make comparative region-change analyses based on GrC, by resorting to the qualitative Pawlak-Model and quantitative DTRS-Model (the decision-theoretic rough set model). (1) Knowledge-coarsening is investigated to describe attribute deletion. (2) Granule-merging and its region-distribution are studied to probe region-change functions. (3) Region-change is analyzed in Pawlak-Model to mine qualitative region-change certainty and its relevant properties. (4) Region-change is analyzed in DTRS-Model to mine quantitative region-change uncertainty and its relevant properties. (5) Comparative region-change analyses are summarized, and further experiment verification is provided. Knowledge-coarsening and granule-merging establish GrC mechanisms for extensive region-change analyses. Quantitative/qualitative region-change uncertainty/certainty and relevant principles are discovered via DTRS-Model/Pawlak-Model. By virtue of the GrC technology and comparative strategy, this study reveals region-change uncertainty/certainty to deepen region-change non-monotonicity/monotonicity; furthermore, it underlies attribute reduction, especially with regard to quantitative models.

The system behaviour is described according to the Cole-Cole and two Debye-type relaxation functions whose evolution with composition is analysed. Combining the Cole-Cole and two Debye-type relaxation functions, the results of the dielectric properties of aqueous LiCl solution are presented and discussed. The maximum number of water molecules perturbed by ions in the hydration shell decays with its concentration. Using the extended Froehlich theory, it is concluded that the water structure is perturbed by ions beyond the first hydration shell in LiCl aqueous solution system.

We reveal the single nature of urea- water cooperative interaction and draw a profile of the overview that urea- water cooperative interaction plays a dominating role in the aqueous urea solution system using Cole- Cole analysis. The self- diffusion coefficient is related to the concentration of the urea aqueous solution. The decay of the effective number of water molecules bound to the urea molecules with its concentration and the urea perturb the water structure beyond the first hydration shell, which is confirmed in the aqueous urea solution system. And the relation between tau and a may be utilised widely to measure the urea concentration for a microwave biosensor technique.

We used scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy to study the floral development of Urophysa rockii Ulbrich, a recently rediscovered species in this genus. The sepals are initiated spirally, whereas other organs are nonsimultaneously whorled; the floral phyllotaxis is whorled. Primordia of the sepals are lunular and truncate, but those of the petals and stamens are hemispherical and rounded. After sepal initiation, there is a delay in development, but the initiation of petals and stamens is continuous. The developmental sequence of the microspores in the stamens is centrifugal, although the stamens are initiated centripetally. The early developmental stages of the staminodes are similar to those of the stamens, although much smaller, so they may be phylogenetically homologous organs. The carpel primordia are lunular in shape and plicate. The mature ovule is anatropous and bitegmic. Urophysa shows similar floral development features as Aquilegia and Semiaquilegia, although with some differences, which supports the relationship inferred by DNA sequence data.

The geometries and the frequencies of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products have been calculated at the B3LYP/6-31+G(d, p) level, dichloroethane (DCE) is used as a solvent and the LanL2DZ basis has been used for In atom. Transition states have been confirmed by the corresponding vibration analysis and intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC). In addition, nature bond orbital (NBO) and atoms in molecules (AIM) theories have been used to analyze orbital interactions and bond natures. The results showed that the activation energies of rate-determining steps in which N-methylindole reacted with keto ester to form 1,2-adduct and 1,4-adduct were 25.62 and 12.52 kcal/mol catalyzed by InF3 while those were 26.87 and 13.95 kcal/mol when the reaction was catalyzed by InBr3 under the same conditions. Comparing the results of our research, InF3 can effectively catalyze the reaction, and the 1,4-adduct was more likely to be produced. The final result of our theory study agreed with the experimental data, meanwhile, self-consistent reaction field (SCRF) was carried out using the polarized continuum model (PCM) at the same theoretical level for geometry optimizations and frequency calculations in five different salvations. We predicted that the productivity to form 1,4-adduct was more higher catalyzed by InF3 in the solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO).

The obtained equilibrium structures are in excellent agreement with other experimental and theoretical results. The calculated formation energy indicates that the nitrides are thermodynamically metastable but mechanically stable at zero pressure. The calculated B/G ratio indicated RhN2 possesses a ductile nature at 0 GPa, while RuN2, OsN2, and IrN2 are prone to brittleness under pressures of around 20.8, 20.0, and 4.3 GPa, respectively. Then, we calculated the partial and total densities of states. The results show that these four noble-metal nitrides are metallic and the order of metallicity from high to low is: RhN2 > IrN2 > RuN2 > OsN2. Through the charge-density distributions, we find that strong covalency is present in the interstitial dinitrogen units for the four orthorhombic compounds. The calculated hardness of orthorhombic RuN2, RhN2, OsN2, and IrN2 are 13.66, 11.54, 16.33, and 17.92 GPa, respectively. Through the quasiharmonic Debye model, we also investigated the thermodynamic properties of these four compounds. (C) 2015 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Three analogues exhibit a hexagonal columnar (Col(h)) mesophase and their thermal stability increases with the introduction of hydroxyl and methoxy groups. The drift mobility measurements of Trx(OC8)3 and Trx(OH)3(OC8)3 reveal that the drift mobility is on the order of 5 x 10(-2)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) in the Colh phase and it increases to 10(-1)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) at the Colh-metastable phase transition, although Trx(OMe)3(OC8)3 shows a drift mobility of 1 x 10(-2)cm(2)V(-1) s(-1) in the Colh phase with temperature dependence. These results indicate that truxene with three alkoxy chains is an interesting molecular core for mesophase semiconductors.

Effect of exchange coupling on magnetic property in Sm-Co/alpha-Fe layered system	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						hysteresis loops; exchange coupling; micromagnetics; hard/soft bilayers	ENERGY PRODUCT; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; FILMS	The hysteresis loops as well as the spin distributions of Sm-Co/alpha-Fe bilayers have been investigated by both three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic calculations, focusing on the effect of the interface exchange coupling under various soft layer thicknesses t(s). The exchange coupling coefficient A(hs) between the hard and soft layers varies from 1.8 x 10(-6) erg/cm to 0.45 x 10(-6) erg/cm, while the soft layer thickness increases from 2 nm to 10 nm. As the exchange coupling decreases, the squareness of the loop gradually deteriorates, both pinning and coercive fields rise up monotonically, and the nucleation field goes down. On the other hand, an increment of the soft layer thickness leads to a significant drop of the nucleation field, the deterioration of the hysteresis loop squareness, and an increase of the remanence. The simulated loops based on the 3D and 1D methods are consistent with each other and in good agreement with the measured loops for Sm-Co/alpha-Fe multilayers.	[Sang, C. X.; Zhao, G. P.; Wan, X.

Tunneling interstitial impurity in iron-chalcogenide-based superconductors	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							FE-EXCESS; STATES	A pronounced local in-gap zero-energy bound state (ZBS) has been observed by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments on the interstitial Fe impurity (IFI) and its nearest-neighboring sites in an FeTe0.5Se0.5 superconducting (SC) compound. By introducing an impurity mechanism, the so-called tunneling impurity, and based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, we investigate the low-lying energy states of the IFI and the underlying Fe plane. The calculations are performed in the presence as well as in the absence of a magnetic field. We find the IFI-induced ZBS does not shift or split in a magnetic field as long as the tunneling parameter between the IFI and the Fe plane is sufficiently small and the Fe plane is deep in the SC state. Our results are in good agreement with experiments. We also show that in the underdoped cases, modulation of the spin density wave or charge density wave will suppress the intensity of the ZBS on the Fe plane in a vortex state.

Lattice constants and electronic band structures are in an excellent agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical values. TaN in both structures studied has a metallic nature and a strong hybridization of Ta 5d and N 2p are found from the spin density of states (DOS). Meanwhile, our LSDA+U calculations predicted a strong ferromagnetic state for CoSn-type structure and an obvious paramagnetic nature for WC-type structure. No phase transition are observed within cubic and hexagonal CoSn and WC structures under high pressures. Our results show WC-type TaN is the calculated ground-state structure among the three crystallographic structures studied under 120 GPa. Optical properties show that TaN in CoSn-type structure is a better dielectric material.

The artificial soil properties are very important for effective management of the slopes. This paper uses fractal and moment methods to characterize soil particle size distribution (PSD) and aggregates composition. The fractal dimension (D) showed linear relationships between clay, silt, and sand contents, with coefficients of determination from 0.843 to 0.875, suggesting that using of D to evaluate the PSD of artificial soils is reasonable. The bias (C-S) and peak convex (C-E) coefficients showed significant correlations with structure failure rate, moisture content, and total porosity, which validated the moment method to quantitatively describe soil structure. Railway slope (RS) soil has lower organic carbon and soil moisture, and higher pH than natural slope soil. Overall, RS exhibited poor soil structure and physicochemical properties, increasing the risk of soil erosion. Hence, more effective management measures should be adopted to promote the restoration of cut slopes.

These 3D flower-like architectures with diameter of about 6-8 mu m are composed of a large number of nanoplates, which are assembled in a radial form from the center to the surface. In addition, the morphology of the products can be easily controlled by the elaborate choice of the dosage of La3+ and organic ligand. Furthermore, these 3D flower-like architectures exhibit obvious and intense UV absorption, which can be used as a new efficient host lattice of luminescent materials.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston (1989), Di Nola et al. presented a procedure to find a minimal solution from a fixed solution of a system of fuzzy relation equations over complete infinitely distributive lattices, and put the question: is the minimal solution found by the procedure unique or not? In this paper, we give a negative answer to the question and make some further remarks. We not only give a necessary and sufficient condition for the uniqueness of such minimal solutions, but also characterize the existence of the least solution and a unique solution of a system of fuzzy relation equations over complete infinitely distributive lattices.

We found that TSBCS/BS can be mapped to a "fat" combined input-crosspoint queued (CICQ) switch. Consequently, the well-studied CICQ scheduling algorithms can be directly applied in TSBCS. Moreover, BS drastically reduces the time complexity of TSBCS scheduling when compared with ordinary CICQ switches of the same number of switch ports, which enables us to build a larger-capacity switch with reasonable scheduling complexity. We further show that TSBCS/BS can achieve 100 percent throughput under any admissible traffic if a stable CICQ scheduling algorithm is used. Direct cell forwarding schemes are proposed to overcome the performance drawback of BS under light traffic loads. With extensive simulations, we show that the performance of TSBCS/BS is comparable to that of output-queued switches and the latter are usually considered as theoretical optimal.

The results showed that the both the Trp-Sm(III) complex and the AO molecule could intercalate into the double helix of the DNA. The Sm(III)-(Trp)(3) complex was stabilized by intercalation into the DNA with binding constants: K-25 degrees C(circle minus)=7.14x10(5) L.mol(-1) and K-37 degrees C(circle minus) = 5.28x10(4) L.mol(-1), and it could displace the AO dye from the AO-DNA complex in a competitive reaction. Computation of the thermodynamic functions demonstrates that Delta H-r(m)circle minus is the primary driving power of the interaction between the Sm(III)(Trp)(3) complex and the DNA. The results from Scatchard and viscometry methods suggested that the interaction mode between the Sm(III)(Trp)(3) complex and the hs-DNA is groove binding and weak intercalation binding.

A field litter decomposition experiment was conducted during the winter in an alpine forest river on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Concentrations, release rates, and release rate per day of chromium (Cr), cadmium (Cd), and lead (Pb) were investigated in the foliar litter of willow (Salix paraplesia), azalea (Rhododendron lapponicum), cypress (Sabina saltuaria), and larch (Larix mastersiana) during the prefreezing, freezing, and thawing periods. Concentrations of Cr in willow, cypress, and larch; Cd in all foliar litter types; and Pb in azalea foliar litter increased following incubation over an entire winter. Both Cr and Pb showed patterns of accumulation during the prefreezing period and patterns of release in the freezing and thawing periods, but Cd showed accumulation in all three periods. Water temperature, pH, flow velocity, conductivity, and nutrient availability in the river were significantly related to the dynamics of these heavy metals in the decomposing foliar litter. The heavy metal accumulation pattern in running water suggested an absolute increase in metal mass, indicating that litter may act as an efficient metal "cleaner" and contribute to an ecosystem's capacity for self-purification.
