Making a sequential monotonization, we give recursively defined functions to estimate solutions of the inequality piecewise. In order to use the estimate to study boundedness and asymptotics of solutions for differential equations, we regard the estimating function as a solution of a nonautonomous difference equation, simplify the equation with composition of operators, and reduce our discussion to qualitative analysis of the difference equation so that we give results on monotonicity, boundedness and a-weighted boundedness for solutions of the inequality. As applications, we study boundedness and asymptotics of solutions for two impulsive differential equations. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The influence of Bi3+ and Eu3+ on microstructures and luminescence properties of the products are deeply investigated. The TEM results display that all the obtained products are irregular polyhedrons with a diameter in a range from 30 to 80 nm with the increasing substitution concentration of Eu3+. It was found that the introduction of Bi3+ hardly affects the morphology and size of the obtained products. Under the excitation of 393 nm NUV, all samples exhibit the typical emission of Eu3+ ions with main red and yellow emissions centered at 616 and 591 nm, respectively. After doping a small amount of Bi3+ ions, the largest emission intensity of the characteristic emissions of Eu3+ for the gained NGBF-x% Eu3+ nanocrystals appeared at x = 0.2, whereas it observed at x = 0.3 for the obtained NGF-x% Eu3+ nanocrystals. It is obviously that the introduction of 1% Bi3+ ions not only increases the emission intensity of Eu3+ ions significantly, but also reduces the doping concentration of Eu3+. Especially, studied NGBF-20% Eu3+ phosphor exhibits excellent stand up to thermal impact during thermal cycling between 298 and 473 K. A WLED device by merging a NUV chip, NGBF-20% Eu3+ phosphor and commercial (Sr,Ba)(2)SiO4: Eu2+ green phosphor/BaMgAl10O17: Eu2+ blue phosphor possesses suitable correlated color temperature (CCT, 7395 K) and high color rendering index (CRI, 90.8%). These results unambiguously show that the NGBF-x%Eu3+ nanocrystals are promising candidate for applications in WLEDs. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is well known that this constant must be at least lambda 1/2, where lambda(1) is the smallest positive eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix. The subject of this paper is a conjecture of the authors that for distance-regular graphs the Cheeger constant is at most lambda(1). In particular, we prove the conjecture for the known infinite families of distance-regular graphs, distance-regular graphs of diameter 2 (the strongly regular graphs), several classes of distance-regular graphs with diameter 3, and most distance-regular graphs with small valency.

In this work, we prepared a lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramic of (1-x)Bi0.47Na0.47Ba0.06TiO3-xSr(Zr0.8Nb0.16)O-3, which was synthesized via a normal solid-state route. The microstructure, dielectric properties and energy storage behavior of the ceramics were explored. The ceramics can be well sintered and situated in the region where rhombohedral and tetragonal phases coexist. The addition of Sr(Zr0.8Nb0.16)O-3 (SZN) significantly extends the dielectric-temperature plateau between T-s and T-m and reduces the remnant polarization P-r, but the large saturation polarization P-s is still maintained. Besides, the doping of SZN enhances the relaxation of the material and increases the dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) from 50 kV/cm (x = 0) to 100 kV/cm (x = 0.04 and 0.06). Therefore, the ceramic with x = 0.06 exhibits a high discharging efficiency (eta) of 71.1% and energy density (W) of 1.56 J/cm(3) at 100 kV/cm and shows the superior thermal stability with the changes in recoverable energy density (W-rec) and eta of less than 10% and 30% at the temperature range of 25-180 degrees C and the excellent frequency stability with the variations of W-rec and eta of less than 1.8% and 1% at the frequency range of 10 Hz-100 Hz.

Here, we propose a novel strategy to further improve gas sensor performance by introducing morphotropic phase boundaries that have a homogeneous chemical composition but inhomogeneous structures to regulate the band structure and interfaces. The Bi1-xLaxFeO3 samples located at the morphotropic phase boundary have good selectivity for acetone and showed better gas sensitivity than undoped samples. It is worth noting that the morphotropic phase boundary phase Bi0.9La0.1FeO3 exhibited ultralow concentration detection of 50 ppb acetone. The mechanism is that the morphotropic phase boundary phase provides a more efficient carrier and variation in hole accumulation layer. This work provides an alternative strategy for designing high-performance sensors in addition to traditional chemical and physical modifications.

Regularity of the solutions to this system is a primary issue from a mathematical point of view.

Namely, (H-1, H-k)-regularity of the first and second derivatives of the weak solutions to two-dimensional higher-order Navier-Stokes-Cahn-Hilliard system is obtained with the methods of energy estimates.

Microbial iron [Fe(III)] reduction is an important biogeochemical process that can be stimulated by ferrihydrite amendment to paddy soil. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the abundance and succession of the N-2-fixing bacterial community in ferrihydrite enriched paddy soils collected from Hunan (HN) and Sichuan (SC) provinces, China. The relationship between the N-2-fixing bacterial community and Fe(III) reduction was also assessed. When compared with the control treatment, ferrihydrite enrichment significantly enhanced nitrogenase (nifH) gene abundance by 8.05 x 10(5) to 4.45 x 10(6) copies g(-1) soil during the 40-day flooding of HN soil, while nifH gene abundance in SC soil was remarkably increased by 5.90 x 10(7) to 9.56 x 10(7) copies g(-1) soil during day 1 to 5 in response to ferrihydrite amendment. The relative abundance of N-2-fixing bacteria peaked on day 5 (21.5% in HN soil and 5.4% in SC soil) and gradually decreased to a stable abundance after day 20. Remarkable increases in relative abundance of N-2-fixing bacteria during the first 10 days of flooding were detected in both soils with ferrihydrite enrichment, whereas little difference was found after day 10 of flooding. During the early stage of flooding, the Shannon and Simpson indexes of N-2-fixing bacteria with ferrihydrite enrichment were significantly decreased, and the community structure changed greatly. Most N-2-fixing bacteria in ferrihydrite enriched paddy soils were phylogenetically related to the order Clostridiales, with some of those potentially capable of Fe(III) reduction. The community succession of N2-fixing bacteria closely correlated with Fe(III) reduction. Thus, improving N-2-fixation via stimulation of Fe(III) reduction might aid in the reduction of N-fertilizer application to paddy field. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

One hundred metabolites including forty-seven alkaloids, fifteen terpenes, thirty-two polyphenols and six other metabolites were rapidly identified through the in-house database alignment at first glance. Thirty-three alkaloids classified into five groups including camptothecin group (CG1-13), pumiloside group (PG1-5), strictosidinic acid group (SG1-3), vincosamide group (VG1-7), and a new hybrid group, vincosamide-camptothecin group (VC1-5) were mined and further characterized by MS/MS analyses. The identification of two untapped biosynthetic precursors, 2-hydroxypumiloside (PG2) and 16-hydroxy-15, 16-dihydrocamptothecoside (CG3), along with sixteen new alkaloids enables us for a better understanding of camptothecin biogenetic reasoning. The underlying enzymes involved in camptothecin biosynthesis were also proposed according to the guiding metabolic map, thus purposefully mining of enzymes involved in the downstream biosynthetic pathway of camptothecin could be initiated with the help of this map.

The influences of the doping concentration of Eu3+ on the microstructures and luminescence properties for the as-prepared Li0.1Na0.9Gd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) phosphors were investigated systematically. Our results indicate that the doping of Eu3+ hardly affect the microstructures while markedly impact luminescence properties for the Li0.1Na0.9Gd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) phosphors. Due to an effective energy transfer from Tb3+ to Eu3+ in the Li0.1Na0.9Gd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) phosphors, the multicolor emissions have been realized via varying the doping concentration of Eu3+ from 0 to 0.5, which can be adjusted from green -> yellow-green -> yellow -> orange -> red and yellow-green -> yellow -> orange -> red upon excitation of two visible light wavelengths (486 and 464 nm), respectively. Moreover, the doping of Eu3+ also can significantly boost the thermal stability of Li0.1Na0.9Gd0.5Tb0.5(MoO4)(2) phosphor, and the obtained Li0.1Na0.9Gd0.5Tb0.42Eu0.08(MoO4)(2) phosphor possesses superior thermal stability, can be expected as a candidate phosphor for white light diodes.

We present a novel driver's behavior simulation that considers both the stable personality of individuals and the changes in driving behavior when the environment changed. In this study, driving styles are classified as aggressive, careful, and anxious. The driving styles are analyzed from the perspectives of personality traits and emotion, and the driving parameters of each driving style are learned through simulator experiments. Given individual personality, traffic conditions, and driving environment as input, our approach can generate traffic flow that reflects driver's personalized driving behavior.

J	Chen, Q; Jia, R; Li, LN; Qu, D				Chen, Qin; Jia, Rong; Li, Lina; Qu, Dong			Effects of high concentrations of sulfate on dissolved organic matter in paddy soils revealed by excitation-emission matrix analyzing	CHEMOSPHERE			English	Article						Paddy soil; Sulfate pollution; Excitation-emission matrix spectra; Dissolved organic matter composition	EXTRACELLULAR POLYMERIC SUBSTANCES; FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY; ELECTRON-TRANSFER; CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION; WETLAND SOILS; LAND-USE; FE(III); CYANOBACTERIAL; DEGRADATION; TOXICITY	The problem of sulfate pollution is becoming increasingly serious in freshwater and wetlands. Since paddy fields are the largest constructed wetland in Earth's surface, the increased sulfate input may have great effect on dissolved organic matter (DOM) in paddy soils. To understand these effects, a 24-day anaerobic incubation experiment was conducted with four Chinese paddy soils amended with high concentrations (0, 10, 25, 50, and 100 mmol L-1) of Na 2 SO 4 . Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations were determined after incubation. Parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) of the excitation-emission matrix (EEM) spectra was used to analyze the DOM composition. In all four soils, DOC concentrations generally increased with increasing sulfate concentration, while the Chl a concentrations decreased. The EEM spectra of DOM were resolved into four components by PARAFAC. With increasing sulfate concentration, the proportion of the ultraviolet C humic acid-like compound decreased and the tyrosine-like compound increased in two algae-rich soils (Sichuan and Tianjin). No obvious variation was observed in the humification index (HIX) or the ratio of peak beta to peak alpha (beta:alpha) in any soils with added sulfate. Specific ultra-violet absorbance at 254 nm (SUVA(254)) decreased with increasing sulfate concentration in Jilin, Tianjin, and Ningxia soils, and the fluorescence index (FI) decreased in two algae-rich soils. In conclusion, although sulfate addition increased the DOC concentration, the DOM composition depended more strongly on soil type and physicochemical properties than sulfate. Sulfate addition only affected soil DOM origin and composition by inhibiting algal growth in algae-rich paddy soils. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The PD microplasma utilized a stainless-steel hollow needle as one of the electrodes, which also acts as the channel for the plasma gas and Hg vapor to enter the discharge region. This design allows the Hg vapor all transported and confined into the microplasma by internal diffusion, which helps to improve the sample introduction efficiency and excitation efficiency. Because of the efficient matrix separation by CVG, high selectivity and stability can be realized with this system. Under the optimized conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 0.15 ng mL(-1). The RSD (n = 7) was 2.7% for 5 ng mL(-1) of Hg2+. The proposed technique has been applied to the investigation of Hg content in TCM drugs with satisfactory analytical results. The method provides several advantages including simple, high sensitivity, compactness and cost-effectiveness for mercury assay in TCM.

J	Yin, SB; Wang, YB; Yang, YH				Yin, Shibai; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Yee-Hong			A novel image-dehazing network with a parallel attention block	PATTERN RECOGNITION			English	Article						Image dehazing; Spatial attention mechanism; Channel-wise attention mechanism; Encoder-decoder; CNN	ALGORITHM	Image dehazing is a very important pre-processing step to many computer vision tasks such as object recognition and tracking. However, it is a challenging problem because the physical parameters of imaging, e.g. the depth information of scene pixels and the attenuation model, are usually unknown. Based on a physical model, different methods have been proposed to recover these parameters. Existing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based methods try to solve the image dehazing problem using an end-to-end network to learn a direct mapping between a hazy image and its corresponding clear image. But the representational ability, spatial variant ability and dehazing capability of these network models are hindered by treating all the spatial and channel-wise features indiscriminately. Hence, we propose an end-to-end dehazing network with a parallel spatial/channel-wise attention block for capturing more informative spatial and channel-wise features respectively. Specifically, based on the encoder-decoder framework with a pyramid pooling operation, a novel parallel spatial/channel-wise attention block is proposed and applied to the end of the encoder for guiding the decoder to reconstruct better clear images. In the spatial/channel-wise attention block, the spatial attention module and the channel-wise attention module are connected in parallel, where the spatial attention module highlights important spatial positions of features. Meanwhile, the channel-wise module exploits inter-dependencies among the channel-wise features. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our network with a parallel spatial/channel-wise attention block can achieve better accuracy and visual results over state-of-the-art methods.

Astrocytic modulation of potassium under seizures	NEURAL REGENERATION RESEARCH			English	Review						AQP4; Ca2+ signaling; cell volume; connexins; epilepsy; K+ buffering; miRNA; NKCC; pannexin; TBI	CALCIUM EPILEPTIFORM ACTIVITY; RAT OPTIC-NERVE; K+ CHANNELS; CL-COTRANSPORTER; ANION CHANNELS; GAP-JUNCTION; GLUTAMATE; CA2+; DYSFUNCTION; HOMEOSTASIS	The contribution of an impaired astrocytic K+ regulation system to epileptic neuronal hyperexcitability has been increasingly recognized in the last decade. A defective K+ regulation leads to an elevated extracellular K+ concentration ([K+](o)). When [K+](o) reaches peaks of 10-12 mM, it is strongly associated with seizure initiation during hypersynchronous neuronal activities. On the other hand, reactive astrocytes during a seizure attack restrict influx of K+ across the membrane both passively and actively. In addition to decreased K+ buffering, aberrant Ca2+ signaling and declined glutamate transport have also been observed in astrogliosis in epileptic specimens, precipitating an increased neuronal discharge and induction of seizures. This review aims to provide an overview of experimental findings that implicated astrocytic modulation of extracellular K+ in the mechanism of epileptogenesis.

In this work, we conducted a detailed study on a phenomenon of thiol inhibition of mercury (Hg2+) cold vapor generation (CVG) and found L-cysteine (L-Cys), glutathione (GSH), dithiothreitol, N-Acetyl-L-cysteine, 3-mercaptopropionic acid, beta-mercaptoethanol, and NaI can inhibit the CVG of Hg2+, while EDTA has no inhibitory effect. Furthermore, changing the content of -SH can effectively adjust the CVG atomic fluorescence spectrometer (CVG-AFS) signal of Hg2+. As as a consequence, an AS-based homogeneous bioassay was constructed by adjusting the oxidation ratio and production quantity of -SH in the system. The quantitative analysis of the system was demonstrated by using AFS as a representative detector. Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and glucose were used as representative analytes for the validation of Hg2+ atomic fluorescence signal turn-off strategy, and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) as well as parathion (organophosphorus pesticides, OPs) as utilized as representative targets for the signal turn-on strategy. Under optimal experimental conditions, the homogeneous CVG-AFS sensor can be successfully used to detect 3 mu M H2O2, 30 mM glucose, 0.25 U/L BChE, and 0.4 mu g/mL parathion. In addition, the detection results of glucose and BChE in human serum samples agreed well with those obtained by using glucometer and kit, showing the promising potential of this method for practical applications.

Microorganisms associated with microbial iron [Fe(III)] reduction are prevalent and presumed to be closely linked with biological nitrogen fixation in flooded paddy soils.The relationship between the nitrogen-fixing bacteria (NFB) and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) and their responses to organic carbon addition were investigated based on the metabolically active bacterial community in flooded paddy soils amended with/without glucose (CK: 0 mol C kg(-1 )soil; OC: 0.1 mol C kg(-1) soil). Both putative NFBs and FeRBs were affiliated to the phyla Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, which were the two most abundant phyla in the metabolically active bacterial community. Glucose addition remarkably altered the community structures of the putative NFBs and FeRBs during a 40-day incubation, and the relative abundances of putative NFBs and FeRBs in the OC treatment increased by 0.21%-1.62% and 2.22%-14.82% relative to the CK treatment, respectively, during the later stage of incubation. The putative FeRBs co-occurred with NFBs and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, and the relative abundances of NFBs and hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria showed significant positive correlation with that of respiratory FeRBs. Some FeRBs could also be capable of nitrogen fixation and/or hydrogen oxidation. Thus, it might be feasible to enhance biological nitrogen fixation iciency by promoting the metabolic activities of FeRBs (such as by adding glucose), which contribute directly to biological nitrogen fixation associated with nitrogen-fixing Fe(III) reducers and indirectly by reducing the suppression of hydrogen on nitrogen fixation associated with hydrogen-dependent Fe(III) reducers.

Based upon above mentioned experiments and the structural parameters, the quantitative correlation between the structural parameters of sulfonamides molecules and their adsorption affinity (e.g. adsorption capacity and adsorption rate constant) onto CNTs was established, respectively. The adsorption data of sulfonamides fitted well with the pseudo - second - order kinetic model and the Langmuir isotherm model. The order of both pseudo - second - order kinetic constant and maximum adsorption capacity of the six sulfonamides were SAM < SMR < SMX < SDZ < SMT < SMD. The frontier molecular orbital energy (E-HOMO) and dipole moment (mu) could be used as indicators for the adsorption affinity of sulfonamides onto CNTs. Accordingly, the possible adsorption mechanism was proposed. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Soil aggregatet stability by mean weight diameter (MWD), geometric mean diameter (GMD), structure failure rate (P), index of unstable aggregates (IUA) and area difference of dry and wet sieve cumulative distribution curve (AS) were measured and analyzed. It was found that available soil nutrients, UR, and CAT activities increased initially and then decreased, but the texture of soil was finer, and aggregate structure tended to be more stable along with an increase in the altitude gradient. The soil aggregate stability index that MWD, GMD, P, IUA, and AS indicated that the higher the altitude, the stability of soil aggregates was better. Principal component analysis (PCA) was used to determine the soil quality index (SQI). The obtained results from this study showed that the artificial soil quality of the cut slopes was better at a higher altitude compared to a lower altitude. These results provide a reference for the improvement of artificial soil properties of cut slopes and their quality in the future. It is necessary to pay attention to the soil quality management at a low-altitude area and reform the soil nutrients, enzyme activities, and soil structure for the restored cut slopes in the mountainous subalpine highway of southwest China.

Mindfulness meditation was viewed as one of the effective ways to reduce PSD in patients with cancer. The present study tried to investigate whether mindfulness meditation has potential benefits in PSD and QOL for sICH patients in China. Methods Two hundred and two patients in West China Hospital, Sichuan University, enrolled from January 2017 to December 2018 were included in a randomized controlled trial. After removing missing values, there were 67 in control group and 67 in intervention group. Patients in intervention group received 2-month mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, and patients in control group received stress management education (ie, an active control). Results The results suggested that the significant differences of depression, trait mindfulness, social well-being, emotional well-being, and total score of QOL were found in intervention group from time 1 to time 2. Physical well-being and the score of NIH stroke scale experienced significant changes in both control group and intervention group over time. Conclusions Mindfulness-based intervention has positive effects on sICH patients' depression, social well-being, and emotional well-being. However, the change of trait mindfulness over time could not explain these positive effects. Future studies could explore the mechanism of mindfulness-based intervention on sICH patients' depression and QOL and clarify the boundaries of the positive effects of mindfulness-based intervention.

The developed models are similar to the Black-Scholes equation for valuing conventional European put options or the partial differential linear complementarity problem (LCP) for pricing American put options. A finite volume method is used for the discretization of the PDE models and a penalty approach is applied to the discretized LCP. We show that the coefficient matrix of the discretized systems is a positive-definite M-matrix which guarantees that the solution from the penalty equation converges to that of the discretized LCP. Numerical experiments, performed to demonstrate the usefulness of our methods, show that our models and numerical methods are able to produce financially meaningful numerical results for the two non-trivial test problems.

J	Yue, J; Liu, L; Zhang, HX				Yue, Jin; Liu, Liu; Zhang, Hongxia			Multivariate Nonparametric Control Chart With Storage Space	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INDUSTRIAL INFORMATICS			English	Article						Control charts; Monitoring; Process control; Aerospace electronics; Informatics; Memory management; Authentication; Banknote authentication; exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA); running time; spatial rank; storage space	QUALITY	Currently, it is important to monitor multivariate data in a timely manner. The spatial-rank-based multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart (SREWMA) has better relative performance for multivariate data monitoring when the underlying distribution is non-normal. However, with the increasing amount of data, the computation requires increasing system memory. Thus, the running speed of the computer and monitoring efficiency of the SREWMA control chart are reduced. Regarding this issue, this paper provides the concept of storage space and adding storage space to the proposed SREWMA control chart. When the observations in storage space reach a fixed number of spatial-rank calculations, the computer begins to control the amount of calculations and memory. The SREWMA with storage space control chart greatly improves the running speed of the SREWMA control chart and is robust for various distributions. Finally, a real-data example from banknote authentication is provided to illustrate the proposed method.

J	Wang, YZ; He, S; Duan, LW; Chen, QH				Wang, Yan-Zhi; He, Shu; Duan, Liwei; Chen, Qing-Hu			Rich phase diagram of quantum phases in the anisotropic subohmic spin-boson model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							TRANSITION; GAS; SUPERFLUID	We study the anisotropic spin-boson model (SBM) with the subohmic bath by a numerically exact method based on variational matrix product states. A rich phase diagram is found in the anisotropy-coupling strength plane by calculating several observables. There are three distinct quantum phases: a delocalized phase with even parity (phase I), a delocalized phase with odd parity (phase II), and a localized phase with broken Z(2) symmetry (phase III), which intersect at a quantum tricritical point. The competition between those phases gives an overall picture of the phase diagram. For small power of the spectral function of the bosonic bath, the quantum phase transition (QPT) from phase Ito III with mean-field critical behavior is present, similar to the isotropic SBM. The phase diagram with three different phases can be found at large power of the spectral function: For the highly anisotropic case, the system experiences the QPTs from phase Ito II via first order, and then to phase III via second order with the increase of the coupling strength. For the low anisotropic case, the system only experiences the continuous QPT from phase Ito phase III with the non-mean-field critical exponents. Very interestingly, at the moderate anisotropy, the system would display the continuous QPTs for several times but with the same critical exponents. This unusual reentrance to the same localized phase is discovered in light-matter interacting systems. The present study on the anisotropic SBM could open an avenue to the rich quantum criticality.

Many trials to widen the narrow bandgap of KTP have failed in the past few decades. A chemical cosubstitution strategy was implemented to design new members of the KTP-type family as potential UV NLO materials. First, a novel centrosymmetric KTP-type compound NH4SbFPO4H2O with a sharply enlarged bandgap (5.01 eV) was obtained through three-site aliovalent substitution. Second, the noncentrosymmetric NH4SbF2SO4 was synthesized by the introduction of more F- anions to destroy the crystal symmetry and SO42- to replace PO43- for balancing the charge in NH4SbFPO4H2O, which realized the transformation from a visible phosphate system to solar blind UV sulfate system for KTP-type family NLO materials. The preliminary experimental results indicated that NH4SbF2SO4 is a promising solar blind UV NLO material. The first-principles calculations revealed that the sharply enlarged bandgap resulted from the substitution of the transition metal cations with the main group metal cations and the introduction of F- anions with high electronegativity.

Here, a novel hybrid nanocatalyst comprising Pd and Ni(OH)(2) supported on porous carbon (PC) is developed. The obtained Pd-Ni(OH)(2)/PC nanocatalyst exhibits an excellent catalytic performance for FA dehydrogenation to produce hydrogen. The introduction of Ni(OH)(2) in PC support can significantly promote the catalytic activity of Pd NPs toward FA dehydrogenation. Additionally, the catalytic property of Pd-Ni(OH)(2) /PC is correlated with the Pd/Ni ratio. The Pd-2-Ni-1(OH)(2)/PC with the optimum Pd/Ni ratio of 2/1 exhibits the maximum turnover frequency (TOF) of 3409 h(-1) at 60 degrees C for FA dehydrogenation. The highly dispersed ultrafine Pd-Ni(OH)(2) hybrid NPs with numerous accessible active sites and Ni(OH)(2)-induced positive synergetic effects with Pd NPs considerably boost the catalytic performance for FA dehydrogenation.

The film was selectively degraded by cutinase and proteinase K to form a porous material. The porous materials were characterized with respect to their pore morphology, pore size, porosity and hydrophilicity. The porous materials were investigated in vitro degradation and in vivo compatibility. The results show that the pore size of the prepared porous materials could be controlled by the proportion of PBS and the degradation time. When the PBS composition of PBS/PLA blends was changed from 40wt% to 50wt%, the mean pore diameter of the porous materials significantly increased from 6.91 mu m to 120 mu m, the porosity improved from 81.52% to 96.90%, and the contact angle decreased from 81.08 degrees to 46.56 degrees. In vitro degradation suggests that the PBS-based porous materials have a good corrosion resistance but the PLA-based porous materials have degradability in simulated body fluid. Subcutaneous implantation of the porous materials did not cause intense inflammatory response, which revealed good compatibility. The results of hematoxylin and eosin and Masson's trichrome staining assays demonstrated that the porous materials promote chondrocyte production. Porous materials have great potential in preparing implants for tissue engineering applications.

We report the static properties of bimerons with different topological structures in a frustrated ferromagnetic monolayer, where the bimeron structure is characterized by the vorticity and helicity eta. It is found that the bimeron energy increases with Q(v) and the energy of an isolated bimeron with Q(v) = +/- 1 depends on eta. We also report the dynamics of frustrated bimerons driven by the spin-orbit torques, which depend on the strength of the dampinglike and fieldlike torques. We find that the isolated bimeron with Q(v) = +/- 1 can be driven into linear or elliptical motion when the spin polarization is perpendicular to the easy axis. We numerically reveal the damping dependence of the bimeron Hall angle driven by the dampinglike torque. Besides, the isolated bimeron with Q(v) = +/- 1 can be driven into rotation by the dampinglike torque when the spin polarization is parallel to the easy axis. The rotation frequency is proportional to the driving current density. In addition, we numerically demonstrate the possibility of creating a bimeron state with a higher or lower topological charge by the current-driven collision and merging of bimeron states with different Q(v). Our results could be useful for understanding the bimeron physics in frustrated magnets.

This paper aims to study the behavior of three main players involved in university student loans, namely, universities, banks and students and explores necessary conditions for promoting the steady development of student loans, as well as the sustainability of cooperation and coordination among players, thus promoting the further development of student loans. Design/methodology/approach First, from the perspectives of the three related players of banks, students and universities and their behavior, this paper establishes a three-player behavioral evolutionary game model, conducts a sustainable game analysis among the different players, and by replicating the dynamic equations with the Jacobian matrix solve the evolutionarily stable strategy. Finally, applying MATLAB tools, a sensitivity analysis of relevant impacting factors is carried out to explore the influencing mechanism of the sustainable development of student loans. Findings To achieve the mechanism of mutual coordination and cooperation between participants, banks need to be guided to actively issue student loans and conduct strict loan review. College students should be encouraged to establish good credit and strengthen penalties should be implemented for violations of regulations. Universities should be encouraged to help banks reduce information asymmetry, promote financial knowledge and student integrity education and promote the sustainable development of national student loans. Originality/value This research will help scholars better understand the interaction mechanism among universities, banks and students, and promote the sustainable development of national student loans.

In this work, terbium-based metal-organic frameworks (Tb-MOFs) have been prepared successfully via a facile and efficient route. These well-constructed Tb-MOFs architectures exhibit characteristic green emission of Tb3+ ion upon excitation of UV light. It is noteworthy that the Tb-MOFs can act as a convenient and efficient luminescent sensor for VOCs. Especially, the Tb-MOFs displayed high selectivity and superior sensitivity towards the sensing of styrene solution and vapor through fluorescence quenching mechanism. The Tb-MOFs can realize fast detection for styrene vapor with a response time of 30 s. The mechanism of fluorescence quenching of Tb-MOFs induced by styrene was also discussed. More importantly, we have designed a logic gate operation with the combination of the sensor for the intelligent detection of styrene. This developed type of lanthanide luminescent metal-organic frameworks (Ln-MOFs) based on the combination of fluorescence sensor and logic gate has a great application prospect in the detection of VOCs in daily life.

The Relationship between Insecure Attachment to Depression: Mediating Role of Sleep and Cognitive Reappraisal	NEURAL PLASTICITY			English	Article							EMOTION REGULATION; STYLE; PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; SUPPRESSION; SYMPTOMS; QUALITY; STRESS	Previously, we have shown that neuromodulators are important factors in stress-induced emotional disorders, such as depression, for example, serotonin is the major substance for depression. Many psychological studies have proved that depression is due to insecure attachment. In addition, sleep is a major symptom of depression. Furthermore, serotonin is the substrate for both sleep and depression. To explore the role of sleep in the relationships between insecure attachment and depression, we investigated 755 college students with Close Relationship Inventory, Emotion Regulation Questionnaire, Self-rated Depression Scale, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. The results showed that (1) insecure attachment positively predicted poor sleep quality; (2) sleep quality partially affected depression, possibly due the same stress neuromodulators such as norepinephrine and cortisol; and (3) cognitive reappraisal moderated the mediating path leading from attachment anxiety to poor sleep quality. These findings highlight the moderating role of cognitive reappraisal in the effects of attachment anxiety on sleep quality and finally on depression. In conclusion, sleep quality links attachment anxiety and emotional disorders.

A WBB partitioning scheme is considered, which allocates the whole bandwidth between the macrocell and small cells for data transmission and backhauling. We formulate an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum logarithmic utility function by jointly optimizing WBB portion and fronthaul power allocation of each base station with consideration of the backhaul capacity limitation on each small cell. In order to solve this joint optimization problem, we propose a hierarchical two-level approach and decompose the original problem into two independent subproblems: the WBB allocation at the macrocell base station (MBS) and the power allocation at both the MBS and small cell base stations (SBSs). Accordingly, the optimal WBB portion and power allocation solutions are obtained, respectively. Furthermore, we develop a distributed algorithm to implement the joint WBB and power allocation. Numerical results verify the effectiveness of the proposed approach and analyze the impact of the weighted coefficient and backhaul capacity limitation on the network performance. In addition, significant performance gains can be achieved by the proposed approach over the benchmark.

J	Cheng, C; Duan, MY; Wang, Z; Zhou, XL				Cheng, Cai; Duan, Man-Yi; Wang, Zhao; Zhou, Xiao-Lin			AlB2 and MgB2: a comparative study of their electronic, phonon and superconductivity properties via first principles	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article; Early Access						Carrier doping; Strain engineering; Superconductivity; Electron-phonon coupling; AlB2-type compounds	TRANSITION-TEMPERATURE; T-C	Recently, the AlB2-type compounds (such as AlB2 and MgB2) which exhibit Dirac Nodal Line (DNLs) semimetal on their electronic band structure and Phononic Weyl Nodal Straight Lines (PTWNLs) on their phonon spectrum, have received wide attentions on their novel properties. Up to date, no comparative studies have been investigated on their electronic structures, phonon spectrum, and electron phonon coupling (EPC) under the conditions of carrier doping and strain engineering. Here, we systemically investigate their above properties under carrier doping and strain engineering by first-principles calculations. The results show that the superconducting transition temperature T-c can be enhanced by electron doping and tensile strain. For AlB2, the tensile strain of 6% can enhance T-c to 10.25 K and with the doping concentrate of 0.1 e(-) per cell can enhance T-c reach to 9.89 K. Moreover, the physical quantities related to superconductivity of AlB2 are more affected by carrier doping than MgB2. Our results provide a theoretical reference to explore the correlation between electronic and phonon topological properties in AlB2-type materials.

Herein, the exfoliated black phosphorus (BP) nanosheets were coupled with BiOBr nanosheets having higher Fermi level, and thereby it constructed a novel layered BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction with chemically bonding, larger contact interface and unique band structures. BiOBr nanosheets were self-assembled on the surface of BP nanosheets by a facile liquid-phase ultrasound combined with solvothermal method. The photocatalytic performance for tetracycline (TC) degradation, oxygen evolution and H2O2 production rate of Sol-10BP/BiOBr was 7.8, 7.0 and 2.6 times than that of pure BiOBr, respectively. The in-situ generated H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot became the main active species of mineralization and decomposition of TC. The novel S-scheme two-dimensional BP/BiOBr nano-heterojunction for boosting spatial charge separation retained the useful holes-electrons with higher redox ability, which was very beneficial for producing more (OH)-O-center dot, H2O2 and O-2, and the photocatalytic activity was greatly improved.

We particularly focus on the theoretical, computational and experimental findings and advances that are directly relevant to the spintronic applications based on magnetic skyrmions, i.e. their writing, deleting, reading and processing driven by magnetic field, electric current and thermal energy. We then review several potential applications including information storage, logic computing gates and non-conventional devices such as neuromorphic computing devices. Finally, we discuss possible future research directions on magnetic skyrmions, which also cover rich topics on other topological textures such as antiskyrmions and bimerons in antiferromagnets and frustrated magnets.

Methods: Cytotoxicity was characterized by MTT assay and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of SMMC-7721 cells ultrastructure. The apoptotic effect of the essential oil was evaluated by changes in mitochondrial membrane potential and Western blot assay. Results: MTT assay data indicate that the essential oil was cytotoxic to SMMC-7721 cells, while TEN revealed that there were vacuoles and nucleus fragmentation in the SMMC-7721 cell cytosol, cell swelling, and a large amount of leakage. Mitochondrial membrane potential assay and Western Blot data indicate that the essential oil induced cell apoptosis. Conclusion: The essential oil of Chenopodium ambrosioides L. in Sichuan Province seems to induce apoptosis of human liver cancer SMMC-7721 cells via the mitochondrial-mediated pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Thus, this plant requires further investigation as a potential source of an anti-liver cancer drug.

Considerable efforts have been put on panda conservation and reproduction, offering the promising outcome of maintaining the population size of pandas. To evaluate the effectiveness of conservation and management strategies, recognizing individual pandas is critical. However, it remains a challenging task because the existing methods, such as traditional tracking method, discrimination method based on footprint identification, and molecular biology method, are invasive, inaccurate, expensive, or challenging to perform. The advances of imaging technologies have led to the wide applications of digital images and videos in panda conservation and management, which makes it possible for individual panda recognition in a noninvasive manner by using image-based panda face recognition method. In recent years, deep learning has achieved great success in the field of computer vision and pattern recognition. For panda face recognition, a fully automatic deep learning algorithm which consists of a sequence of deep neural networks (DNNs) used for panda face detection, segmentation, alignment, and identity prediction is developed in this study. To develop and evaluate the algorithm, the largest panda image dataset containing 6,441 images from 218 different pandas, which is 39.78% of captive pandas in the world, is established. The algorithm achieved 96.27% accuracy in panda recognition and 100% accuracy in detection. This study shows that panda faces can be used for panda recognition. It enables the use of the cameras installed in their habitat for monitoring their population and behavior. This noninvasive approach is much more cost-effective than the approaches used in the previous panda surveys.

We review the concept of picture 2-tuple linguistic sets and introduce its corresponding score function, accuracy function, and operational laws. In addition, we propose two aggregation operators of picture 2-tuple linguistic numbers and then develop a method by combining traditional MABAC model with the overall picture 2-tuple linguistic evaluation information. Our proposed method is increasingly accurate and valid even when the conflicting attributes are considered. We also provide a numerical instance for assessing and selecting the renewable energy power generation project to demonstrate the efficacy of our novel model. Finally, we compare our proposed approach with other traditional operators to further show its benefits.

In this method, the linguistic term sets (LTSs) is converted into probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs). For deriving the weight information of the attribute, an optimization model is built on the basis of the fundamental idea of conventional TOPSIS method, by which the attribute weights can be decided. In addition, the optimal alternative(s) is decided by computing the shortest distance from the probabilistic linguistic positive ideal solution (PLPIS) and on the other side the farthest distance of the probabilistic linguistic negative ideal solution (PLNIS). The method has precise trait in probabilistic linguistic information processing. The information distortion and losing was avoided which happen formerly in the probabilistic linguistic information processing. In the end, a case study for green supplier selection is given to demonstrate the merits of the developed method. The results display that the approach is uncomplicated, valid and simple to compute.

Herein, the hierarchical core-shell nanostructure has been rationally designed by coating highly electrically conductive Co9S8 on MnO2 arrays on Ni foam (MnO2@Co9S8/NF) using a simple solution-based method. The prepared MnO2@Co9S8/NF exhibits a high specific capacitance of 643.3 C g(-1) at 3 mA cm(-2), which is 3.4 and 10.1 times higher than the Co3O4@MnO2 and pristine MnO2 electrodes, respectively. Moreover, the asymmetric supercapacitor (ASC) with MnO2@Co9S8 composite electrode provides a high areal capacitance of 1540 mC cm(-2) and a maximum energy density of 346.5 mW h cm(-2) (35 Wh kg(-1)) at the power density of 2376 mW cm(-2) (240 W kg(-1)). Importantly, the excellent cycling life with a capacitance retention of 97.5% after 36,000 cycles indicates the good stability of the core-shell structure of the composite electrode. These superior electrochemical properties of current materials are comparable to the most advanced MnO2-based electrodes for supercapacitors. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

While evaluating the treatment efficacy of the MW-PS-H2O2 process, the effects of MW power, PS dosage, n(PS)/n(H2O2) ratio, and initial pH on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and reaction kinetics (k(obs)) were investigated. The transformation of organics was also examined. The best treatment efficacy (COD removal = 73.92% and k(obs) = 0.1996 mg/(L min)) after a reaction time of 16 min was achieved using optimized operation parameters (initial pH = 3.0, PS dosage = 3.70 mmol/L, H2O2 dosage = 2.45 mmol/L, MW power = 450 W). Increasing MW power and PS dosage within certain ranges and an acidic environment improved treatment efficacy, but too high MW power and too low H2O2 dosage (indicated by too high n(PS)/n(H2O2) ratio) significantly inhibited treatment efficacy. The benzene-ring structure, nitro group, and diazo group of organics in the wastewater were greatly degraded. The radicals SO4(A) over cap center dot- and (OH)-O-center dot were major contributors to organics degradation, and the major reactive oxygen species differed under different operation parameters. The MW-PS-H2O2 process improved the biodegradability of the wastewater 10-fold (to 0.606) and required approximately half as much electrical power as comparative processes (MW-PS and MW-H2O2). Therefore, the MW-PS-H2O2 binary-oxidant process is an effective and promising DDNP industrial wastewater pre-treatment method, and shows superior treatment efficacy compared to single-oxidant processes while also consuming less electrical power.

The mechanism of the ligand effect during QDs synthesis was also studied by theoretical calculation. This strategy is based on that L-Cys can be used as both H2O2 substrate and ligand to mediate biomimetic synthesis of luminescent CdTe QDs. Iodide (F) can catalytic oxidized L-Cys to L-cystine in the presence of H2O2, which inhibits the synthesis of QDs. Hence, the degree of inhibition for the QDs synthesis is proportional to the H2O2 concentration. Additionally, the ligand effect of L-Cys and L-cystine for CdTe QDs synthesis was studied. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations showed that the combination of CdTe QDs with L-Cys had higher energy and more stable configuration than that with L-cystine, indicating that L-Cys is the more stable ligand of QDs. Under the optimized conditions, a low limit of detection (LOD) was obtained for H2O2 (0.3 nM). Then, we used H2O2 as a bridge for glucose detection, with a LOD of 5 nM. The feasibility of this sensor was demonstrated by rapid detection of H2O2 and glucose by naked-eye at a level of 10 nM.

Electrochemical N-2 reduction offers a carbon-neutral and energy-saving method for NH3 synthesis under ambient conditions. Herein, we demonstrate the first use of ZrO2 nanoparticles as an earth-abundant electrocatalyst for NH3 synthesis from N-2 and water under ambient conditions. In 0.1 M HCl, the electrocatalyst presents a large NH3 yield rate of 24.74 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) with a faradaic efficiency of 5.0% at -0.45 V vs. the reversible hydrogen electrode. It also demonstrates high electrochemical stability and excellent selectivity for NH3 generation.

In our design, the quaternized azatriphenylene core is surrounded by four to six flexible aliphatic chains and various types of anions, including small inorganic anions (i.e. Br-, I-, NO3-, BF4-, PF6-), and organic ones such as triflate, bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, tosylate, saccharinate, d and l camphorsulfate, alkylsulfonates, and alkylsulfates. The mesophases and thermal behaviour of the salts were characterized by polarizing optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, thermal gravimetry and small-angle X-ray scattering. A classical hexagonal columnar mesophase, i.e. p6mm-Col(hex), was observed for most salts. Two exotic new phases were however identified for four compounds, namely a mesophase with a hexagonal lattice of p3m1 symmetry (Hex), and another mesophase with a rectangular lattice of pseudo-hexagonal geometry (i.e. a/b = root 3) of p2mg symmetry (Rec(phex)). The former results from the bulkiness of the triflimide anion and the arrangement of columns into a honeycomb lattice, whereas the latter is induced by the clustering of three columns, disposed according to a low-symmetry rectangular lattice. Their temperature ranges and stabilities strongly depend as expected on the anion type and the number (and length) of the alkyl side-chains (O- and N-alkyl, respectively), highlighting the delicate balance and interplay between van der Waals, electrostatic and pi-pi core interactions. The UV/Vis absorption and fluorescent emission spectra were measured, and a strong yellow light photoluminescence was observed depending on the anion type, whereas anion-selective luminescence was observed in thin films. The neutral azatriphenylene precursor, 6,7,10,11-tetrakis(hexyloxy)dibenzo[f,h]isoquinoline, is also an interesting luminophore, showing an absolute emission quantum yield of 75%, while the corresponding salts exhibit anion-selective emission quantum yields as high as 20%.

However, these markers have rarely been studied related to aging and depression within one study. Here, we investigated auditory event-related potentials (ERPs) in the brain that may show different alterations related to aging and depression. We used an oddball condition employing changes in sound intensity to investigate: (i) sound intensity dependence; (ii) sensory gating; and (iii) change detection, all within a single paradigm. The ERPs of younger (18-40 years) and older (62-80 years) depressed female participants and age-matched non-depressed participants were measured. Intensity dependence was examined as the difference between N1 responses to repeated high- and low-intensity sounds, sensory gating as N1 responses to rare and repeated sounds, and change detection as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN). We found that intensity dependence was greater in older participants than younger ones, indicating effects related to aging but not to depression. For sensory gating, we found depression- and age-related alterations as increased N1 responses. No group differences were found for MMN. Although a sensory gating deficit was expected in older adults, this study is the first to demonstrate age-related overexcitability in sound intensity dependency. The results indicate that automatic brain responses to sound intensity changes are suitable for studying age- and depression-related neural markers but may not be sensitive enough to differentiate the effects of aging and depression.

In this work, we investigate the relationship between the skyrmion dynamics and the characteristics of injected current in a skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillator, where the excitation source is introduced from a point nano-contact at the center of the nanodisk. It is found that the skyrmion will move away from the center of the nanodisk if it is driven by a spin-polarized current; however, it will return to the initial position in the absence of stimulus. Therefore, we propose a skyrmion-based artificial spiking neuron, which can effectively implement the leaky-integrate-fire operation. We study the feasibility of the skyrmion-based spiking neuron by using micromagnetic simulations. Our results may provide useful guidelines for building future magnetic neural networks with ultra-high density and ultra-low energy consumption.

Recently, Na-3(VPO4)(2)O2F (NVPOF) expresses strong competitiveness under high working voltage in sodium storage field because of its eximious structural stability and high energy density. Nevertheless, the intrinsically poor electronic conductivity hinders its electrochemical performance. Herein, 1 D carbon nanotube (CNT) and 2 D polyaniline (PANI) are utilized as self-templates to prepare NVPOF@CNT/PANI polyhedrons via a facile and cost-efficient synthetic route. The highly conductive CNT/PANI scaffold can offer a quick electron transfer pathway. Benefiting from this unique design, NVPOF@CNT/PANI shows excellent electrochemical performance : delivering a high specific capacity of 125.3 mAh g(-1) at 0.5 C, excellent rate property of 62.7 mAh g(-1) at 20 C, and long lifespan of 2000 cycles with the capacity of 44.1 mAh g(-1) at 10 C. This work for NVPOF gives a promising method to prepare the high-performance cathode material for sodium-ion battery, and this approach can also extend to optimize other battery materials.

Herein, we developed a convenient, efficient, and scalable method for the construction of monometallic Co-LDHs with tunable Con+ (n = 2, 3) concentration by a one-pot solvothermal reaction in a short time (e.g., 2 and 4 h) using only cobalt nitrate and hexamine as raw materials. The catalytic performance of Co-LDHs was mainly determined by the Con+ (n = 2, 3) concentration, which could be simply regulated by tuning the solvothermal time. Combining the joint merits of three-dimensional flowerlike architecture (abundant accessible active sites and a fast electron/mass transport), Co-LDHs-4 with abundant Co3+ species exhibited an excellent electrocatalytic activity for oxygen evolution reaction in terms of a low overpotential at 10 mA cm(-2) (eta(10) = 241 mV) and long-term durability for 70 h at 100 mA cm(-2), better than the state-of-the-art IrO2 and most of the reported analogues. Besides, Co-LDHs-2 enriched in Co3+ displayed a superior electrochemical activity for H2O2 detection with a broad linear range (0.002-20 mM), a low detection limit (0.002 mM), and a high response sensitivity (272.02 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2)). Therefore, this work opens a new horizon for the rational development of a highly active electrocatalyst with tunable concentrations of active components.

Here, we developed a space confinement-assisted strategy for the construction of highly dispersed and ultrasmall Rh NCs supported on 3D nanosheet-assembled hierarchical carbon architectures (NHCAs) as advanced electrocatalysts for alkaline HER. Benefiting from the abundant and ultrasmall micro/mesopores of NHCAs, uniformly dispersed Rh NCs with diameters of 1.83 nm were embedded in NHCAs without the aid of surface capping agents. The resultant Rh NCs/NHCAs exhibited excellent electrochemical HER activity with low overpotentials of 7 and 48 mV at 10 and 100 mA cm(-2) current densities in basic solution, respectively, superior than most of the previous developed electrocatalysts. The surface-clean and ultrafine Rh NCs with high dispersity on the NHCAs surface could provide abundant surface-active sites and resulted in the high performance of Rh NCs/NHCAs for HER. The present study may offer a novel yet convenient pathway to synthesize highly dispersed and catalytically active supported noble metal electrocatalyst for catalytic applications.

In this study, structural magnetic resonance images (sMRIs) from SZ patients and NCs were used for discriminative analysis. This study proposed an ML framework based on coarse-to-fine feature selection. The proposed framework used two-sample t-tests to extract the differences between groups first, then further eliminated the nonrelevant and redundant features with recursive feature elimination (RFE), and finally utilized the support vector machine (SVM) to learn the decision models with selected gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) features. Previous studies have tended to report differences at the group level instead of at the individual level and cannot be widely applied. The method proposed in this study extends the diagnosis to the individual level and has a higher recognition rate than previous methods. The experimental results of this study demonstrate that the proposed framework distinguishes SZ patients from NCs, with the highest classification accuracy reaching over 85%. The identified biomarkers are also consistent with previous literature findings. As a universal method, the proposed framework can be extended to diagnose other diseases.

A new type of double-layer sustained-release carbon source microspheres was prepared using cheap agricultural waste as carbon source. The carbon release performance and denitrification performance of three kinds of agricultural wastes, peanut shell, corn cob, and walnut shell, under different particle sizes were studied, and the optimal inner carbon source was chosen. And the carbon release performance and application in biological denitrification of sodium alginate microspheres were studied by immobilization technology. The results showed that corn cob with particle size < 0.125 mm had better carbon and nitrogen release properties. After embedding and fixing, the total nitrogen (TN) concentration of double-layer carbon source microspheres can be treated to 13.92 mg/L at a temperature of 30 degrees C, pH 7.2 similar to 7.5, and TN concentration of 42.95 mg/L, and the treatment effect was satisfactory with the national standard (GB 18918-2002) for municipal wastewater, which is better than the treatment effect of single-layer carbon source microspheres. It can be seen that double-layer slow-release carbon source microspheres have greater potential than single-layer microspheres for denitrification of domestic sewage.

The antioxidant activities were evaluated using the DPPH radical scavenging ability assay and the ability to inhibit lipid peroxidation. All of the tested anthocyanins showed good antioxidant activities. Also, two main antioxidative mechanisms, including H atom transfer (HAT) and single electron transfer (CT), were examined at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level of theory. The results showed 4'-OH possessed lower bond dissociation enthalpy (BDE) values compared with that of other OH groups. All anthocyanins were demonstrated that can be used as good candidates to donate an H atom to give rise to originate stable radical species. Among all investigated molecules, resveratrol exhibited the lowest ionization potential (IP). And four anthocyanins displayed significantly various IP values after substituted with glycoside ligand. Analysis of necessary pharmacophores by the molecular simplification method suggested that the synergetic effect of simplified models was responsible for the antioxidative activity.

By employing the transfer matrix method accompanied with genetic algorithm, the designed metamaterials with simple geometries can achieve broadband infrared absorption as well as tunable reflective colors simultaneously. The average absorptivity from 8 to 13 mu m is higher than 95%, and maintains high performance even at large incident angles. Besides, since the structural colors were originated from the thin-film interference effects, the color of these devices can be easily tuned from blue to pink by varying the thickness of the top layer. The features described above indicate that the proposed structures can be used for many practical applications such as multi-spectral imagers, bolometers, solar cell and radiative coolers, while can also meet people's aesthetic or functional requirements for the surface color of objects.

However, it is still a great challenge to enhance the figure of merit and sensitivity of sensors in near-infrared wavelengths due to the inherent resistive loss of conventionally used metallic materials. In this paper, we designed an all-dielectric metasurface composed of asymmetric double nanorods to achieve ultra-narrow band Fano resonance. Benefitting from the interference of bright mode and dark mode, a sharp and wavelength-adjustable reflectance peak can be obtained, offering an excellent platform for biological sensing and detection.

Uniform precursor water droplets containing surfactants and homogenized fine oil droplets with a relatively high volume ratio are generated from microfluidics as templates for microparticle synthesis via hydrolysis/condensation reaction. The SiO2 microparticles possess hierarchical porous structures, containing both mesopores with size of several nanometers, and well-controlled and highly-interconnected macropores with size of hundreds of nanometers. The SiO2 microparticles synergistically integrate fast mass transfer and large functional surface area for enhanced adsorption. To demonstrate the enhanced adsorption performances for organic dyes and toxic heavy metal ions, the microparticles are respectively used for removal of methylene blue in water, and modified with thiol-groups for removal of Pb2+ ions in water. Meanwhile, the microparticles can be easily recycled by magnetic field for reuse.

Maladaptive instructed fear produces detrimental effects on health, but little is known about performing an efficient regulation of instructed fear and its underlying neural substrates. To address this question, 26 subjects performed an instructed fear task where emotional experiences and functional neuroimages were recorded during watching, explicit regulation (calmness imagination), and implicit regulation (calmness priming) conditions. Results indicated that implicit regulation decreased activity in the left amygdala and left insula for instructed fear; however, these effects were absent in explicit regulation. The implementation of implicit regulation did not increase activity in the frontoparietal control regions, while explicit regulation increased dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activity. Furthermore, implicit regulation increased functional connectivity between the right amygdala and right fusiform gyrus, and decreased functional connectivity between the right medial temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus, which are key nodes of memory retrieval and cognitive control networks, respectively. These findings suggest a favourable effect of implicit regulation on instructed fear, which is subserved by less involvement of control-related brain mechanisms.

Importance Impulsivity during periods of abstinence is a critical symptom of patients who use methamphetamine (MA). Objective To evaluate changes in impulse inhibition elicited by repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with MA addiction. Design, Setting, and Participants This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Da Lian Shan Addiction Rehabilitation Center, Nanjing, China, from December 1, 2018, to April 20, 2019. Effects of the intervention were examined at 3 time points: after a single session (day 1), 24 hours after 10 repeated sessions (day 11), and at 3 weeks of follow-up (day 31). Men with MA addiction and healthy male control participants were recruited for this study. Data analysis was performed from March 2019 to October 2019. Interventions Patients who use MA were randomized to undergo sham rTMS (36 patients) and or 1-Hz rTMS (37 patients) to the left prefrontal cortex, receiving daily TMS treatments for 10 consecutive days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was impulse inhibition, which is primarily embodied by accuracy reduction (ie, accuracy cost) from standard to deviant trials in a 2-choice oddball task (80% standard and 20% deviant trials). Result The study included 73 men with MA addiction (mean [SD] age, 38.49 [7.69] years) and 33 male healthy control participants without MA addiction (mean [SD] age, 35.15 [9.68] years). The mean (SD) duration of abstinence for the men with MA addiction was 9.27 (4.61) months. Compared with the control group, patients with MA addiction exhibited greater impulsivity (accuracy cost, 3.3% vs 6.2%). The single session of 1-Hz rTMS over the left prefrontal cortex significantly increased accuracy from 91.4% to 95.7% (F-1,F-36 = 9.58; P < .001) and reaction time delay from 50 milliseconds to 77 milliseconds (F-1,F-36 = 22.66; P < .001) in deviant trials. These effects were seen consistently after 10 sessions of 1-Hz rTMS treatment (day 11 vs day 1, t(26) = 1.59; P = .12), and the behavioral improvement was maintained at least for 3 weeks after treatment (day 31 vs day 1, t(26) = 0.26; P = .80). These improvement effects of impulse inhibition were coupled with a reduction in addictive symptoms as measured by cue-induced craving. The pretest accuracy cost was positively correlated with the change in impulse inhibition (r = 0.615; P < .001) and change in craving (r = 0.334; P = .01), suggesting that these 2 behaviors may be modified simultaneously. Conclusions and Relevance These findings suggest that repeated rTMS sessions have sustained effects on impulse inhibition in patients with MA addiction and provide novel data on impulsivity management strategies for addiction rehabilitation. Question Is low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation associated with reduced behavioral impulsivity in patients who use methamphetamine? Findings In this randomized clinical trial, patients who use methamphetamine exhibited greater impulsivity than healthy control participants, and low-frequency repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation over the left prefrontal cortex improved impulsivity control in these patients. Meaning These findings suggest that brain stimulation could be adopted for impulsivity intervention in the rehabilitation of patients who use methamphetamine.

And nearly thirty kinds of greenhouse gases have been found in the atmosphere, of which the carbon dioxide plays a crucial role. In this paper, the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) countries are investigated by using a conformable fractional non-homogeneous grey model. The grey model is systematically studied based on the new definitions of the conformable fractional accumulation and difference. The closed-form solutions of the new model are derived by applying mathematical tools and grey theory. And the meta-heuristic algorithm ant lion optimizer is adopted to search optimal fractional order. With raw data during the period from 2000 to 2018 announced by British Petroleum, the new model is established to forecast the carbon dioxide emissions of BRICS nations from 2019 to 2025. The results show that the trend of the carbon dioxide emissions of Brazil and India is growing year by year, the pattern of Russia is fluctuant but remains stable generally, while China and South Africa reach its peak value in 2019, and then decrease in the next several years. It also demonstrates that the governments of Brazil and India should take more measures to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, while the governments of China and South Africa should keep up their crucial work on carbon dioxide emissions.

However, it remains a significant challenge to prepare fully bio-based oil absorbents that combines fast oil/water separation capacity, adequate mechanical robustness and easy recyclability through green and facile strategy. Inspired by the fascinating structure of wood, here we report a highly porous and anisotropic bio-based aerogel by taking advantage of the directional freezing technology, followed by a freeze-drying and silylation process. Due to the directional growth of ice crystals along the vertical direction, a special spring like morphology was obtained, which is mainly composed of well aligned low-tortuosity channels that seamlessly connected to bottom layer. Superior mechanical properties that allow for high mechanical compressing and fast elastic recovery were consequently acquired. Moreover, the silylated CS aerogel displays a rather high oil absorption capacity of 63 g g(-1), together with excellent recyclability via simple hand squeezing. By virtue of such hierarchical morphology, a device that could continuously separate oil from water was successfully designed. Given the natural abundance of raw material as well as the easy processability, this work would lay solid foundation for further fabrication of bio-based oil absorbents toward low-cost, high-performance and large-scale commodities.

However, most COFs fabricated by various methods are in the form of microcrystalline powders, making them difficult in separation. In this study, magnetic COFs were prepared by a simple impregnation method. The as-prepared samples with Ms = 5.2 emu g(-1) showed a good magnetic separation capability. Additionally, the adsorption performance of magnetic COFs towards antibiotics (e.g., diclofenac and sulfamethazine) was also studied. Various adsorption kinetic models (e.g., the pseudo first-order, the pseudo second-order, and mixed-order models) and adsorption isotherm models (e.g., the Freundlich, the Langmuir, and the Sips models) were used to study their adsorption kinetics and isotherms. Furthermore, density functional theory (DFT) was utilized to predict the interaction between adsorbents and adsorbates and to explain the partial adsorption mechanisms.

The influences of reaction time and reaction temperature on phase purities and morphologies of ZnMoO4 microcrystals have been investigated in detail. The results illustrate that 3D flower-like single crystalline ZnMoO4 microcrystals with mesoporous architecture can be obtained after being hydrothermal treated at 150 degrees C for 12 h, which can enhance the stability of structure and facilitate the diffusion of lithium ions. When applied as lithium-ion batteries anode materials, they can deliver a high discharge capacity of 514.9 mAh g(-1) at a current rate of 1 C after 500 cycles with nearly 92% capacity retention based on the discharge capacity of 2nd cycle. Most importantly, they also present superior electrochemical performances even at high rates (the capacities of 316.2 and 216.9 mAh g(-1) even after 2000 cycles at very large current rate of 5 and 10 C, respectively). The electrochemical results further confirm that 3D flower-like single crystalline ZnMoO4 microcrystals possess high capacity, good rate capability and superior cyclic stability. Our work may provide an effective and facile strategy to control the microstructures and boost the electrochemical performances for transition metal molybdate electrode materials.

Multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis of AnEPG (an endo-alpha-1,4-polygalacturonase from Aspergillus nidulans) and other GH 28 endo-polygalacturonases suggested that AnEPG is different from others. AnEPG overexpressed in Pichia pastoris was characterized. AnEPG showed the highest activity at pH 4.0, and exhibited moderate activity over a narrow pH range (pH 2.0-5.0) and superior stability in a wide pH range (pH 2.0-12.0). It displayed the highest activity at 60 degrees C, and retained >42.2% of maximum activity between 20 and 80 degrees C. It was stable below 40 degrees C and lost activity very quickly above 50 degrees C. Its apparent kinetic parameters against PGA (polygalacturonic acid) were determined, with the K-m and k(cat) values of 8.3 mg/mL and 5640 mu mol/min/mg, respectively. Ba2+ and Ni2+ enhanced activity by 12.2% and 9.4%, respectively, while Ca2+, Cu2+, and Mn2+ inhibited activity by 14.8%, 12.8%, and 10.2% separately. Analysis of hydrolysis products by AnEPG proved that AnEPG belongs to an endo-polygalacturonase. Modelled structure of AnEPG by I-TASSER showed structural characteristics of endo-polygalacturonases. This pectinase has great potential to be used in food industry and as feed additives.

The as-prepared hybrid material 1 wt%Fe- SnO2/g-C3N4 (1 wt%Fe-SCN) exhibited enhanced activity for both photodegradation of Rhodamine B (RhB) and Methylene blue (MB) under simulated solar light irradiation. The apparent rate constant, k, for MB degradation of 1 wt%Fe-SCN was 0.062min(-1) (10.88 times and 7.56 times higher than that of pure SnO2 and pure g-C3N4) and RhB degradation of 1 wt%Fe-SCN was 0.043min(-1) (10 times and 6.83 times higher than pure SnO2 and pure g-C3N4, respectively). It was found that Fe doping reduced the band gap of Fe-SnO2, and formed Z-scheme heterojunction between Fe doped SnO2 (Fe-SnO2) and g-C3N4, which effectively promoted the separation of photogenerated electrons and holes. Moreover, the 1 wt%Fe-SCN composite had a layered structure with large surface area, which increased the contact area with pollutants and improved the photocatalytic activity.

The objective of the present study was to evaluate the potential of cold plasma (CP) treatment as decontamination technology for packaged paocai. By comparing with heat pasteurization, the effect of CP on microbial, physicochemical and organoleptic properties of paocai during storage was investigated. Results showed that CP efficiently eliminated yeasts, especially gas-producing yeast, while allowing retention of lactic acid bacteria. Compared with pasteurization at 70 degrees C for 30 min which eliminated 5.00 logCFU/g of microorganisms, more reducing sugar was consumed by CP-treated paocai, leading to the increase of total acid content by 72.34% and a lower pH at 3.98 after storage of 7 days. Additionally, nitrite content in CP group was 48.54% lower than that of control and was 22.22% higher than that of pasteurization group, with no significant effect on salt content and amino acid nitrogen. As for organoleptic property, firmness and b* value of CP treated samples was 12.53% higher and 26.26% lower than those of pasteurization group after storage, respectively, indicating that CP could alleviate the softening and browning of paocai. Therefore, compared with control, CP could improve the storage stability of packaged paocai, meanwhile achieving similar safety quality as pasteurization, highlighting its potential in preserving packaged fermented vegetables.

Using continuous statistical data from the mountains of Southwest China, we examined the structure, changes and regional differences in agricultural cultivation under urbanization, analyzed the reasons for the restructuring of agricultural cultivation, and revealed the adaptation linkages between the rural-urban transition and agricultural restructuring. The results showed that land-use changes and rural migration caused by urbanization significantly affected the cultivation structure and its change trends: the proportion of food crops decreased, while the proportion of vegetables and orchards increased. However, regional differences in the agricultural cultivation structure were significant in the various township zones. Rural migration weakened agricultural cultivation in the lake basin and nationality townships but enhanced agricultural cultivation in the river valley townships. On the basis of the adaptation linkages of urbanization, rural migration, agricultural intensification, cultivation structure and economic development, chain-type changes and adaptation processes between rural migration and agricultural restructuring were demonstrated. These findings indicate that favorable locations and appropriate policies can promote the integration and restructuring of smallholder agriculture for commercialization and intensification and vice versa.

Increasing the supply of ecosystem services (ESs) in important ecological regions through land use optimization is one strategy that must be seriously considered in land use planning. However, existing land use optimization primarily focuses on economic outcomes, and is difficult to adapt to the practical needs of ecological civilization construction in China. Therefore, we formulated a framework that links ESs to land use decisions by combining policy analyses, multi-scenarios and integrated modelling. The paper is organized into three main parts. First, we conduct a systematic literature review to land use change (LUCC), ESs, and their relationship. Next, we build on insights from the literature review to develop a conceptual framework that integrates ESs into land use optimization. The framework includes a quantitative analysis and spatial allocation of land use. For the quantitative analysis, in addition to considering the development trends, we set ESs to achieve national requirements. Then, an optimized scenario targeted at the maximum ecosystem service value was built. For the spatial allocation, we combined multi-layer perception (MLP) and cellular automaton (CA) and developed an MLP-CA model independently. Last, an empirical study of the proposed framework was implemented in Puge County, China. Our results provide a new technical tool for the layout of optimal land use under the constraint of ecological protection policies and provides a way to address trade-offs between ecological, social, and economic values.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is an aggressive tumor; however, patients with liver cancer that received musk were reported to live longer and have a higher quality of life. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate whether muscone, a macrocyclic compound of musk, demonstrated potential as an anti-liver cancer drug for the non-surgical treatment of advanced liver cancer. Briefly, liver cancer cells were treated with muscone and the rates of cellular apoptosis and autophagy were investigated using staining techniques and western blotting. The underlying molecular mechanisms of muscone were evaluated using high-throughput sequencing and the in vitro effects of muscone were subsequently validated in vivo using a nude mouse model. Muscone increased the rates of apoptosis and autophagy in liver cancer cells; the increase in cellular apoptosis was observed to occur through endoplasmic reticulum stress responses, whereas muscone-induced autophagy was closely associated with the AMP kinase/mTOR complex 1 signaling pathway. These findings were verified in vivo. Notably, sestrin-2 expression levels were also significantly decreased in liver cancer tissues compared with paracancerous tissues. In conclusion, the present study suggests that muscone demonstrates potential as an anticancer drug, and the findings of the present study provide the basis for the development of effective anticancer drugs derived from natural compounds.

The treatment efficacy and degradation characteristics of refractory organics in the wastewater and the improvement in biodegradability were studied. The catalytic capacity of FeS was determined and the electrical energy consumption of the MW-FeS/PS process was evaluated. The MW-FeS/PS process exhibited a more rapid reaction rate (0.208 mg L-1 min(-1)) and a higher chemical oxygen demand reduction (76.16%) compared to other controlled processes under the optimized conditions of initial pH = 3.0, PS dosage = 6 g L-1, FeS dosage = 0.4 g L-1, MW power = 450 W, and reaction time = 16 min. Additionally, biodegradability was greatly improved from an initial value of 0.040 for raw wastewater to 0.487 for treated wastewater. Spectral analysis indicated that benzene-ring substances, nitro group substances, and diazo group substances in the wastewater from explosives production containing DDNP were considerably degraded by the MW-FeS/PS process. After several operation cycles, FeS maintained high catalytic capacity. After reaction, the used FeS showed a larger specific surface area and adsorption aperture, and stronger magnetism, which enhanced the treatment efficiency of the MW-FeS/PS process and facilitated separation of the catalyst from the wastewater. Radical quenching experiments showed that sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals both considerably contributed to organics degradation in the MW-FeS/PS process. In addition, the MW-FeS/PS process consumed less energy than other processes and achieved higher treatment efficacy, confirming that the MW-FeS/PS process is a highly efficient method for treating wastewater from explosives production.

It has numerous seismic activities which have enormous impact on human's life. It is of importance to study the spatio-temporal characteristics of the Eurasian seismic belt. As we can learn from previous studies, fractal and fractal dimension theories can be used to study seismic activities. In general, the temporal sequence and the spatio sequence of earthquakes both exhibit the fractal structures. When huge earthquakes occur, the fractal dimension of the temporal sequence is very low. As the days went by, the value of fractal dimension fluctuates. The seismic data from 1973 to 2014 in The Eurasian seismic belt are selected as the object of this study. Based on the single fractal model, the complex structure of the seismic spatio and temporal distribution in the seismic belt is quantitatively evaluated. Results show that over time the time interval of the seismic activity shortened, and the seismic activity on the Eurasian seismic belt has a nonlinear structure and self-similar characteristics. From the perspective of space, the fractal dimension of the Eurasian seismic belt tends to grow with time, and it also has a nonlinear structure and self-similar characteristics.

First, we give some conditions for bounding the fractal dimension of a random invariant set of non-autonomous random dynamical system. Second, we derive uniform estimates of solutions and establish the existence and uniqueness of tempered pullback random attractors for the equation in H. At last, we prove the finiteness of fractal dimension of random attractors.

However, little is known about UVA distributions in street dust and the risks they pose to human health. We determined the concentrations of 12 UVAs in street dust from cultural, residential, traffic, and industrial areas in Hefei, China. 4-Methylbenzylidene camphor was not detected in the street dust samples. The total concentration range of the 11 other UVAs (Eii UVAs) in the street dust samples was 6.42-94.2 ng/g. Octocrylene was the dominant UVA, contributing 53.8 % of the Sigma(11) UVA concentrations. The UVA concentrations were higher in dust from the industrial area than in dust from cultural, residential, and traffic areas. Source analysis was performed, and industrial activities and the use of cosmetics and personal care products were found to be the main sources of UVAs in street dust. The health risks posed to humans exposed to UVAs in street dust in Hefei were generally low. More research is required to improve our understanding of the health risks posed to humans exposed to UVAs through other pathways. (C) 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers.

We have performed a series of molecular dynamics simulations of KBF4 and NaBF4 aqueous solutions at concentrations ranging from 0.5 M to 2.5 M to investigate the solvation kinetics of ions. It has been found that the difference in solubility between KBF4 and NaBF4 depends on the direct interaction of ions with water molecules in the first hydrated shell. On average, water molecules spend more time in the immediate vicinity of Na+ ions than in the immediate vicinity of K+ ions and BF(4)(- )ions have more likely to form a contact ion pair with K+ ions. The static dielectric constant of KBF4 and NaBF4 aqueous solutions decreases and the dielectric relaxation time increases. The tetrahedral structure of water was found to exhibit varying degrees of distortion with the ion concentration of the solution studied herein. These findings highlight the importance of the first hydrated shell under solubility mechanism for KBF4 and NaBF4. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Previous studies have revealed that oxytocin (OXT) increases orienting to the eye region of face. However, little has been known about the effect of OXT in men and women on the perception of gaze direction particularly when associated with different emotions. Objectives We investigated how oxytocin would affect gaze direction judgments for threatening, angry, and neutral facial expressions and whether this effect would be modulated by observers' sex. Methods We used the cone of direct gaze (CoDG) task. Participants were required to judge the gaze direction of face between directed and averted gaze. Results Results showed opposing sex-dependent effects of OXT such that OXT, as compared with placebo, tended to decrease the CoDG in men but increase it in women. The CoDG was marginally wider in men than in women in the placebo condition, and however, this difference was abolished following OXT treatment. We also found that the perception of gaze direction varied as a function of emotional expression such that the CoDG for angry and neutral faces was wider than that for fearful faces and the CoDG for angry faces was marginally wider than that for neutral ones. However, there was no significant interaction between treatment and facial expression. Conclusions Our findings provide the first evidence for sex-dependent effects of OXT on gaze direction perception, suggesting that OXT attenuates the self-referential judgment of gaze directions of others in men and enhances it in women despite differentiated emotions of faces.

The organics degradation effect of MW output power, oxidant dosage and initial pH were investigated. Spectral analysis and radical scavenging experiments were used to investigate the degradation pathway and identify reactive oxygen species in the two systems. As the MW output power increased, k(obs) of both systems increased, but excessively high-power output inhibited organics degradation in the MW-PS system. The impact of initial pH on MW-PS system performance was not obvious compared to that of the MW-H2O2 system (in which alkalinity significantly limited the reaction with organics). Under the same reaction condition, COD removals reached 89.89% (MW-PS) and 54.56% (MW-H2O2) and biodegradability improved from 0.060 to 0.561 (MW-PS) and 0.535 (MW-H2O2). In addition, SO4 center dot and center dot OH were identified in the MW-PS system but only center dot OH(center dot)existed in the MW-H2O2 system, indicating that the MW-PS system could oxidize more types of organics in DDNP wastewater than the MW-H2O2 system. Furthermore, UV-Vis and FITR analyses showed that organics with diazo groups and nitro-groups could be decomposed and intermediate products with C-O-H (which are biodegradable) will be generated. The MW-PS system also produced a better economic benefit than the MW-H2O2 system. Therefore, this study provides valuable references for the use of MW irradiation-activated oxidants to treat DDNP industrial wastewater. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The influences of N-doping on microstructures and electrochemical performances of MnCO3 microcrystal have been investigated systematically. A plausible mechanism for the in-situ N-doping in MnCO3 also has been proposed. It is found that nitrogen was successfully doped into the MnCO3 by the substitution of lattice oxygen, generating a specific defect structure with oxygen vacancies and narrowing the band gap of MnCO3 effectively from 5.021 to 3.885 eV. When used as anode material, the as-obtained N-doped MnCO3 exhibits outstanding electrochemical performances: it delivers a large capacity of 685 mAh g(-1) after 600 cycles at 1 C; exhibits a superior high-rate performance and long-term stability with a high capacity of 437 mAh g(-1) even after 1000 cycles at a very large current rate of 5 C. Compared with the pristine MnCO3, such the outstanding electrochemical performances of N-doped MnCO3 should be attributed to the specific defect structure provided by N-doping, which can not only create more active sites for lithium storage, but also improve the poor electronic conductivity of MnCO3. This work can offer an effective and facile strategy to realize in-situ N-doping by wet chemical synthesis route, as well as enhance the electrochemical performances of transition metal carbonates.

These new kagome-like phases are intrinsic indirect-gap semiconductors with appropriate band gaps of around 1.6-1.9 eV and demonstrate excellent optical response in the visible light range. More importantly, the band gaps can be flexibly regulated via strain engineering, and an indirect-direct band gap transition can be achieved. The underlying mechanism of this transition is further revealed based on the bonding nature of the near-band-edge electronic orbitals. In addition, the rich gap structure for nanoribbons with zigzag and armchair shaped edges is obtained. Such rich and tunable electronic structures with remarkable anisotropy in kagome-like group-VA materials could pave the way for transistors with high on/off ratios, optoelectronic devices and mechanical sensors based on new 2D crystals.

J	Zhang, YW				Zhang, Yuanwei			Quadratic optomechanical coupling in an active-passive-cavity system	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							PARITY-TIME SYMMETRY; MOTION	We investigate an active-passive-cavity system where a membrane is quadratically coupled to the passive cavity. When the passive cavity is strong coherently driven to enhance the optomechanical coupling, the optical field interacts with the mechanical oscillator through the two-phonon process. By calculating the eigenfrequencies of system in Keldysh framework, we show the significant splitting of exceptional point in the presence of the optomechanical coupling. We also calculate the transmission rate to show how this system responds to an additional weak probe field. We find the gain effect will induce the two-phonon process amplification window. However, the gain effect becomes weak when the photon-tunneling strength increases. Then the transmission rate of the probe field changes from amplification to absorption. These results have potential applications in quantum metrology, quantum information processing, and quantum optical devices.

Here, we reported a facile and efficient approach to tune the catalytic performance for NaBH4 hydrolysis with Co-based catalysts prepared by using cobalt sulfate as a precursor or a mixture of sulfur-containing sodium salts/cobalt salts as a raw material. With the use of cobalt sulfate as the precursor, the CoSO4-doped Co3O4 sample was formed and it exhibited excellent activity with the generation of similar to 500 mL of hydrogen gas from NaBH4 hydrolysis under mild conditions. In terms of sulfur-free cobalt salts (e.g., cobalt chloride, cobalt nitrate, and cobalt acetate) as precursors, the obtained Co-based samples were found to be entirely ineffective for hydrogen production. Interestingly, during the cobalt-based catalyst preparation, the introduction of sodium sulfate or sodium sulfide can considerably accelerate hydrogen production. On the contrary, adding sulfur-bearing salts did not inspire any activity improvement only during the hydrogen generation reaction. Control experiments indicate that during catalyst preparation, the presence of Na2SO4 and Na2S is beneficial for the in situ transformation of Co3O4 into catalytically active Co-B alloys, accompanying a positive change in surface morphology during the NaBH4 hydrolysis, thereby inducing an excellent hydrogen generation rate of up to 4425 mL.min(-1).g(cat)(-1).

To explore effects and potential mechanisms of it, extracts of Z. bungeanum through water (WEZ), volatile oil (VOZ), petroleum ether (PEZ), and methylene chloride (MCZ) were used to treat the memory loss induced in D-galactose-induced aging mice. The impaired memory was significantly alleviated after WEZ and VOZ extract treatment. WEZ and VOZ extracts also prevented D-galactose-induced hippocampal neuron damage. In addition, WEZ and VOZ extracts upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which suggests that the effects of WEZ and VOZ extracts on oxidative stress and apoptosis might be involved in the cognitive dysfunctions. Furthermore, WEZ and VOZ extracts enhanced the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), which suggests that Z. bungeanum has an appreciable therapeutic effect on learning and memory disabilities, and its mechanism may be related to activate PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Collectively, our study suggested that Z. bungeanum extracts are promising agents for prevention of aging-related cognitive dysfunction and neurological deficits.

Suppose that the nil radical Nil(R) of R is a divided prime ideal. Then phi-torsion free modules and phi-projective modules are introduced and it is shown that a finitely generated nonnil ideal I is phi-invertible if and only if I is phi-projective as R-module. So R is a phi-Prufer ring if and only if each finitely generated nonnil ideal of R is phi-projective.

In this paper, the degradation mechanism of ONZ on anatase TiO2(101) and (001) surfaces in vacuum and neutral aqueous solution was elucidated at the DFT level. We found that ONZ was activated and oxidized after being adsorbed on the surface of TiO2; the C-N bond became longer, making the ring-opening degradation more likely to occur. This study found that the degradation of ONZ is more probable on the surface of TiO2(001) than on TiO2(101). When the surroundings of the reaction was changed from a vacuum to aqueous solution, the activation energy of ONZ degradation reaction on TiO2 surfaces was decreased, which indicated that the solvent condition was more favorable for ONZ degradation.

J	Li, TJ; Cao, XX; Tang, SH; He, L; Meng, CM				Li Tian-Jing; Cao Xiu-Xia; Tang Shi-Hui; He Lin; Meng Chuan-Min			Crystal-orientation effects of the optical extinction in shocked Al2O3: a first-principles investigation	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						sapphires; high pressure; shock-induced optical extinction; crystal-orientation effects; first-principles calculations	HIGH-PRESSURE PHASE; ELECTRICAL-CONDUCTIVITY; ALUMINA; LIF; GPA	Sapphires (Al2O3) is an important ceramic material with extensive applications in high-pressure technology and geoscience. For instance, it is often used as a window material in shock-wave experiments. Consequently, understanding the behavior of its transparency change under shock compression is crucial for correctly interpreting the experimental data. Sapphire has excellent transparency at ambient conditions, but its transparency is reduced under shock loading. This shock-induced optical extinction phenomenon in Al2O3 has been studied experimentally and theoretically a lot at present, but the knowledge on the crystal-orientation effects of the extinction is still insufficient. the experimental investigations at low-pressure region (within 86 GPa) have indicated that the shock-induced extinction in Al2O3 is related to its crystal orientation, but it is not clear whether the correlation also exists at high-pressure region (similar to 131 -255 GPa). Here, to investigate this question, we have performed first principles calculations of the optical absorption properties of a-, c-, d-, r-, n-, s-, g- and m-oriented Al2O3 crystals without and with (the +2 charged O vacancy) defects at the pressure range of 131 -255 GPa. It is found that: 1) there are obvious crystal-orientation effects of the extinction in shocked Al2O3 at high-pressure region, and they strengthen with increasing pressure; 2) shock-induced defects could play an important role in determining these crystal-orientation effects, but the influences of pressure and temperature factors on them are relatively weak. A further analysis shows that, at the wavelength range adopted in shock experiments, the extinction of a-orientation is the weakest (the best transparency), the extinction of c-orientation is the strongest (the worst transparency), and the extinction of s-orientation is between them; at the same time, the extinction of m-orientation is similar to that of a-orientation, the extinction of r-, n- and d-orientations is close to that of c-orientation, and the extinction of g-orientation is weaker than that of s-orientation. In view of this, we suggest that the a- or m-oriented Al2O3 is chosen as an optical window in shock-wave experiments of the high-pressure region. Our predictions could be not only helpful to understand further the optical properties of Al2O3 at extreme conditions, but also important for future experimental study.

The present study examined how gender role moderates sex differences in emotional reactivity. Event-related potentials (ERP) were recorded in sixty-eight subjects with typical or androgynous gender roles when they passively observed neutral and negative pictures. Behaviorally, typical females (feminine females) reported higher emotional rating than typical males (masculine males), while androgynous males and androgynous females reported no significant differences. Electrophysiologically, we found higher late positive potential (LPP) amplitude in typical females compared to typical males, while this pattern of sex difference was absent in androgynous subjects. The network analysis of EEG data indicates that typical males showed enhanced network coupling strengths between frontal/prefrontal and parietal areas than typical females, which was again absent in androgynous subjects. These findings suggest that gender role is an important determinant in the interpretation of sex differences in emotional reactivity.

The characterization results showed that iron existed as Fe2O3 and Fe3O4. Partial nitrogen atoms in the frame of g-C3N4 were substituted by sulfur atoms. FeOy/S-g-C3N4 can effectively activate PMS to produce sulfate radicals, hydroxyl radicals and singlet oxygen contributing to the SMX degradation. According to the density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the co-doping of iron and sulfur altered the charge density and its distribution of g-C3N4 surface, which enhanced the PMS activation. The effect of initial concentrations of SMX and PMS, pH, temperature and inorganic ion concentrations on SMX degradation was investigated. 0.8 mM of PMS could degrade up to 10 mg/L of SMX. The initial pH had no obvious effect on the SMX degradation. Higher temperature accelerated the SMX degradation, and the activation energy was calculated to be 43.7 kJ/mol. The effect of inorganic ions was dependent on their initial concentration. Based on the comparison of XPS spectrum before and after reaction, the decreased catalytic activity of FeOy/S-g-C3N4 after five cycle reuse was due to the breakdown of surface functional groups. Seven intermediate products were identified, and the possible degradation pathway was proposed. This study could provide a facile and cost-effective method to synthesize the efficient activator of PMS, and a mechanistic insight into PMS activation by FeOy/S-g-C3N4 for the degradation of emerging pollutants in water and wastewater.

Remarkably, it is the first paper in which the LMI-based criterion of input-to-state stability of time-delays high-order reaction-diffusion neural networks with event-triggered control is derived, in which the diffusion item plays its role. Not similarly as those of previous literature, the sufficient conditions of the main result in this paper are not involved to Lyapunov function, which implies that the conditions of this paper is easier to be verified than ever. With the help of computer Matlab LMI toolbox, a numerical example illustrates the effectiveness of proposed methods. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Effective manipulation of the skyrmion motion is a vital task for realizing skyrmion-based applications. Skyrmion motion driven by voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) has been proposed, of which the investigation is mostly focused on the dynamics of skyrmions. Here, using micromagnetic simulations we show that antiskyrmions can be effectively driven by the VCMA gradient in the presence of the anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We find that the antiskyrmion shows a transverse motion, i.e., the skyrmion Hall effect, induced by the VCMA gradient. As the skyrmion number of an antiskyrmion is opposite to that of a skyrmion, the anisotropy gradient-induced motion of ferromagnetically coupled skyrmion-antiskyrmion pair and antiferromagnetically coupled skyrmion-skyrmion and antiskyrmion-antiskyrmion pairs do not show the skyrmion Hall effect. We find that the velocity-driving force relations of these three combinations are different. Our results may provide guidelines for building future skyrmion-based information processing applications.

To realize n -hop cyclic joint remote state preparation, we suppose that there are n + 2 subsystems. S-1, S-2 and S-3 constitute a cycle in the first hop. Based on it, S-3, S-4 and S-5 form another cycle as the second hop. Notably, S-3 is an intermediate node used to connect these two hops. Then, we can obtain n cycles (hops) in the same way. Specially, if n + 2 is even, there is no way to constitute n cycles. To solve this problem, we propose two different schemes. Our schemes can realize the cyclic JRSP hop by hop via the intermediate node with n + 2 subsystems. Even without direct quantum channel to connect, these subsystems also can participate in the process of preparation through intermediate nodes. Furthermore, we consider the security of our scheme by analyzing inside attack and outside attack, and we found that the success of outside attack is not affected by the attacking time. Finally, we generalized a formula to calculate the efficiency of bidirectional JRSP, which is also suitable for cyclic JRSP.

The taxonomy of Chinese representatives has been studied primarily based on cursory morphological comparisons and their molecular phylogenetic analyses remain unexplored. In order to understand the phylogeny of this group in China, we estimated the first multilocus phylogeny and conducted species delimitation, including taxon sampling throughout their distribution range. Results We obtained one mitochondrial gene (cytb) ( 1, 134 bp) and three nuclear genes (ApoB, BRCA1, RAG1) ( 2, 170 bp) for 132 samples from 57 localities. Molecular analyses identified at least 14 putative species that occur within two major well-supported groups in China. Polyphyletic C. wuchihensis appears to be composed of two putative species. Two subspecies, C. rapax rapax and C. rapax kurodai should be elevated to full species status. A phylogenetic tree based on mitochondrial gene from Asian Crocidura species showed that the C. rapax rapax is embedded within C. attenuata, making the latter a paraphyletic group. Three strongly supported undescribed species (C. sp.1, C. sp.2 and C. sp.3) are revealed from Zada County of Tibet (Western China), Hongjiang County of Hunan Province (Central China) and Dongyang County of Zhejiang Province (Eastern China), Motuo County of Tibet, respectively. The divergence time estimation suggested that China's Crocidura species began to diversify during the late Pliocene (3.66 Ma) and the Early Pleistocene (2.29 Ma), followed by a series of diversifications through the Pleistocene. Conclusions The cryptic diversity found in this study indicated that the number of species is strongly underestimated under the current taxonomy. We propose that the three undescribed species should be evaluated using extensive taxon sampling and comprehensive morphological and morphometric approaches. Climate change since the late Pliocene and the uplift of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau may result in the diversification and speciation of China's Crocidura species. In short, the underestimated diversity underlines the need for a taxonomic revision of Chinese Crocidura species.

Here, we report a salt template-assisted approach through direct calcination of a mixture of ruthenium oleate precursor and sodium sulfate for one-step synthesis of Ru NCs solidly loaded on the simultaneously formed porous carbon (Ru/PC). In this case, both the salt template of sodium sulfate and one-step approach play key roles in forming surface-clean Ru NCs with good dispersion to supply abundant accessible active sites and constructing a three-dimensional architecture to boost the mass and/or electron transport during applications. Taking advantage of these features, Ru/PC as a catalyst shows excellent activities for electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution with an overpotential of 21 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH and ammonia-borane hydrolysis with a high turnover frequency of 744 min(-1) and a high activity for 4-nitrophenol reduction with a reaction rate of 1.29 min(-1) at room temperature. The catalyst also shows high stability and reusability for the investigated reactions. This study presents a green yet sustainable method to produce supported metal NCs for versatile catalytic applications.

Many studies have examined the role of the land surface temperature (LST) and normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) in changes in soil moisture. Nevertheless, an understanding of the influence of the temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), which combines the LST and the NDVI, on soil moisture remains elusive, including in the transition zone area from the Chengdu Plain region to the Longmen Mountains (TZ). In this study, the TVDI was calculated based on the NDVI and LST, using LANDSAT 8 operational land imager/thermal infrared sensor (OLI/TIRS) images. From the TVDI, regression models were trained by using 96 observation points of in situ soil moisture measurements to calculate the soil moisture in the transition zone. The results revealed that there is a strong and significant negative correlation between the TVDI and the in situ measured soil moisture (P<0.05, r=0.710, R-2=0.504). This indicates that the TVDI can reflect the soil moisture status in the TZ. The overall spatial patterns of soil moisture content were relatively high in the northwestern and central mountainous areas but were relatively low in the southeastern plains. Our study uniquely illustrates the spatial patterns of the relationship between TVDI variability and soil moisture variability in the TZ, western China and provides an approach for using remotely sensed soil moisture to optimise the parameterisation of soils in agricultural water management.

Its adsorption characteristics and mechanism were explored. With large channel (similar to 3.3 nm), high specific surface area (2115 m(2)/g), and high crystallite, TPB-DMTP-COF showed high adsorption capacity (209 mg/g), fast adsorption equilibrium (80 min), and good reusability. Natural pH condition was optimal for its adsorption capacity, while electrostatic repulsion between TPB-DMTP-COF and SMT accounted for the low adsorption performance at acidic or alkaline conditions. According to the DFT method, SMT molecules adsorbed in the pore-sites of COFs via C-H center dot center dot center dot pi inter-action was the predominant and stable adsorption configuration accounting for the efficient removal of SMT in large quantity. This study revealed the great adsorption potential of COFs skeleton itself in the application of environmental remediation.

J	Zhang, XL; Saunders, J				Zhang, Xiaolin; Saunders, John			An Historical Review of Mass Sports Policy Development in China, 1949-2009	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT			English	Review						Mass sports; sports policy; nation building; economic development; policy evolution; policy evaluation		This analysis considers the evolution of China's mass sports policy through four distinct periods between 1949 and 2009. From 1949 to 1957 represented the initial stage which was concurrent with the establishment of 'New China'. In this period, mass sports policies focussed on enhancing fitness for labour and national defence, underpinning a new nationalism. From 1958 to 1976, mass sports policies were viewed as a political tool for social control, contributing to the establishment of the party's absolute leadership and enhancing a sense of esprit de corps and positive teamwork in different departments and areas. From 1977 to 1994, mass sports policy was focussed on the reform of the management system and the construction of a sports culture. From 1995 to 2009, policy moved onwards to equality of opportunity for participation. It is argued that China's mass sports policy has shifted from a unified national perspective to a more human-based standard supported by a variety of policy systems from national to local government. This account shows how mass sports policy has played an active political role in the nation's economic construction and cultural development.

The MABAC (multi-attributive border approximation area comparison) model, which handles the complex and uncertain decision making issues by computing the distance between each alternative and the bored approximation area (BAA), has been investigated by an increasing number of researchers more recent years. In our article, consider the conventional MABAC model and some fundamental theories of q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (q-ROFS), we shall introduce the q-rung orthopair fuzzy MABAC model to solve MADM problems. at first, we briefly review some basic theories related to q-ROFS and conventional MABAC model. Furthermore, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy MABAC model is built and the decision making steps are described. In the end, An actual MADM application has been given to testify this new model and some comparisons between this novel MABAC model and two q-ROFNs aggregation operators are provided to further demonstrate the merits of the q-rung orthopair fuzzy MABAC model.

This paper fully explores the hierarchical cognitive mechanism of visual information, combines color contrast and depth contrast, and puts forward a salient object detection algorithm for the RGB-D image. Three saliency maps were prepared, namely, initial saliency map, middle saliency map and advanced saliency map. The three maps were then fused into a final saliency map. The proposed method was compared with six popular salient object detection methods on three RGB-D image datasets. The comparison shows that our algorithm achieved the best results in accuracy, recall rate and F-value. The research findings shed important new light on salient object detection in RGB-D images.

However, few studies have studied rural and remote mountain areas in China with little known about "farmers' adaptation under the impact of geo-hazards". Unlike traditional farmers' behavioral adaptation studies, in this study, we focused on the resilience of farmers' behavioral mechanisms to address local hazards such as geo-hazards. Our data were acquired through questionnaire responses (N = 516) in mountainous hazard-prone areas in Chongqing, China. The binary logit model and multinomial logit model were used to investigate the obstacles to different farming strategies and the determinants of adaptation strategy choice, focusing on the effects of disaster experience and social support on the adaptation strategy resilience. The results show that the most common adaptation strategy was adjusting crop varieties, and the largest adaptation obstacle was a lack of funds. Additionally, the age of the smallholder, farming acreage, agricultural income, social support, and disaster experience significantly increased the possibility of farmers adjusting their agricultural production. Of these, smallholder agricultural income, state disaster subsidy, the presence of disaster prevention construction, the smallholder's property, and the presence of disaster-caused crop loss experience were the most important factors affecting a farmer's adaptation strategy. In particular, farmers were more sensitive to disaster-caused property loss than to disaster-caused crop loss. This study can provide implications for the government to formulate disaster mitigation measures and for farming strategies at the smallholder level.

The calculated results are carefully compared with each other. The interface anisotropy effect is very palpable on the nucleation, pinning and coercive fields when the soft layer is very thin. However, as the soft layer thickness increases, the pinning and coercive fields are almost unchanged with the increment of interface anisotropy though the nucleation field still monotonically rises. Negative interface anisotropy decreases the maximum energy products and increases slightly the angles between the magnetization and applied field. The magnetic moment distributions in the thickness direction at various applied fields demonstrate a progress of three-step magnetic reversal, i.e., nucleation, evolution and irreversible motion of the domain wall. The above results calculated by two models are in good agreement with each other. Moreover, the in-plane magnetic moment orientations based on two models are different. The 3D calculation shows a progress of generation and disappearance of vortex state, however, the magnetization orientations within the film plane calculated by the 1D model are coherent. Simulation results suggest that negative interface anisotropy is necessarily avoided experimentally.

J	Mao, Y; Yang, SW; Li, ZN; Li, YJ				Mao, Yan; Yang, Shanwen; Li, Zuning; Li, Yongjian			Personality trait and group emotion contagion based crowd simulation for emergency evacuation	MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Emotion contagion; Crowd simulation; Emergency evacuation; Group behavior; Inter-group; Intra-group	MODEL	Most of current crowd simulation methods have considered the impact of interindividual emotion on the agent's behavior pattern during emergency evacuations. However, the emotion contagion is not only at the individual level, but also at the contagion in groups. Psychological researches show that the third-party authority also has an impact on emotion contagion. For example, security guards can guide individuals to find exits and calms them; and teachers can lead their students safely evacuate from multi-layer teaching buildings, etc. In this paper, we propose a unified framework to simulate the emergency evacuations in virtual environment. This framework considers four kinds of agents: third-party authority agents, group leaders, members and isolated agents. Firstly, we randomly assign each agent a specific personality and initialize its emotion. Secondly, the emotion contagion in this paper is considered with three aspects: intra-group contagion, inter-group contagion and third-party authority based emotion contagion. We simulate inter-group aggregated behaviors by improving the ASCRIBE and provide a threshold model to simulate inter-group switching behaviors. The third-party authorities exhibit a calm effect on the agents during an evacuation, and we set their negative emotion very low and keep unchanged. Meanwhile, we perform high-level path planning to explore the environments and obtain a cognitive map for navigation purposes. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, simulation results demonstrate that our proposed model can simulate the emotion contagion in groups during emergency evacuations, and our model outperforms some existing works.

Real-time flood forecasting correction techniques (e.g., proportional correction (PC) and Kalman filter (KF)) coupled with the Muskingum method improve the forecasting performance but have limitations (e.g., short lead times and inadequate performance, respectively). Here, particle filter (PF) and combination forecasting (CF) are coupled with the Muskingum method and then applied to 10 flood events along the Shaxi River, China. Two indexes (overall consistency and permissible range) are selected to compare the performances of PC, KF, PF and CF for 3 h lead time. The changes in overall consistency for different lead times (1-6 h) are used to evaluate the applicability of PC, KF, PF and CF. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) for 3 h lead time, the two indexes indicate that the PF performance is optimal, followed in order by KF and PC; CF performance is close to PF and better than KF. (2) The performance of PC decreases faster than that of KF and PF with increases in the lead time. PC and PF are applicable for short (1-2 h) and long lead times (3-6 h), respectively. CF is applicable for 1-6 h lead times; however, it has no advantage over PC and PF for short and long lead times, respectively, which may be due to insufficient training and increase in cumulative errors.

The mountainous areas in southwest China are backward in economy, but industrialization and urbanization have been rapid in recent years. This study assessed the ecosystem health of the Sichuan and Yunnan provinces in China using a pressure-state-response (PSR) model. Spatiotemporal patterns of regional ecosystem health were analyzed from 2000 to 2016, including overall characteristics as well as local characteristics. Ecosystem health in most regions was improved over time (Y = 0.0058X - 11.0132, R-2 = 0.95, P < 0.001), and areas with poorer ecosystem health decreased from half to one-third of the total area. Analysis of the primacy ratio and the variation coefficient confirmed that the gap in health scores between regions has gradually expanded since 2007, but there are more high quality regions overall (Z of Moran's index < 1.96, P > 0.05). Overall, the regional ecosystems to the east of the Hu line-an imaginary line dividing east and west China into roughly equivalent parts-were healthier than those to the west. The pressure and state scores of ecosystems were determined by physiographic condition, and the response scores by government policies and social concern. The spatiotemporal patterns of ecosystem health were dominated to a greater extent by natural than anthropogenic factors, which explains why the shift in the patterns aligned with the direction of the Hu line. Dividing regions into key management areas based on natural geographical conditions and socioeconomic development could contribute to the formulation of a reasonable ecological and environmental protection policy, guaranteeing ecosystem services in the long run.

As a major Chinese economic development engine, the domestic tourism industry has entered a transition period operation pattern featured by diversified products. Among them, as a new hot spot of the tourism industry in China, ecological tourism has enjoyed rapid development, with great potential. Thus, the ecological value evaluation of forest ecological tourism demonstration areas is very important to the domestic tourism industry. In this paper, we propose some Dombi Heronian mean operators with interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IVIFNs). Then, two MADM (multiple attribute decision making) methods are proposed based on IVIFWDHM (interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy weighted Dombi Heronian mean) and IVIFWDGHM (interval-valued intuitionistic weighted Dombi geometric Heronian mean) operators. Finally, we gave an experimental case for evaluating the ecological value of forest ecological tourism demonstration area to show the proposed decision methods.

However, translocation pattern of nitrogen within clonal network and its horizontal redistribution still remain poorly understood. In the experiment, clonal fragment of the stoloniferous herb Glechoma longituba with four successive ramets was used. The mother rosette was grown in high nitrogen availability patch. The proximal, middle and distal ramets were grown individually in low nitrogen availability patches. Three separate ramets were transplanted into low nitrogen availability patches as neighboring individual for the proximal, middle and distal ramets, respectively. In addition, whole clonal fragment was grown in low nitrogen availability patches as the control treatment. Stolon among interconnected ramets retained intact. Potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) and biomass accumulation of the proximal, middle and distal ramets significantly increased as well as leaf nitrogen content (N-M), chlorophyll content (ACC(m)) and leaf nitrogen allocation to the photosynthetic machinery (P-T) when nitrogen was added to the mother rosette. Compared with the proximal and distal ramets, greater increase of the above-mentioned parameters in the middle ramets is probably a trade-off between cost and benefit of nitrogen translocation. We tentatively conclude that the translocation pattern may be the optimal adaptation strategy for the clonal fragment of Glechoma longituba suffering from heterogeneous nitrogen supply. In the control treatment, all neighboring individuals died out at the end of experiment. However, the neighboring individuals survived when nitrogen was added to the mother rosette. Compared with the neighboring individuals for the proximal and/or distal ramets, N-M, ACC(m), P-max and biomass accumulation of the neighboring individuals for the middle ramets were significantly higher. The horizontal redistribution of nitrogen among patches may be mediated by clonal integration, following by its translocation pattern within clonal network.

Results show that the SPEC experienced a significant decadal change around 2003 demonstrating positive rainfall anomalies over the Yellow-Huai River valley (YHV) and the Yangtze-Huai River valley (CHV), and negative rainfall anomalies over south of the Yangtze River (SYR). Meanwhile, a conspicuous strengthening in the TPSH occured in the early 2000s on a decadal time scale. When the spring TPSH was abnormally strong, there was a stronger atmospheric heat source transferring to the upper layer, inducing an abnormal cyclonic circulation and airflow convergence at the TP surface and an anticyclonic circulation and airflow divergence in the upper layer in the forthcoming summer. It was controlled by mid- to lower- layer southerly and upper-layer northerly wind attributed to the large-scale anticyclonic circulation above the TP over the YHV and CHV. In addition, when the spring TPSH was enhanced, there was a stronger upward air motion due to the positive variations in the diabatic heating and the horizontal temperature advection over the YHV and CHV, which gave rise to positive rainfall amounts over these areas. On the contrary, accompanied by the negative diabatic heating, there was a mid- to lower- layer anticyclonic circulation and cold advection from the neighboring ocean over the SYR. As a result, a stronger downward air motion led to less rainfall in the corresponding area. The results of the CESM sensitivity simulation confirm that when the TPSH was enhanced, the variations in the diabatic heating and the horizontal temperature advection were positive over the YHV and CHV and negative over the SYR, leading to the stronger upward and downward air motions in the corresponding areas, respectively. As a consequence, the SPEC variations show positive rainfall anomalies over the YHV and CHV, and negative anomalies over the SYR.

Using a comparative case study approach, it focuses on two private universities, each with differing institutional histories and forms of governance. It draws on thematic analysis of extensive documentation relating to the governance of private higher education and data from in-depth interviews with 26 senior managers on 38 separate occasions. Through the lenses of principal-agent and stewardship theories, the roles of the Council, as the governing body, and the University Committee, as executive team, in the institutional governance of private universities are explored. The principal features of the two governance forms relating to autonomy and control of shareholders and managers are identified. The paper fills a gap in the study of the institutional governance of Chinese private universities in English literature. As such, it provides insight into practice for policymakers, senior managers, and academics in the field of governance of private universities.

The analytical formulas of the QSS self-focusing of PCLPs in nonlinear media (e.g., the beam width, spatial coherence width, and focal length) are presented. The effect of spatial coherence on the focal length and focus moving is investigated in detail. In particular, it is found that a PCLP has more advantages to avoid the optical damage of materials than a fully coherent light pulse.

In addition, we present a bidirectional quantum dense coding scheme with a control by virtue of the generalized Hadamard transformation. We show how to implement the cyclic quantum dense coding in an arbitrary high dimension where Alice can transfer her encoded messages n(1)m(1) to Bob; meanwhile, Bob can transfer his encoded messages n(2)m(2) to Charlie and Charlie can also transfer his encoded messages n(3)m(3) to Alice in both clockwise and counterclockwise directions. We can also generalize the cyclic scheme to system having n >= 3 agents. Thereby, our scheme can realize dense coding in quantum information networks with n agents in arbitrary directions.

J	Zhang, XY; Tang, X; Yang, JL; Lv, ZY				Zhang, Xianyong; Tang, Xiao; Yang, Jilin; Lv, Zhiying			Quantitative three-way class-specific attribute reducts based on region preservations	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF APPROXIMATE REASONING			English	Article						Rough sets; Probabilistic rough sets; Attribute reduction; Class-specific attribute reducts; Three-way decisions	DECISION-MAKING; UNCERTAINTY MEASURES; ROUGH; ENTROPY	Attribute reduction of rough set theory is effective for intelligent information processing, and class-specific attribute reducts are beneficial for pattern recognition and rule reasoning. According to three-way decisions, class-specific reducts already have three-way types (namely, positive, negative, and positive-negative) of qualitative optimization, which adhere to classical rough sets. In terms of region preservations, there are no corresponding three-way types of quantitative optimization that match probabilistic rough sets. Thus, this paper constructs and investigates quantitative three-way class-specific attribute reducts based on region preservations. First, the uncertainty/nonmonotonicity of quantitative region change is revealed, and it naturally induces the reduction criteria of quantitative region preservations. Then, quantitative three-way class-specific reducts are constructed, and their basic properties regarding their necessary conditions, attribute cores, and reduct algorithms are achieved. Furthermore, their interrelation regarding equivalence and strengthening/balance are obtained for consistent and inconsistent decision classes, respectively, and their expansions for qualitative three-way class-specific reducts are proved. Finally, relevant concepts and obtained results are effectively verified by decision tables and data experiments. By virtue of sure region preservations, quantitative three-way class-specific attribute reducts robustly extend the existing qualitative three-way class-specific reducts and facilitate the optimal identification and quantitative reasoning of class-specific patterns.

This study investigated the enzymes types and possible pathways in the co-metabolic degradation of 3-PBA by Aspergillus oryzae M-4. The enzymes involved in co-metabolic degradation of 3-PBA and its intermediate metabolites were induced, and existed extracellularly and intracellularly except the catechol-degrading enzyme. Inhibitors and inducers of these oxidases were used to examine the enzymes required for co-metabolic degradation of 3-PBA and its intermediate metabolites. 3-PBA is hydroxylated to produce 3-hydroxy-5-phenoxy benzoic acid through the catalytic actions of lignin peroxidase (LiP). Phenol and gallic acid, the metabolites of 3-PBA, are produced via cleavage of an ether bond under the catalytic actions of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and LiP. Phenol can be converted to catechol by LiP; catechol and gallic acid are cleaved to form long-chain olefin acid or olefin aldehyde by dioxygenase and LiP. In corn flour, some of these enzyme activators such as FeCl3, 4-cumaric acid, veratryl alcohol and sodium periodate appeared to improve 3-PBA degradation. The results provide a reliable pathway and characteristics for co-metabolic microbial degradation of 3-PBA in food and the environment.

Nevertheless, the poor cycling stability and low rate capability have hindered their practical applications. Herein, an effective strategy for the rational design of CoS2 nanoparticles embedded in the graphitic structured N-doped porous carbon spheres interlinked by the reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanosheets (rGO-CoS2-GNCSs) is proposed. The interconnected multidimensional nanostructure constructed by CoS2 nanoparticles, graphitic structured N-doped porous carbon spheres and rGO nanosheets can provide a fast transfer pathway for electrons and electrolyte ions, which helps enhance the electric conductivity of the material and facilitate the reaction kinetics in SIBs. Moreover, benefiting from this unique microstructure, the change of the volume during sodiation/desodiation can be effectively alleviated and the stability of the architectural morphology can be enhanced. As a result, the rGO-CoS2-GNCSs used as the anode of SIBs presents an impressive electrochemical performance at a cut-off voltage of 0.4-2.9 V in the electrolyte of 1.0 M NaCF3SO3 in diglyme, delivering a high reversible capacity of 523.9 mAh g(-1) at 100 mA g(-1) after 150 cycles, an excellent rate capability of 423.3 mAh g(-1) at 2 A g(-1) and extraordinary long-term cycling stability of 465.9 mAh g(-1) at 500 mA g(-1) after 600 cycles and 412.2 mAh g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) after 400 cycles. This study puts forward a promising strategy for the rational design of anode materials for high-efficiency sodium storage by interconnecting transition metal compounds, two-dimensional materials and nanocarbon to form multidimensional nanohybrids.

A first series of mesogenic 2-phenylbenzothiophene derivatives (nPBT) was simply and rapidly obtained in good yields by successive demethylation/allcylation reactions of the available methoxy precursor. The further stepwise oxidations moreover resulted in two new sets of the corresponding sulfoxide (nPBTO) and sulfone (nPBTO(2)) derivatives, respectively, that were also mesomorphic. The liquid crystalline behaviour was comprehensively characterized by DSC, POM and SAXS: all compounds exhibit smectic-like behaviour in agreement with their calamitic shape. More specifically, mesogens nPBT showed a SmA phase, with in addition, a higher ordered smectic phase at lower temperature. As for the oxidized mesogens, they displayed a SmA phase only, and over particularly large temperature ranges for the nPBTO with longer chain lengths (n >= 8). The photo-physical properties have also been studied both in solution and thin films, and the molecules were found to display strong absorption in the UV/vis domain and intense luminescence in the range of 400-650 nm (yellowish green light) in high quantum yields (up to 62%). Both absorption and luminescence were also found to be affected by the oxidation of the benzothiophene moiety. Finally, the semi-conducting behaviour of three PBT compounds in the various mesophases was investigated by photocurrent TOF technique. Hole mobility rates of ca. 4 x 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) were measured in the lower temperature ordered mesophase for all of them, with the best performances (temperature range and mobility values) however obtained for the shortest homolog (n = 6). With such highly reasonable mesomorphic, light-emitting and semiconducting functional features, as well as being cheap and easy to synthesize and to process, these materials become very attractive and may be incorporated into various kinds of electronic devices (OFET and OLED).

Thanks to the microplasma-based synthesis method, only 1.5 h the Co(OH)F nano-flower obtained in situ on the carbon cloth under ambient temperature and pressure. As a non-enzymatic sensor, the Co(OH)F NF/CC electrode exhibited good electrocatalytic activity, such as shorter response time (< 5 s), low detection limit (LOD) of 0.75 mu M (S/N= 3) and response sensitivity of 1806 mu AmM-1 cm(-2) with satisfactory reproducibility and selectivity.

Interface layer thickness dependence of magnetic properties of SmCo/Fe exchange-spring multilayers: An analytical micromagnetic approach	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Exchange-spring multilayers; Interface layer; Micromagnetic analysis; Nucleation field; Energy product	COMPOSITE MEDIA; COERCIVITY	Experiments have found that the interface layer formed by the interface atomic diffusion in the SmCo/Fe hard/soft exchange-spring system may improve magnetic properties such as the nucleation field and energy product. One-dimensional (1D) analytical micromagnetics can well explain the underlying physics of this phenomenon. In this paper, the magnetic properties of SmCo/Fe exchange-spring multilayers are studied by an analytical micromagnetic approach, focusing on the effect of the interface layer thickness on demagnetization progress. The equations for the angular distribution of the magnetization in all layers and the interface constraint are first derived analytically. The microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops, the energy product and angular distribution are calculated, with realistic values for the interface layer thickness considered. It is found that as the interface layer thickness increases, the nucleation field rises, the coercivity increases first and then is almost constant, hence the maximum energy product goes up, while the angular distribution and depinning field decrease. The nucleation field rises with the interface layer thickness for a wide region of the interface exchange energy constant, calculated by a three-dimensional (3D) micromagnetic software (OOMMF), which agrees perfectly with 1D calculated results. Meanwhile, the nucleation field goes up with the interface exchange coupling coefficient for any interface layer thickness. Above results indicate that the existence of an interface layer between the soft and hard layers enhances the exchange coupling interaction between them, which is qualitatively consistent with the experiment in [Appl. Phys. Lett. 91, 072509 (2007)], as confirmed via an in-plane 1D model with interface layer.	[Zhao, Q.; He, X. X.; Zhang, X. F.; Zhao, G. P.; Li, Z. B.; Li, L. F.; Liu, Y.

Based on 4-(5-bromothiophen-2-yl)-7-(5-((4-nonyl-5-ethynylthiophen-2-yl) ethynyl)-thiophen-2-yl) benzothiadiazole (A(4)B(7)BT), organic polymer monomers for solar cells are designed, aided by silicon-doping, using density functional theory (DFT) at the GGA/PW91/DNP level. Comparison and screening of stable configuration, stable energy, and frontier orbital energy gap indicate that, A(4)B(7)BT-3Si is the best configuration when the positions of 1, 3, and 5 carbon atoms on the BT unit of A(4)B(7)BT are replaced by 3Si atoms simultaneously. To further explore the photovoltaic (PV) properties of silicon-doped A(4)B(7)BT, DFT and the periodic plane slab model are combined to investigate A(4)B(7)BT-xSi (x = 1-6) adsorbed on the SnO2 (1 0 0) surface. The stable structures, Mulliken charges, frontier orbitals, energy band structures, and density of states are discussed in detail. The results reveal that the energy gap (1.17 eV) in SnO2 (1 0 0)-A(4)B(7)BT-3Si is close to that of single-crystal Si. This study potentially guides the strategic development of future PV materials.

The KNCNF-0 ceramic without F doping has the highest level of oxygen vacancies and defect complexes. However, as the level of F increases, the contents of oxygen vacancies and defect complexes decrease correspondingly, and thus, the evolution of hardening to softening behaviors in the ceramics is observed. As a result, the KNCNF-0 piezoceramic shows extremely hardened electrical behaviors (a completely constricted P-E hysteresis loop, large E-i of 10.7 kV cm(-1), k(p) of 38%, d(33) of 83 pC N-1, Q(m) of 3110, and tan delta of 0.2%), while the ceramic with x = 0.28 exhibits softened ferroelectric and piezoelectric characteristics (a non-shrinking P-E hysteresis loop, declining E-i of 7.5 kV cm(-1), enhanced k(p) of 42%, optimized d(33) of 103 pC N-1, reduced Q(m) of 1031, and increased tan delta of 0.6%). This study provides new insights into the modulation of defects and electrical performance of KNN ceramics.

Long-term consumption of high fluoride tea products could result in chronic fluoride intoxication. Confining the fluoride in the earth with absorbents to reduce the fluoride accumulation of the tea trees during the growth period which could radically control the fluoride level in tea product. Humic acid (HA), a kind of organic matter in the earth was used as raw material to prepare adsorbent aluminum humate (HAA) by aluminum modification. The HAA absorbent presented excellent absorption performance to the fluoride in a wide pH range (4-10), and the maximum adsorptive capacity can reach to 62.5 mg/g. The absorption isotherm demonstrated the adsorption of fluoride was the monomolecular adsorption and the absorption was in accordance with the pseudo-second order kinetic equation. Fluoride content in real soil solution decreased significantly by 53.03% by using the HAA absorbent. The utilization of HAA adsorbent in the culture and field plots experiments also obviously adsorb the soluble fluoride in solution and soil, which could significantly suppress the fluoride accumulation in tea leaves. In September, the fluoride accumulation in tea leaves has been reduced 74.29% in the field plots experiments.

The controllable creation and manipulation of bimerons are crucial for practical applications based on topological spin textures. Here, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic bimeron driven by a spin current. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the spin current can create an isolated bimeron in the antiferromagnetic thin film via the dampinglike spin torque. The spin current can also effectively drive the antiferromagnetic bimeron without a transverse drift. The steady motion of an antiferromagnetic bimeron is analytically derived and is in good agreement with the simulation results. Also, we find that the alternating-current-induced motion of the antiferromagnetic bimeron can be described by the Duffing equation due to the presence of the nonlinear boundary-induced force. The associated chaotic behavior of the bimeron is analyzed in terms of the Lyapunov exponents. Our results demonstrate the inertial dynamics of an antiferromagnetic bimeron, and may provide useful guidelines for building future bimeron-based spintronic devices.

The GaSe/MoS2 heterostructure exhibits a broadband photoresponse covering the range of visible to near-infrared spectra at room temperature without external bias voltage. When ITO serves as contact electrodes, a high rectification ratio, i.e., 1.5 x 10(4) at V-DS = +/- 1 V, and an excellent photoelectric performance, i.e., responsivity of approximate to 0.67 A W-1, specific detectivity of approximate to 2.3 x 10(11) cm Hz(1/2) W-1 and external quantum efficiency of approximate to 160% at the wavelength of 520 nm is achieved. Moreover, the GaSe/MoS2 heterostructure with Ohmic-contact ITO electrodes demonstrates a faster response time of 155 mu s, which is 4 times faster than the GaSe/MoS2 heterostructure with Ni/Au electrodes and about 300 times faster than previous reports. These results reveal the presence of an abrupt p-n junction between GaSe and MoS2 and significant role of electrode-contact mode in determining the photoelectric properties of GaSe/MoS2 heterostructure.

Self-report questionnaires assessing coping style, disordered eating, and depression were completed in 646 Chinese female undergraduates. The results illustrated that there were obvious differences in disordered eating among the undergraduates with various majors. The disordered eating in female undergraduates majoring in art was more serious than those in other majors. Depression and coping style were effective indicators to predict disordered eating. Moreover, depression could not only directly predict disordered eating, but also predict disordered eating through the mediating effect of coping style. These findings indicate that depression and negative coping style are associated with disordered eating. Coping style could mediate the effect of depression on disordered eating, as these may be an important target for early intervention programs for eating disorder (ED).

The TME is so far the primary approach to studying Coulomb drag in the weak-coupling regime; however, its accuracy and reliability remain unexplored. Here, we evaluate the performance of the TME for Coulomb drag via a comparison with numerically exact results obtained by the hierarchical equation-of-motion approach. We find that the TME can capture qualitative current evolutions versus dot levels, temperature, and effective coupling strengths but only partially succeeds at the quantitative level. Specifically, the TME gives highly inaccurate drag currents when large charge fluctuations on dots exist and the fourth-order tunneling processes make a leading-order contribution. This failure of the TME is attributed to the combined effect of the unique drag mechanisms and its overlook of the fourth-order single-electron tunnelings. We identify the reliable regions to facilitate further quantitative studies on Coulomb drag by the TME.

As 1,3-dienes are readily available from industrial cracking processes, there is great interest in the development of sustainable methods for the functionalization of these simple molecules. Although initial developments in this field have required precious-transition-metal catalysts, there has been a push toward the use of inexpensive, nontoxic, and more abundant copper catalysts to promote functionalization. This Perspective covers the many developments in the area of copper-catalyzed functionalization of 1,3-dienes, in particular hydrofunctionalization, borofunctionalization, and difunctionalization (e.g., diamination).

In order to get insight into the individual protease involved in keratin hydrolysis, a keratinase designed as BsKER71 was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis WB600. In silico analysis revealed that BsKER71 protein contained a mature protein of 36.1 kDa. Further, purified BsKER71 could hydrolyze a variety of natural proteins, such as fibrous protein, collagen protein, casein, keratin and bovine serum albumin. In addition, this keratinase exhibited high enzyme activity in a wide range of pH and optimal pH of 10.0 and 9.0 in the hydrolysis of casein and keratin, respectively. Similarly, the optimal temperature was 55 degrees C and 50 degrees C for the hydrolysis of above two substrates, respectively. The hydrolytic activity was significantly inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), indicating the presence of serine residue in the active site. Moreover, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and phenanthroline moderately inhibited the hydrolytic activity. The catalytic activity was stimulated by Mg2+ and Ca2+, but greatly inhibited by Cu2+. Furthermore, several chemicals exhibited different effects on the hydrolysis of casein and keratin by BsKER71. These results provided a better understanding of BsKER71 from feather degrading bacterium B. subtilis S1-4.

The Ising-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC) results in spin-momentum locking perpendicular to the two-dimensional crystal near the K and -K valleys, strongly protecting the superconducting state against in-plane magnetic fields. In this work, we theoretically study the Kondo effect of a magnetic impurity doped in monolayer TMDs with the Ising SOC protected superconducting state. Based on behaviors of spin-induced Yu-Shiba-Rusinov bound states and localized magnetic susceptibility, we show that the Ising SOC plays an important role in enhancing or suppressing the Kondo screening of the magnetic impurity, depending on the relative position of the Fermi level with respect to the Ising splitting. More importantly, the Ising SOC exhibits opposite influences on the quantum phase transition between magnetic doublet and Kondo singlet ground states in electron- and hole-doped cases. These features in Kondo screening can be tuned by ionic liquid-gating in experiments.

Here, we prepared a CoS and MnO2 composite electrode (MnO2-x@CoS) with a core-shell structure by coating CoS on the MnO2-x arrays with a simple electrodeposition method. Both the oxygen vacancies of MnO2-x generated at a high temperature and the metallic CoS coating increase the electronic conductivity of the composite electrode. The high surface area of the composite electrode also provides enough active electrochemical sites for the supercapattery. The prepared MnO2-x@CoS has a high specific capacitance of 781.1 C g(-1) at 2 mA cm(-2). A supercapattery (SCT) with MnO2-x@CoS composite electrode shows a high areal capacitance of 1064 mF cm(-2) and a high energy density of 34.72 Wh kg(-1) at 597.24 W kg(-1). Besides, the SCT displays excellent cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 89.6% after 9000 cycles. These superior electrochemical properties of the present materials are comparable to those of state-of-the-art MnO2 based electrodes for supercapattery.

Here, we reported a novel hybrid nanocatalyst comprised of Rh nanoclusters (1.56 nm in diameters) anchored on nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanotubes with embedded Ni nanoparticles (Ni@NCNTs), which was fabricated through adsorption of Rh ions on Ni@NCNTs. The achieved hybrid of Rh/Ni@NCNTs displayed excellent catalytic property (Turnover frequency: 959 min(-1)) toward AB hydrolysis, higher than many prior developed Rh-based catalysts. Note that this hybrid could be reused for at least nine runs with complete AB conversion to hydrogen. Rh nanoclusters with small size exhibiting high atom utilization and the synergetic effect between Ni and Rh are responsible for the excellent catalytic property of Rh/Ni@NCNTs toward AB hydrolysis. This work highlights the importance of utilization of magnetically recyclable Ni@NCNTs as support and synergetic component for efficient hydrolysis of AB. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

Nevertheless, these orbital-dependent many-body effects have mainly been observed in bulk materials, wherein the electrons' orbital attribute is challenging to tailor selectively. Here, by planar tunneling into the two-dimensional electron system (2DES) at the LaAlO3/SrTiO3 interface, we observed a Kondo resonance, a model many-body phenomenon. The observation of the Kondo resonance provides an ideal opportunity to quantitatively exploit the emerging interfacial Kondo physics. Furthermore, it was found that the Kondo coupling strength and resonance line shape can be effectively regulated by electrostatic gating and show a sharp transition at the Lifshitz point, where the orbital occupancy of the 2DES changes from only d(xy) to both d(xy) and d(xy/yz). This unusual behavior is attributed to the orbital selectivity effect in this unique multiple-d-band system, wherein the itinerant d(xy) and d(xy/yz) electrons have different orbital symmetries and therefore different Kondo exchange coupling with the localized d(xy) electrons. The present study may pave the way for manipulating many-body effects in 2D multiband materials via orbital engineering of itinerant electrons.

The results show that tinidazole can adsorb on the surfaces of TiO2(101) and (001) under different conditions. The hydrogen bond generated during the adsorption process can enhance the stability of the adsorption configuration, which makes the bond length of C-N of tinidazole longer and finally facilitates the ring-opening degradation reaction. As for the mechanism of the ring-opening degradation reaction, it was found that ring-opening can be carried out along reaction route II on both crystal surfaces, and the reaction activation energy is lower on (101) surface. Under the conditions of aqueous solution, the decrease of the activation energy of the ring-opening degradation reaction indicates that the solvent conditions can promote the degradation reaction.

However, the past researchers were usually based on the overall time-domain evolution information of PM2.5. Since the temporal evolution of PM2.5 concentration is nonstationary, previous studies might neglect some important localization features that the evolution has various predominant periods at different scales. Therefore, we applied the wavelet transform to study the localized intermittent oscillations of PM2.5. First, we analyze the daily average PM2.5 concentration collected from the automatic monitoring stations. The result reveals that the predominant oscillation period does vary with time. There exist multiple oscillation periods on the scale of 14-32 d, 62-104 d, 105-178 d and 216-389 d and the 298d is the first dominant period in the entire evolutionary process. Moreover, we want to figure out whether the temporal characteristics of PM2.5 in the days with heavy haze also have localized intermittent periodicities. We select the hourly average PM2.5 concentration in 120 h when the haze pollution is serious. We find that the principal period has experienced two abrupt shifts and the energy at the 63-hour scale is the most powerful. The results in these two independent analyses come into the same conclusion that the multiscale features shown in the temporal evolution of PM2.5 cannot be ignored and may play an important role in the further haze prediction.

Examination of the clonal composition of an individual tumor and its evolution through disease progression and treatment may enable identification of precise therapeutic targets for drug design. Multi-region and single-cell sequencing are powerful tools that can be used to capture intratumor heterogeneity. Here, we present a database we've named CancerTracer (http://cailab.labshare.cn/cancertracer): a manually curated database designed to track and characterize the evolutionary trajectories of tumor growth in individual patients. We collected over 6000 tumor samples from 1548 patients corresponding to 45 different types of cancer. Patient-specific tumor phylogenetic trees were constructed based on somatic mutations or copy number alterations identified in multiple biopsies. Using the structured heterogeneity data, researchers can identify common driver events shared by all tumor regions, and the heterogeneous somatic events present in different regions of a tumor of interest. The database can also be used to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between primary and metastatic tumors. It is our hope that CancerTracer will significantly improve our understanding of the evolutionary histories of tumors, and may facilitate the identification of predictive biomarkers for personalized cancer therapies.

In this paper, a Co/Fe-imidazole-based bimetal-organic framework nanosheet array grown on a nickel foam [MIL-53(Co-Fe)/NF] was prepared via a facile solvothermal process. Surprisingly, MIL-53(Co-Fe)/NF shows excellent OER activity with overpotential as low as 262 mV at 100 mA cm(-2), much lower than those of the single metal-based MOFs, and even comparable to that of the precious RuO2. The results indicate that the synergetic effect of co-doped Fe and Co makes a crucial contribution to the high activity of the bimetal-based MOF catalyst. Additionally, this catalyst also displays outstanding long-term electrochemical durability for at least 80 h.

The photocatalytic activity of the composite g-C3N4/TiO2/Bi2O3 for degradation of dyes under sunlight and UV light irradiation was evaluated. It possessed the higher photocatalytic performance than that of pristine TiO2 or g-C3N4 under the same conditions. Under sunlight irradiation, the reaction rate constants of the g-C3N4/TiO2/Bi2O3 was about 4.2 times and 3.3 times higher than that of TiO2 and g-C3N4, respectively. The promising photocatalytic performance was attributed to the broader light absorption range and efficient separation of photoinduced carriers. Moreover, based on the TEM, XPS, XRD, UV-vis spectrum, radicals scavenging test and Mott-Schottky analysis systematic mechanism for photodegradation process was proposed. This work provides a promising strategy for the modification of TiO2-based semiconductors by incorporating different quantum dots and promoting the efficiency of the photocatalysts in practical application.

All these triphenylene-armed oligomers TrO[O(CH2)(n)OTP](3) (n = 6,8,10) exhibit liquid crystalline over broad mesophase ranges including room temperature. Oligomer TrO[O(CH2)(6)OTP](3) exhibit a rectangular columnar mesophase, while others with the linkage longer show a hexagonal columnar mesophase. This modulation of phase behaviours was demonstrated to be generated by steric perturbations introduced between the three decyloxy substituents in central truxenone core and the linkages with different lengths, which cause the disturbance of the intracolumnar structure and influence the degree of ordering in columnar phases. No new electronic absorption except for the usual bands of the individual truxenone or triphenylene part was observed in dichloromethane solution of TrO[O(CH2)(6)OTP](3). However, two new emission peaks emerged and the intensity and position of the emission peaks were found to exhibit pronounced changes upon concentration variation, which can be attributed to the formation of intermolecular excimers.

The future carbon balance study has become an important part of research on the impacts of climate change. The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a key area for studying climate change. Grassland, as a typical ecosystem of the QTP, embodies the sensitivity of the plateau to the climatic environment, so the carbon balance of grassland under future climate change conditions is important for studying global change. This paper reviewed the literature on carbon balance projection of grassland on the QTP under climate change. Two types of research methods were used to analyze and discuss the studies' results, including experimental scenario projection and model projection. The experiment projected that appropriate temperature and moisture could enhance the carbon sink capacity of a grassland ecosystem, where moisture played a leading role. The model projection results showed that the carbon balance under different spatial and temporal scales were different. Although both can project the carbon balance of the study area, there are still some uncertainties.

The q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy set (q-RIVOFS) is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy set (IFS) and Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) and has emerged to solve more complex and uncertain decision making problems which IFS and PFS cannot handle. In this manuscript, the key innovation is to combine the traditional VIKOR model with q-RIVOFS to develop the q-rung interval-valued orthopair fuzzy VIKOR model. In the new developed model, to express more information, the attribute's values in MAGDM problems are depicted by q-RIVOFNs. First of all, some basic theories and aggregation operators of q-RIVOFNs are simply introduced. Then we develop the origin VIKOR model to q-RIVOFS environment and briefly express the computing steps of this new established model. Thereafter, the effectiveness of the model is verified by an example of supplier selection of medical consumer products and through comparative analysis, the superiority of the new method is further illustrated.

J	Huang, P; Peng, L; Pan, HY				Huang, Pei; Peng, Li; Pan, Hongyi			Linking the Random Forests Model and GIS to Assess Geo-Hazards Risk: A Case Study in Shifang County, China	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Geo-hazards; random forests model; risk assessment; Shifang county; support vector machine model	LANDSLIDE HAZARD; GEOLOGICAL DISASTERS; CLASSIFICATION; PREDICTION; MANAGEMENT; REGION; TREE	This study proposes an objective and accurate geo-hazards risk assessment method to address the challenge of increasingly severe hazards around the world. Previous studies mostly began from the perspectives of hazard and vulnerability, ignoring the role of survey data at disaster sites during risk assessments. The random forests (RF) model was applied in this study. Combined with detailed data from hazard sites, a geo-hazards risk assessment model was constructed, with the two dimensions of disaster hazard and vulnerability, was constructed. We analyzed the spatial pattern characteristics and the internal patterns of disaster risk and discussed the risk controlling factors and their contributions. The results showed the following. (1) The RF model, when combined with hazard, vulnerability conditions, and detailed data from disaster sites, can be used to zone and verify regional geo-hazards risks, providing a method for point-to-surface disaster risk mapping. (2) The RF-based geo-hazards risk assessment results were relatively consistent with the evaluation results from the support vector machine (SVM) model, but the accuracy and stability of the RF model were higher. (3) This method can be used to avoid the subjectivity in determining the weights and threshold values for indexes and can calculate the contribution of each index to geo-hazards risks.

To achieve the message embedding in the encryption domain, we first present an image encryption algorithm satisfying additive homomorphism based on the stream cipher. Then, we offer a matrix embedding method using Golay code, which has good embedding efficiency. In the proposed scheme, we pre-code the least significant bit (LSB) vectors of the cover image into the codewords before image encryption, so that we can implement the matrix embedding in the encrypted image. The experimental results show that the proposed scheme has excellent security performance. We can get a high quality stego-image after the image decryption and recover the cover image into a fidelity image while providing considerable payload.

J	Liu, Y; Deng, W; Peng, L				Liu, Ying; Deng, Wei; Peng, Li			Building a Framework of Evaluating Human-Environment Relationships: Considering the Differences between Subjective Evaluations and Objective Assessments	SUSTAINABILITY			English	Article						human-environment relationship; indicator; environment-oriented approach; subject-oriented approach	QUALITY-OF-LIFE; SUSTAINABILITY	The human-environment relationship is bidirectional, meaning that human attitudes and behavior to nature are at the root of environmental change, while changes in the environment affect human attitudes and behavior. It is necessary to analyze the human-environment relationship from two aspects: (a) Whether there is a good objective basis for maintaining an environment, and (b) whether people report that they are satisfied with that environment. This study attempted to construct a framework to evaluate the human-environment relationship considering these two aspects. The framework consists of three parts: Traditional evaluation, indicator construction, and evaluation considering the relationship between subjective and objective assessment. Traditional evaluations consist of subjective evaluations and objective assessments. Indicator construction focuses on putting forward indicators that quantitively evaluate the human-environment relationship, considering the results of objective assessments and subjective evaluations. The indicators introduced in this study include MD (match degree) and OSC (objective assessment and subjective evaluation comparison) to explain the difference and the relationship between objective assessments and subjective evaluations of the environment. Then, based on the indicator value, a matrix containing four situations (Match-H, Match-L, H-L, and L-H) was constructed to explore why a human-environment relationship may not be harmonious. Since the upper Minjiang River basin is a typical area, because of its intensive human activity, as well as its fragile ecological environment, this study chose it as a case study and used it to verify the framework. Through the framework construction and application, this study found that: (1) The framework of this study provided a more comprehensive method to evaluate the human-environment relationship; (2) as the subjective evaluation was based on individual comprehensive tradeoffs, the evaluation combining the subjective and objective assessment was more accurate; (3) environmental conditions were the basis, and human activities were the key factors, for the coordination of human-environment relationships; so the matrix put forward in this study was necessary for finding the cause of human-environment incongruity.

The authors of this paper investigated teacher factors behind the successful implementation of a reformed instructional model, the Dao Jiang Ping (DJP) model, in China. This study is part of a longitudinal project (2012-2017) that reported the level of DJP implementation and explored factors that influence teachers' implementation. This paper mainly focuses on the latter. Six teachers were examined to look for reasons behind their different levels of DJP implementation. The theory of planned behavior (TPB), which has been widely used to explain and predict people's behavior or intention to perform a behavior, is used as the theoretical framework for the study. Referring to the TPB framework, this study summarized factors into individual factors, perceived social factors and perceived contextual factors. Furthermore, the authors suggest extending the TPB framework by including teachers' understanding of the reform ideas to facilitate its application in order to explore factors in reform contexts. Lastly, this study discusses several important factors that help teachers to implement new teaching methodologies continually, thus promoting the sustainable implementation of reforms.

Based on the two models, hysteresis loops, nucleation fields and coercivity are obtained by one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) micromagnetic methods. In particular, the calculated nucleation fields (H-N) and coercivity (H-C) match very well with the experimental data. It is found that the increase in the soft phase thickness (L-s) leads to a transition of the coercivity mechanism from nucleation to pinning. Such a pinning is inherently related to nucleation and has both attributes of traditional nucleation and pinning, called as a hybrid coercivity mechanism here. It is general for all hard/soft composites and can be extended to single-phased permanent magnets where defects are inevitable.

Breast cancer can occur in both men and women, but it is far more common in women. Real-time monitoring of breast cancer indicators is becoming increasingly important. It can help create advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer. In this paper, we provide a nonparametric statistical method to predict and detect breast cancer occur. The exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control scheme is based on rank methods so that it is completely nonparametric. It is efficient in detecting the shifts for multivariate processes. A real example data from the University Hospital Centre of Coimbra is given to illustrate this method.

As the initiatory task of EV charging station (EVCS) construction, site selection play an important part throughout the whole life cycle, which is deemed to be multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problem involving many experts and many conflicting attributes. In this paper, a grey relational analysis (GRA) method is investigated to tackle the probabilistic uncertain linguistic MAGDM in which the attribute weights are completely unknown information. Firstly, the definition of the expected value is then employed to objectively derive the attribute weights based on the CRiteria Importance Through Intercriteria Correlation (CRITIC) method. Then, the optimal alternative is chosen by calculating largest relative relational degree from the probabilistic uncertain linguistic positive ideal solution (PULPIS) which considers both the largest grey relational coefficient from the PULPIS and the smallest grey relational coefficient from the probabilistic uncertain linguistic negative ideal solution (PULNIS). Finally, a numerical case for site selection of electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) is designed to illustrate the proposed method. The result shows the approach is simple, effective and easy to calculate.

Despite the advances in electrocatalysts, how to combine active sites to synergistically promote both steps and understand the underlying mechanism remain largely unexplored. Here, Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations predict that NiO accelerates the Volmer step while metallic Ni facilitates the Heyrovsky/Tafel step. A facile strategy is thus developed to control Ni/NiO heterosurfaces in uniform and well-dispersed Ni-based nanocrystals, targeting both reaction steps synergistically. By systematically modulating the surface composition, we find that steering the elementary steps through tuning the Ni/NiO ratio can significantly enhance alkaline HER activity, and Ni/NiO nanocrystals with a Ni/NiO ratio of 23.7% deliver the best activity, outperforming other state-of-the-art analogues. The results suggest that integrating bicomponent active sites for elementary steps is effective for promoting alkaline HER, but they have to be balanced.

In order to efficiently solve the generated linear large-scale system, the generalized minimal residual (GMRES) algorithm is applied. For accelerating the convergence rate of the iterative, the Strang-type, Chan-type and P-type preconditioners are introduced. The suggested method can reach higher order accuracy both in space and in time than the existing methods. When the used boundary value method is A(k1,k2) -stable, it is proven that Strang-type preconditioner is invertible and the spectra of preconditioned matrix is clustered around 1. It implies that the iterative solution is convergent rapidly. Numerical experiments with the absorbing boundary condition and the generalized Dirichlet type further verify the efficiency.

The as-synthesized KCNN had a very efficient ability of photocatalytic degradation of RhB by visible light, and its catalytic rate constant was 8.3 times higher than that of pure g-C3N4. This excellent photocatalytic performance came from the bridging doping of K atom and the morphology of the KCNN nanosheets. The KCNN nanosheets not only had the advantage of the large specific surface area, but also enhanced the electron-hole separation by shortened charge-to-surface migration length. In addition, the bridging doping of K atom increased the absorption of visible light, and promoted the separation of electron-hole due to electrostatic and bridging effects. Our work not only provided a promising material for effective removal of dye contaminants from wastewater but also opened a new window for the mechanism of electron and hole (e(-) and h(+)) separation in doped modified and dimensionality tuning materials.

The results showed that the allelochemicals decreased leaf area, seedling height, main root length, biomass and increased stomatal density, among which, volatile oil caused the greatest changes. Variable accumulation of metabolites, in response to treatment with the volatile oil and the two monomers, were identified by GC-MS analysis. Volatile oil significantly decreased the polyols and sugars (myo-Inositol and maltose) and significantly increased the TCA cycle metabolites such as succinic acid, as well as amino acids (glutamic acid, asparagine, beta-alanine and 3-cyano-L-alanine). The two monomers (a-terpinene and rho-cymene), significantly increased the amino acids (glutamine and 3-cyano-L-alanine and rho-cymene) but decreased the sugar gentibiose. Due to the antagonistic effects among the components, they interfere with photosynthesis, amino acid metabolism and TCA cycle of receptor plants. The 3-cyano-L-alanine, the only differential accumulating metabolite was increased in all three treatments, suggesting that allelochemical stress induced the accumulation of cyanide and other toxic substances in receptor plants, thus inhibiting its growth.

The TODIM (an acronym in Portuguese of interactive and multi-criteria decision making) approach, which can describe the psychological behaviors of decision maker, has been proved to be effective to solve multi-attribute decision making (MADM) problems. The definitions of dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy set (DHPFS) and the processes of traditional TODIM approach are firstly introduced in this paper. Then, the TODIM approach is extended to solve the MADM problems with a dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy number (DHPFN). Finally, a case study evaluating the personal default risk in P2P online lending is conducted to demonstrate that the proposed approach is applicable to solve MADM problems. In addition, some comparative analyses are performed to compare the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy TODIM method with the other two integrated operators of DHPFS. Through the comparisons, we conclude that the advantage of the proposed method over other methods is that it reduces uncertainty while taking into account the psychological characteristics of lenders to avoid risk. Today's credit environment is fraught with risks, and the psychological behaviors of decision makers are important factors that cannot be ignored. For these reasons, the dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy TODIM method is applicable for evaluating personal default risk.

J	Hu, Y; Jia, GZ				Hu, Ying; Jia, Guozhu			Molecular dynamics simulation investigation of the microwave heating supercritical water	JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR LIQUIDS			English	Article						Molecular dynamics; Microwave heating; Supercritical water; Energy distribution; Molecular structure	STRUCTURAL ORDER; FORCE-FIELD; LIQUID; DIFFUSION	Nonequilibrium NVE molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the heating process of supercritical water (SCW) by the microwaves (the field intensities are from 3 x 10(5)V/m to 3 x 10(9)V/m with the frequencies of 915 MHz and 2.45 GHz, respectively). The energy distribution, microscopic molecular structure, diffusivity and hydrogen bond dynamics were analyzed. Microwaves field dependence on the rotational and translational coupling mechanisms of water molecules have been detected. The microwave energy has been converted to the kinetic and intermolecular energies of water. There are about 40% absorbed microwave energy is stored as the intermolecular energy, and the proportion decline at higher field intensity. The diffusion of super-critical water is non-linearly fluctuation due to the coupling of rotation and translation motions. And this work may provide a theoretical basis to improve the efficiency of industrial application with microwave and SCW. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The EDAS method is very effective especially when the conflicting attributes exist in the MAGDM issues in which the optimal alternative should have the biggest value of PDAS and the smallest value of NDAS. In this paper, we put forward the EDAS method for MAGDM issues under q-ROFSs, which makes use of average solution (AS) for assessing the chosen alternatives. The positive distance from AS (PDAS) and negative distance from AS (NDAS) is derived through the score of q-ROFSs. Then, the sorting order or the optimal alternative can be acquired by computing integrative appraisal score. Finally, a numerical example for buying a refrigerator is given to testify our developed EDAS method and some comparative analysis are also raised to further show the precious merits of this method.

In this study, the conventional Fenton method was used in the advanced treatment of SAARB leachate. Fluorescent components in SAARB leachate were identified and tracked with parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, and the influencing factors, i.e., Fe2+ dosage, n(H2O2/FeSO4) ratio, initial pH, and reaction time, on the removal of fluorescent components were systematically investigated. UV-Vis spectra show the structural transformation of dissolved organic matter (DOM) in SAARB leachate. Results show that SAARB leachate mainly contains two fluorescent components: fulvic-like substances [C1; excitation (Ex)/emission (Em) (nm), (245)280/405] and humic-like substances [C2; Ex/Em (nm), (260)360/435]. A higher Fe2+ dosage, longer reaction time, and acidic conditions increased the degradation efficiency of organics, but excess H2O2 inhibited the treatment process. Under optimum Fenton parameters (Fe2+ dosage of 5 mmol/L, n(H2O2/FeSO4) ratio of 8, initial pH of 4, and reaction time of 60 min), removal rates of C1 and C2 were 52.97% and 77.81%, respectively. UV-Vis spectra indicate that the Fenton reaction can destroy unsaturated conjugated bonds, decreasing the humification degree, hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and condensation degree. Finally, the biodegradability (represented by BOD5 (biochemical oxygen demand for 5-days)/COD) greatly increased (from 0.05 to 0.36), thus benefiting further biological treatment. The results provide suggestions and guidance for practical applications in landfill leachate treatment. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Therefore, the determination of arsenic and analysis of arsenic species have always received great attention. Atomic spectrometry is a preferred method for arsenic analysis mainly owning to its high selectivity and sensitivity. In recent years, a great deal of research has involved the determination and speciation of arsenic in various environmental and biological samples by atomic spectrometry. This review covers the sample preparation and arsenic separation/pre-concentration process in arsenic determination and speciation analysis by atomic spectrometry, and emphasizes on their development and prospects.

The COD removal percentage of the effluent from the MBR treatment process was investigated by gamma irradiation combined with coagulation process. The experimental results showed that the removal percentage of COD could achieve 45.3% by gamma irradiation alone at the dose of 4 kGy. The COD removal percentage could be improved by the combination of coagulation with gamma irradiation. Particularly, the removal percentage of COD could increase to 55.2% at the dose of 1 kGy, when iron salt was used for the coagulation process. More researches are required in future study for further increasing the removal percentage of COD of leachate, for example, integrating radiation process into biological treatment process to enhance the COD removal.

Yet, the underlying cognitive neural mechanism of it remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate the underlying cognitive neural mechanisms of response inhibition to angry expressions in individuals with high trait aggression and whether there was emotion-specificity of response inhibition in individuals with high trait aggression. 58 individuals (29 participants with high trait aggression) completed an emotional Go/NoGo task, during which participants' EEG were recorded. Results indicated that individuals with high trait aggression showed smaller NoGo P3 effect than individuals with low trait aggression, in particular facing angry or fearful expressions. These results suggest that individuals with high trait aggression show deficits in response inhibition, in particular facing angry expressions, and these deficits exist in the later stage of response inhibition, which is closely related to the actual inhibition of the motor system; there is no emotion-specificity of response inhibition in individuals with high trait aggression.

Regarding the decision table with granular structures, the traditional classification-based attribute reducts at the macro-top already have the algebra and information interpretations, while the new class-specific attribute reducts at the meso-middle currently have only the algebra explanation. Aiming at the class-specific reducts, this paper establishes three-way types from the information viewpoint, and it further compares the information and algebra types. At first, the three-way information class-specific reducts (including the likelihood, prior, and posterior types) are systematically proposed by using the three-way weighted entropies with uncertainty measurement. Then, optimization preservation conditions of the positive region and weighted entropy are deeply mined to describe reduction targets of the algebra and information types, and relevant conditions related to knowledge coarsening are effectively represented by the granular merging and three-way regions. Furthermore, all four types of class-specific reducts gain their relationships, including the strong-weak relationship based on optimization preservation conditions, the degeneration relationship based on consistency and inconsistency, and the information relationship based on systematic equalities. Finally, algebra and information class-specific reducts and their relationships are verified by a consistency example and an inconsistency example. As a conclusion, the four types of class-specific reducts adopt distinctive algebra or information perspectives to present the difference and emphasis, especially in the inconsistency case, and they have in-depth mutual relationships. This study provides novel insight into attribute reduction based on granular computing, mainly via the information theory and three-way decisions. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Due to the fact that people always use hands to complete a variety of human-computer interaction, the finger-based interactive projection technology is worth being researched. In this paper, an ordinary monocular camera is used to acquire video frame on projection screen, and the touch signal of finger in frame is used as the input of interactive projection system. Because the differences between spatial frequency of common digital camera and the projection screen is small, the frame obtained from camera will contain moire fringe, which needs to be filtered in image frequency domain. Then the difference between current frame edge and previous frame edge is calculated to obtain moving object edge clues. According to these clues, the most possible contour curve is searched in current frame edge, and the curve is fitted by polynomial approximation method. Its curvature integration is used to match with the curvature integration of finger template curve. After that the fingers in the curve are recognized. Because color information is not needed, this method can be used to recognize gloved fingers. Finally, finger shadow is used to judge whether the finger touches projection screen to complete interactive process. The experiments of writing and collaboratively rotating picture on projector screen show that this method can effectively complete interactive operation with the projection screen and can realize the multi-user operation.

In this work, lead-free relaxor ferroelectric ceramics of (1 - x)[(Bi0.55Na0.45)(0.94)Ba-0.06](0.98)La0.02TiO3-xAgNbO(3) were synthesized by a conventional sintering method. All ceramics are situated at the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases, suggesting that a small amount of AgNbO3 (abbreviated as AN) doping does not affect this phase-coexistence structure. The added AN not only improves the dielectric breakdown strength (DBS) from 84.11 kV cm(-1) (x = 0) to 137.89 kV cm(-1) (x = 0.01), but also broadens the phase transition peak and enhances the relaxation behavior of ceramics. Moreover, when x = 0.01, the ceramic demonstrates a high saturation polarization (P-s) of 25.54 mu C cm(-2) and a low remanent polarization (P-r) of 0.65 mu C cm(-2) at an electric field of 130 kV cm(-1). More importantly, an optimal energy storage density (W-s) of 1.697 J cm(-3) and energy efficiency (eta) of 82.3% are simultaneously achieved in the BNBLT-0.01AN ceramic with excellent thermal stability (similar to 25-175 degrees C) and frequency stability (similar to 10-80 Hz).

In this Letter, we propose a new structure of ultra-broadband absorber, which is composed of a periodic array of single-sized titanium (Ti) patches and a sandwich (Ti/SiO2/Ti) plane. In the infrared transparency window of the atmosphere, the structure proposed can achieve nearly perfect absorption with the maximal absorptivity up to 99% for the wavelength range from 9.77 to 10.69 mu m, and a high average absorptivity of 96.7% from 8 to 13 mu m. The strongly localized electric field, at the interface of the top thin Ti film and the dielectric spacer of sandwich plane, leads to the ultra-broadband high absorption. In addition, this structure demonstrates the insensitivity of polarization and oblique angle. This metamaterial absorber with high performances in both bandwidth and absorptivity shows a promising prospect in applications such as thermal emitters, thermal coolers, and infrared sensors.

These discotic mesogens self-assemble into supramolecular columnar hexagonal mesophases with high clearing transition temperatures, demonstrating a strong tendency for pi-stacking aggregation in the LC state owing to their good planar molecular structures. Four triphenylene-fused mesogens exhibit strong absorption bands in the range of 262 nm to 450 nm and corresponding emission bands between 468 nm and 615 nm, respectively. Both the experimental results and computational calculations show that the mesomorphic and electronic properties of four mesogens are strongly affected by the expansion of triphenylene core and the electronic nature of the nitrogenated benzimidazole or perimidine ring. Besides, these mesogens also possess higher HOMO energies and narrower HOMO-LUMO gaps than parent anhydride. Furthermore, the solution of TDPI or TDP in THF at a concentration as low as 0.45 wt % exhibited organogel phases due to strong intermolecular pi-pi interactions between the large aromatic cores. All these properties qualify this new type of discotic liquid crystals as potential applications as organic semiconductor materials and sensors.

We grew un-fragmented (connected) and fragmented (disconnected) ramet pairs of the floating, clonal plant Salvinia natans in cylindrical containers with different diameters and heights (volumes) filled with solutions of two nutrient levels (high vs. low). To simulate competition environments that are commonly confronted by S. natans, we also added two ramets of another floating plants Spirodela polyrrhiza in each container. Biomass (total biomass, floating biomass and submerged biomass) and number of ramets of S. salvinia were higher in the containers with a larger diameter. Compared to the low nutrient level, the high nutrient level increased number of ramets, and altered submerged to floating mass ratio of S. salvinia. The impacts of physical space on floating mass and number of ramets were stronger under the high than under the low nutrient level. Clonal fragmentation positively affected biomass in the containers with a smaller volume (a smaller height and diameter), but had little impact in the containers with a larger volume (a larger height or diameter). Our results suggest that physical space can interact with nutrients and clonal fragmentation to affect the performance of S. salvinia under competition.

The new species had been confused with Zhangixalus smaragdinus (Blyth, 1852) in the past. Zhangixalus pachvproctus sp. nov. can be distinguished from Z. smaragdinus morphologically by the protruding vent in adult males, large thick grey reticular mottles below the white stripe on flank, more oblique snout in profile and wider head, longer snout, greater internarial distance, larger tympanum and longer hindlimb. The new species can be distinguished from other species of Zhangixalus with green dorsum by the following combination of characters: body size larger (SVL of adult males: 74.2-83.3 mm; SVL of adult female: 102.4 mm); dorsum smooth; narrow white stripes along edge of the lower jaw, body sides, outer side of limbs and above the vent; absence of brown bands on canthus rostralis, upper eyelid and supratympanic fold; webbing between fingers and toes complete except between the first two fingers; and internal single subgular vocal sac. Phylogeny based on comparison of 16S rRNA sequences suggests that the new species is the sister taxon to Z. smaragdinus and the two species differ by 7.63% in the uncorrected pairwise distance of 16S sequences.

However, the 1T' phase is metastable compared to the 2H phase for most of 2D TMDCs, among which the 1T' phase is least favored in monolayer MoS2. Here we report a clean and controllable technique to locally induce nanometer-sized 1T' phase in monolayer 2H-MoS2 via a weak Argon-plasma treatment, resulting in topological phase boundaries of high density. We found that the stabilization of 1T' phase arises from the concerted effects of S vacancies and the tensile strain. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) clearly reveals a spin-orbit band gap (similar to 60 meV) and topologically protected in-gap states residing at the 1T'-2H phase boundary, which are corroborated by density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. The strategy developed in this work can be generalized to a large variety of TMDCs materials, with potentials to realize scalable electronics and spintronics with low dissipation.

J	Qian, Q; Yang, Y; Gu, J; Feng, HR				Qian, Qian; Yang, Yang; Gu, Jing; Feng, Hairong			Information authenticity, spreading willingness and credit risk contagion - A dual-layer network perspective	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Credit risk contagion; Information authenticity; Spreading willingness; Dual-layer network; Epidemic model	SOCIAL CONTAGIONS; SMALL-WORLD; MODEL	The spreading of information related to enterprise credit risk among entrepreneurs will affect the credit risk contagion among enterprises. As far as the subjectivity and objectivity are concerned, entrepreneurs' spreading willingness and the authenticity of information will affect information spreading, and then affect the credit risk contagion. Firstly, this paper analyzes the information spreading path among entrepreneurs and the influence path to credit risk contagion theoretically. Secondly, from the perspective of complex network, a dual-layer network of entrepreneur social relationship-enterprise association is constructed, and an SIR-SIR model is built to reveal interactive between the information spreading and credit risk contagion. Finally, the sensitivity of some parameters is analyzed. The results show that: (1) the contagion threshold of credit risk is related to the authenticity of information and the spreading willingness of entrepreneurs (2) the social rate of entrepreneurs (the probability of social relationship between entrepreneurs) and the similarity of dual-layer network (the proportion of relationships exists between enterprises and entrepreneurs at same time) will affect credit risk contagion. Based on the research results, we propose effective strategies to restrain credit risk contagion: (1) we can suppress the credit risk contagion by improving the authenticity of risk information; (2) when the authenticity of risk information is high, increasing the spreading willingness of entrepreneurs and the similarity rate of dual-layer network can also control the credit risk contagion.

Our empirical results show that VIX has larger in-sample impacts on US stock market volatility than EMV trackers. However, the out-of-sample volatility predictive performances of EMV trackers are generally superior to VIX across different US stock indices and prediction time horizons. In addition, policy-related EMV tracker acts better than VIX and other EMV trackers in predicting volatilities of US stock markets. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Mu, Y; Cheng, C; Hu, CE; Zhou, XL				Mu, Yi; Cheng, Cai; Hu, Cui-E; Zhou, Xiao-Lin			Structural and electronic transport properties of a SiC chain encapsulated inside a SiC nanotube: first-principles study	PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							SILICON-CARBIDE NANOTUBES; LINEAR CARBON CHAINS; NANOWIRES; MOLECULE; SCALE	Silicon carbide (SiC) chains and silicon carbide nanotubes (SiCNTs), as promising one-dimensional nanostructures, have potential applications in more controllable nanoelectronic devices. In this paper, we design a completely new hybrid structure with encapsulation of a linear SiC chain inside a SiCNT, using first-principles calculation and the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism to systematically investigate the structural stability and electronic properties, particularly the quantum transport properties. It is found that, due to the nanotube-chain interaction, the stability of this structure is mainly provided by the charge transfer from the hosting tube to the guest chain. Furthermore, the transport properties of the hybrid structure confirm that encapsulation of a SiC chain within a SiCNT can significantly enhance the electronic transport of the component system in a wide range of high voltage. The distance and the unique coupling configuration between the encapsulated system and the electrodes are demonstrated to be other important factors that affect the transport behaviours. We hope that our study of encapsulation may offer a significant starting point for the design of new materials related to low-dimensional SiC nanostructures and possibly open a novel path towards stability and conductivity enhancement.

Electrochemical N-2 reduction is a promising and environmentally friendly route for artificial N-2-to-NH3 fixation under milder conditions. Herein, we report that dendritic Cu acts as a highly active electrocatalyst to catalyze N-2 to NH3 fixation under ambient conditions. When tested in 0.1 M HCl, such an electrocatalyst achieves a high faradaic efficiency of 15.12% and a large NH3 yield rate of 25.63 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.40 V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, this catalyst shows high electrochemical stability and excellent selectivity toward NH3 synthesis.

In this work, vanadium (V)-doped nickel phosphide (Ni2P) nanosheets self-assembled microspheres supported on nickel foam (Ni1V1P NSs/NF) were synthesized as a novel OER catalyst by combined processes of hydrothermal method and low-temperature phosphorization. The synthesized Ni1V1P NSs/NF material shows excellent catalytic activity due to its interconnected three-dimensional (3D) structure and synergistic effect between nickel and vanadium. When used as a catalyst electrode for OER, the synthesized Ni1V1P NSs/NF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic activity, reaching a current density of 50 mA cm(-2) at the low overpotential of 250 mV in 1.0 M KOH. This material also shows superior electrochemical stability with negligible decay of the activity after continual measurement for 15 h at 50 and 100 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, respectively. This work provides a valuable method to synthesize efficient OER catalysts by doping valence-variable metal ions and designing distinctive 3D structure.

Here, we analytically and numerically study the dynamics of the AFM skyrmion and skyrmionium induced by spin currents. Our calculations demonstrate that the current-induced spin-transfer torques can drive AFM skyrmion and skyrmionium with the same speed, while their steady motion speeds induced by spin-orbit torques are different. Furthermore, it is found that due to the existence of the effective AFM texture mass, the AFM skyrmion and skyrmionium obey the momentum theorem, and the time evolution of the position induced by alternating currents presents a phase. Besides, a spin torque nano-oscillator based on the AFM skyrmionium can produce high frequencies, similar to that based on the AFM skyrmion. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with the analytical solutions. Our results demonstrate the inertial dynamics of the AFM skyrmion and skyrmionium and may provide guidelines for building skyrmion-based spintronic devices.

J	Tian, L; Long, Y; Song, SY; Wang, C				Tian Long; Long Yan; Song Shuyan; Wang Cheng			Synthesis of Flower-like Structured Mn/CuO-CeO2 and the Catalytic Performance for CO Oxide Reaction	CHEMICAL JOURNAL OF CHINESE UNIVERSITIES-CHINESE			Chinese	Article						CeO2; CuO; Composite nanomaterial; Oxidation of CO; Synergy	SOOT OXIDATION ACTIVITY; CUO-CEO2 CATALYSTS; CEO2; COMBUSTION; NANOPARTICLES; CERIA	The unique properties make CeO2 play important roles in many catalytic reactions. However, CeO2 alone as a catalyst is fairly unfavorable due to its low catalytic activity and poor stability for high. temperature reactions. Therefore, in this work, we constructed the composite of CeO2 and transition metal oxides for the purpose of increasing the stability and improving the catalytic performance of CeO2. We synthesized the Mn/CuO-CeO2 composite nanomaterials with different components and three-dimensional flower-like structures via solvent thermal method. The XRD patterns confirmed that the synthesis formed solid solutions affording the single phase of fluorite-type CeO2. And the SEM images showed the composites have flower. like structures which were assembled by numerous nanocrystals and the structural unit of each nanocrystal was nanoparticles with a size of about 10 nm. The catalytic activity of the catalyst increases successively in the order of CeO2 <CuO-CeO2 <xMn/CuO-CeO2 mainly associated with the strong interaction between constituents owing to the highly dispersed copper and manganese species. And with the increase of Mn doping, the catalytic activity of the composite increases first and then decreases. When n(Ce) : n(Cu) : n(Mn) = 25 : 5 : 2, the catalyst exhibited the best catalytic performance: the complete transformation of CO can be achieved at 173 degrees C in CO oxidation test, and it showed good stability.

To that end, we study the effect of organic molecule rotations on the properties of such hybrid semiconductors using the swarm intelligence-based structure prediction method combined with ab initio density functional calculations. Adopting the cubic phases of APbI(3) [A = CH3NH3(MA), CHNH2NH2(FA) and CH3CH2NH3(EA)], we determine the energetically stable/metastable configurations of organic molecules inside the quasicubic perovskite cages. Different cation orientations result in up to similar to 250 meV/formula changes in the material free energy, reflecting the complex energy landscape of these hybrid materials containing dynamically rotating organic components. Notably, the [012] orientation of MA is found to give the most stable structure of MAPbI(3), while the conventional [001], [011], or [111] directions remain slightly higher in energy. Molecular orientations clearly influence the fundamental electronic bandgap and also modify the magnitude of Rashba-type energy band splitting resulting in indirect gap behavior. However, the dielectric screening remains large for all orientations thus creating weakly bound excitons. Based on the analysis of many organic molecule configurations obtained through the structure search technique, our results provide insightful understanding on the effects of organic molecule rotation on optoelectronic properties and carrier dynamics of hybrid halide perovskites.

The snowfall concentration was analyzed by means of three indices: the snowfall concentration index (CI), snowfall concentration degree (SCD), and snowfall concentration period (SCP). The results demonstrated that the snowfall and temperature increased by 5.69 mm and 0.35 degrees C per decade, respectively, in northern Xinjiang during the time period from 1961 to 2017. Maximum snowfall occurred at a critical temperature ranging from - 2 to 1 degrees C. The increased snowfall mainly took place in northern Xinjiang during winter. The distribution of the high snowfall CI value indicated that the daily snowfall showed a high irregularity in the northern slope of the Tianshan Mountains and the northern Altay Mountains, in which more than 77% snowfall was contributed by the 25% snowfall days in a year. The results of SCP revealed that the snowfall concentrated in northern Xinjiang during December, with an earlier arrival in the north and east of northern Xinjiang than in the western part. The SCD results proved that the monthly snowfall was more concentrated in the northern Altay Mountains, Ili Valley, and Boertala Valley than over the eastern part of northern Xinjiang during a year. The snowfall in almost all stations increased in concentration throughout the year. The obtained study results could provide scientific reference for future water resource management and snow disaster prevention under a warming climate.

Additionally, so as to indicate the applicability of the devised method, this model is confirmed by a numerical case for the supplier selection of medical consumption products. Some comparative studies are made with some existing methods. The proposed method can also successfully select suitable alternatives in other selection problems.

However, if it is in dioxygen, argon, or carbon monoxide, [Zn-2(tmpe)(DMF)]center dot 2DMF center dot 8H(2)O (2) is the product. Both compounds are chemically stable coordination polymers. 1 contains zinc carboxylate paddlewheels as nodes linearly bridged by CO2 into two interpenetrating lattices, and 2 has an infinite single framework formed by a tetranuclear node. 1 is the second example containing the linear CO2-bridged paddlewheel node. Interestingly, CO2 fixation in a mu(2)-eta(2)(O,O) bridging mode is observed in 1, which is rarely characterized structurally and has been confirmed using IR and gas chromatography analysis. The stability of 1 is further verified by density functional theory calculations, which found an energy minimum with a Zn-O=C angle of 180 degrees. Both compounds display strong emission around 490 nm and excited-state lifetimes around 2.4 ns.

In most of the existing crowd escape simulation systems, human behaviors are often limited to taking flight or running away. However, due to the personality and the current emotion of each individual, they may behave in various ways, such as Samaritan or giving up on life et al. In order to simulate such like diversity crowd behavior, this paper presents an emotion-based diversity behavior model, by adopting the OCEAN personality model and the OCC emotion model, while being enriched with the incorporation of CA-SIRS emotion contagion model. We also consider the effects of Yerkes-Dodson Law on individuals' behaviors, which allows individuals to make authentic behaviors under stressful circumstances. The proposed model can provide more diverse individual behaviors compared to the existing emotion-based escape simulation models. The psychology-based individual modeling enables our model to be applied in various scenarios with slightly parameter adjustments.

Currently, several efficient piggybacking designs have been proposed. In this paper, we propose a more efficient "one-to-one" piggybacking design (OOP) to further reduce the repair bandwidth. Different from the existing piggybacking designs, OOP adopts a simple encoding principle that one parity node only piggybacks symbols from one substripe. Particularly, OOP takes into account the efficient repair of systematic nodes and parity nodes simultaneously. It is shown that for OOP design, the optimal number of substripes is (root r - 1 + r - 1), the average repair bandwidth ratio of systematic nodes can be as low as 2 root r-1+1/2 root r-1+r, and the average repair bandwidth ratio of parity nodes reaches (root r-1+1/r + (r-1)(2)-root(r-1)(3)/rk). In contrast to the existing piggybacking designs, OOP can further reduce the repair bandwidth of both system nodes and parity nodes.

The Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic sets (P2TLSs) can reflect uncertain or fuzzy information well and solve the supplier selection in medical instrument industries, and the original Taxonomy is very appropriate for comparing different alternatives with respect to their advantages from studied attributes. In this study, we present an algorithm that combines Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic numbers (P2TLNs) with the Taxonomy method, where P2TLNs are applied to express the evaluation of decision makers on alternatives. Relying on the Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted average (P2TLWA) operator or Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic weighted geometric (P2TLWG) operator to fuse P2TLNs, the new general framework is established for Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) under the classical Taxonomy method. Ultimately, an application case for supplier selection in medical instrument industries is designed to test the novel method's applicability and practicality and a comparative analysis with three other methods is used to elaborate further.

For the national economy, the engineering construction is not only a carrier for specific economic tasks, but also a driving force for rapid and sustained economic development. With the continuous expansion of the scale of construction projects, safety management problems of construction projects are constantly exposed. How to effectively avoid accidents has become an important issue to be solved urgently in the construction industry. This paper mainly evaluates human factors in the process of construction project management, such as workers' proficiency, workers' safety awareness, technical workers' quality, and workers' emergency capacity, with the purpose of helping China's construction projects proceed smoothly. In this research, we provide a multiple attribute group decision-making (MAGDM) technique based on Pythagorean 2-tuple linguistic numbers (P2TLNs) and the VIseKriterijumska Optimizacija I KOmpromisno Resenje (VIKOR) method for evaluating the human factors of construction projects. P2TLNs are used to represent the performance assessments of decision makers. Relying on a P2TLWA operator, P2TLWG operator, and the essential VIKOR method, a general framework is established. An application is presented to test the validity of the new method, and a comparative analysis with two algorithms and the P2TL-TODIM method is illustrated with detail.

The key intermediates, epsilon-hydroxyl-beta,gamma-unsaturated ketones, are readily available by Ni-catalyzed three-component coupling of 1,3-dienes, aldehydes, and acylzirconocene reagents. These polyfunctionalized ketones can undergo a V-catalyzed cascade of epoxidation and ring rearrangement to provide access to 6-hydroxyl-2,8-DOBCOs. Mechanistic studies indicate that the V(V) species, generated under epoxidation conditions, promotes the ring rearrangement in a stereospecific manner. Meanwhile, the epsilon-hydroxyl-beta-gamma-unsaturated ketones are transformed into 6-amino-2,8-DOBCOs by a Cu-catalyzed cascade of aziridination and ring rearrangement. In the end, the one-pot approach toward 6-hydroxyl- or 6-amino-2,8-DOBCOs from 1,3-diene, aldehydes, and acylzirconocene reagents is more favorable.

Here, we investigated whether visuospatial attention was involved in maintaining object representations in visual WM. To this end, the alpha lateralization and contralateral delay activity (CDA) were analyzed as neural markers for visuospatial attention and visual WM storage, respectively. In the single-task condition, participants performed a grating change-detection task. To probe the role of visuospatial attention in maintaining WM contents, two color squares were presented above and below the fixation point during the retention interval, which remained visible until the detection display was present. In the dual-task condition, participants were required to maintain lateralized gratings while staring at the center-presented color squares, to detect possible subsequent color change. With this task, sustained visuospatial attention that guided to individual memory representations was disrupted. The behavioral data showed that, the insertion of secondary task significantly deteriorated WM performance. For electrophysiological data, we divided the retention interval into two stages, the early stage and late stage, bounded by the onset of the secondary task. We found that CDA amplitude was lower under the dual-task condition than the single-task condition during the late stage, but not the early stage, and the extent to which CDA reduced tracked the impaired memory performance at the individual level. Also, alpha lateralization only could be observed in the single-task condition of the late stage, and completely disappeared in the dual-task condition, indicating the disruption of visuospatial attention directed to memory representations. Individuals who experienced greater visuospatial attention disruption, as indicated by the alpha lateralization, had lower maintenance-associated neural activity (CDA), and suffered greater impairment of memory performance. These findings confirm that sustained visuospatial attention continues improving visual WM processing after the initial encoding phase, and most likely participates in this process by supporting the maintenance of representations in an active state.

In the infra-slow frequency range (<0.1 Hz), inter-regional phase lag is of importance for brain function (e.g., anti-phase between the default mode network and task positive network). However, the role of phase lag in cognitive processing remains unclear. Based on the frequency tagging experimental paradigm and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique, we investigated inter-regional phase lag and phase coherence using a face recognition task (n = 30, 15 males/15 females). Phase coherence within the face processing system was significantly increased during task state, highlighting the importance of regular inter-regional phase relationship for face recognition. Moreover, results showed decreased phase lag within the core and extended face areas (face processing system) and increased phase lag between the face processing system and frontoparietal network, indicating a reorganization of inter-regional relationships of the two systems. Inter-regional phase lag was modulated by the task at ascending and descending phases of the fMRI signal, suggesting a phase-dependent inter-regional relationship. Furthermore, phase lags between visual cortex and amygdala and between visual cortex and motor area were positively related to reaction time, indicating better task performance depends on both rapid emotional detection pathway and visual-motor pathway. Overall, inter-regional phase synchronization in the infra-slow frequency range is of important for effective information communication and cognitive performance. (C) 2019 IBRO.

This discussion results in the introduction of a new definition of the degree of cross-polarization (DCP) which depends on two locations and can reduce to the classical degree of polarization as its two locations coinciding.

The frequency-, temperature- and fatigue-dependent energy storage properties of the materials were investigated. After the dopings of La3+ and Zr4+, the crystal structure of the ceramics remains unchanged; and tetragonal and rhombohedral phases coexist in all ceramics which exhibit a relaxor phase transition. The co-substitution of La3+ and Zr4+ leads to the high dielectric breakdown strength (DBS), large spontaneous polarization (P-s) and small remnant polarization (P-r) of the materials. The optimum energy storage properties are achieved at x/y = 0.02/0.04, giving high recoverable energy storage density of W-rec similar to 1.55 J/cm(3), excellent energy storage efficiency of eta similar to 72.6% and large dielectric breakdown strength of DBS similar to 136 kV/cm. Furthermore, the ceramic with x/y = 0.02/0.04 possesses superior durability of frequency (similar to 2-60 Hz), fatigue (similar to 10(3)) and temperature (similar to 25-245 degrees C).

However, the skyrmion may be destroyed at the nanodisk edge when the driving current density is larger than a threshold, which leads to a maximum oscillation frequency that may not be enough for ultrahigh frequency applications based on skyrmions. In this work, a modified nanodisk structure, in which a skyrmion can be driven by a large current density, is proposed. Numerical simulations demonstrate that when the edge of a ferromagnetic nanodisk has enhanced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the upper threshold of the skyrmion oscillation frequency can be increased by 75% compared to the original structure without enhanced edge. Our results may be useful for overcoming the frequency limit of the skyrmion-based spin-torque oscillator, which utilizes the current-induced oscillation of a skyrmion as the source of microwave power.

NIC-planarity generalizes IC-planarity, which allows a vertex to be incident to at most one crossing edge, and specializes 1-planarity, which only requires at most one crossing each edge. It is known that any 1-planar (NIC-planar) graph of order n has at most 4n - 8 (3.6n - 7.2) edges and that this bound is tight. In this paper, we show that every 1-planar (NIC-planar) graph of order n with a dominating vertex has at most 4n - 9 (3.5n - 7.5) edges and this bound is tight for infinitely many values of n. Moreover, we derive tight upper bounds on the density of G, if G + 2P(1) and G + P-2 are 1-planar (NIC-planar), respectively. These results improve some previous results due to Czap et al. and partially answer their open problem in negative. In addition, we also provide a complete characterization of outer 1-planarity of join of two graphs. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

In this paper, based on the 3D coordinates of the atoms in the molecule, the spin-spin coupling constants of atom-pairs are directly predicted using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The calculated result of DFT method is taken as the target value. Experiment shows that LightGBM (R-2: 0.93) overall performance is better than XGBoost. In some molecules, the predicted fit (R-2) of the coupling constant between atoms even reached 1.00. This research avoids complex quantum mechanics and can assist in NMR to gain insight into the structure and dynamics of molecules, thereby enriching the data information analysis method of nuclear magnetic interaction.

Here, ultrafine and well-dispersed Rh nanoparticles (NPs) (1.92 nm in diameter) were synthesized and fixed on nitrogen (N)-doped carbon nanotubes with encapsulated nickel NPs (Rh/Ni@NCNTs) by a simple and sustainable strategy without any organic solvents, capping agents, and reducing agents. Rh/Ni@NCNTs with a low Rh loading of 2.84 wt% exhibited an outperforming catalytic activity with overpotentials of 14, 26, and 45 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in 1.0 M KOH, 1.0 M PBS, and 0.5 M H2SO4, respectively. Moreover, Rh/Ni@NCNTs displayed a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.67 s(-1) at 100 mV in alkaline solution. The high HER performance should be attributed to the catalytically active nature of metal Rh, unique structure characteristics of Ni@NCNTs induced positive synergistic effects with the anchored Rh NPs, and metal Ni promoted N-rich feature of Rh/Ni@NCNTs. The NCNTs with ultrathin wrinkle graphitic carbon walls could efficiently wrap the as-synthesized ultrasmall Rh NPs, prohibiting their aggregations and leading to high stability and durability of Rh/Ni@NCNTs. The present study may open a new frontier for preparing high-dispersed and high-active HER catalyst.

To address this problem, inspired by the degradation mechanism of aerobic bacteria toward organic pollutants, a novel photodegradation system was presented and operated by a heterojunction photocatalyst combining with a hydrophobic triphase interface, allowing oxygen to directly diffuse from the gas phase to active catalytic sites submersed in polluted solutions. Especially, the heterojunction photocatalyst was fabricated by graphitic carbon nitride nanosheets (C3N4 NS) sensitized with 5,10,15,20-tetrakis(4-carboxylphenyl)-porphyrin (TCPP). The resulting photocatalyst was coated on a certain part of the commercial superhydrophobic carbon paper (CP) and submersed in the polluted wastewater, while the other part of hydrophobic CP (without coating with C3N4-TCPP nanocomposite) was exposed to air to form a gas-liquid-solid tri-phase photodegradation system. With this system, the photodegradation rate was 10-fold higher than that of a conventional liquid/solid diphase system in oxygen-saturated solutions. This was, on one hand, due to the abundant oxygen on the surface of a photocatalyst coming from the fast and direct diffusion from the gas phase through the superhydrophobic nanoporous part of CP. On the other hand, the hybrid C3N4-TCPP nanocomposite enhanced the light absorption efficiency under simulated sunlight irradiation and restrained the recombination of photogenerated electron-hole. Moreover, the triphase photodegradation system was stable in aqueous solutions for a long time and can be reused almost without attenuation for five cycles, which provided a great potential to be utilized for practical wastewater treatment.

The asymmetric generation of acyclic products containing all-carbon quaternary stereocenters from substituted 1,3-dienes represents a more challenging, but highly desirable, synthetic process for which there are very few examples. Herein, we report the highly selective copper-catalyzed generation of chiral all-carbon acyclic quaternary stereocenters via functionalization of 1,3-dienes with CO2. A variety of readily available 1,1-disubstituted 1,3-dienes, as well as a 1,3,5-triene, undergo reductive hydroxymethylation with high chemo-, regio-, E/Z-, and enantioselectivities. The reported method features good functional group tolerance, is readily scaled up to at least 5 mmol of starting diene, and generates chiral products that are useful building blocks for further derivatization. Systemic mechanistic investigations using density functional theory calculations were performed and provided the first theoretical investigation for an asymmetric transformation involving CO2. These computational results indicate that the 1,2-hydrocupration of 1,3-diene proceeds with high pi-facial selectivity to generate an (S)-allylcopper intermediate, which further induces the chirality of the quaternary carbon center in the final product. The 1,4-addition of an internal allylcopper complex, which differs from previous reports involving terminal allylmetallic intermediates, to CO2 kinetically determines the E/Z- and regioselectivity. The rapid reduction of a copper carboxylate intermediate to the corresponding silyl-ether in the presence of Me(MeO)(2)SiH provides the exergonic impetus and leads to chemoselective hydroxymethylation rather than carboxylation. These results provide new insights for guiding further development of asymmetric C-C bond formations with CO2.

Meanwhile, to consider human's hesitance, the concept of q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy set (q-ROHFS) is presented, which can be more valid for handling real multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. To fuse the information in q-ROHFS more effectively, in this article, based on power average (PA) operator and generalised Heronian mean (GHM) operator, some q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy power generalised Heronian mean (q-ROHFPGHM) operators which can consider the relationships between being fused arguments are defined and studied. Evidently, the new proposed operators can obtain more exact results than other existing methods. In addition, some precious properties of these operators are discussed. Afterwards, the defined aggregation operators are used to MADM with q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy numbers (q-ROHFNs) and the MADM decision-making model is developed. In accordance with the defined operators and built model, the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted power generalised Heronian mean (q-ROHFWPGHM) operator and the q-rung orthopair hesitant fuzzy weighted power generalised geometric Heronian mean (q-ROHFWPGGHM) operator are applied to deal with green supplier selection in supply chain management, and the availability and superiority of the proposed operators are analysed by comparing with some existing approaches. The method presented in this paper can effectually solve the MADM problems which the decision-making information is expressed by q-ROHFNs and the attributes are interactive.

However, the radical precursors and pathways to generate radicals in such processes are still limited. Herein, we report the first Cu-catalyzed selective oxy-cyanoalkylation of allylamines with cycloketone oxime esters and CO2 via C-C bond cleavage. Many cyanoalkyl-substituted 2-oxazolidinones are obtained in moderate to good yields with high regio- and chemo-selectivities. The utility of this redox-neutral and cyanide-free method is demonstrated with mild conditions, broad substrate scope, good functional group tolerance and easy scalability.

The correlation between charting statistics or regions could be considerably important in monitoring the states of multiple outcomes or regions. In addition, the process variable distribution is unknown in most situations. In this paper, we propose a new nonparametric strategy for multivariate process monitoring when the distribution of a process variable is unknown. We discuss the EWMA control chart based on rank methods for a multivariate process, and the approach is completely nonparametric. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed method is efficient in detecting shifts for multivariate processes.

Firstly, the fundamental concepts, operation formulas and distance calculating method of 2TLNNs are introduced. Then some aggregation operators of 2TLNNs are reviewed. Thereafter, the original VIKOR method is extended to 2TLNNs and the calculating steps of VIKOR method with 2TLNNs are proposed. In the proposed method, it's more reasonable and scientific for considering the conflicting criteria. Furthermore, the VIKOR are extended to interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic numbers (IV2TLNNs). Moreover, a numerical example for green supplier selection has been given to illustrate the new method and some comparisons are also conducted to further illustrate advantages of the new method.

Here, we report the preparation of ultrafine, surface-clean, and well-distributed Ru NPs and concomitant formation of nitride carbon (Ru/NC) by pyrolyzing tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(ii) chloride (TBRC) with carbon. The use of the nitrogen (N)-containing Ru complex of TBRC as the metal precursor is essential for the preparation of ultrafine and highly dispersed Ru NPs (1.20 nm in diameter) on a NC support. The as-synthesized Ru/NC-800 displays superior analytical performance for non-enzymatic detection of H2O2 with a low detection limit of 0.468 mu M, high sensitivity of 698 mu A mM(-1) cm(-2), excellent linear detection ranging from 0.001 to 10.000 mM, good stability, and high selectivity. The control experiment results indicate that the high-performance of Ru/NC-800 must be ascribed to the ultrasmall and highly dispersed Ru NPs and N-doping, which can supply a higher density of active sites available for H2O2 detection. This study provides a facile strategy to synthesize ultrafine metal NPs and for concomitant production of NC for electrocatalytic non-enzymatic sensing.

Experimental evidence of crystal symmetry protection for the topological nodal line semimetal state in ZrSiS	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							PRESSURE; MAGNETORESISTANCE; ABSENCE; PHASE	Tunable symmetry breaking plays a crucial role for the manipulation of topological phases of quantum matter. Here, through combined high-pressure magnetotransport measurements, Raman spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction, we demonstrate a pressure-induced topological phase transition in nodal-line semimetal ZrSiS. Symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations suggest that this pressure-induced topological phase transition may be attributed to weak lattice distortions by nonhydrostatic compression, which breaks some crystal symmetries, such as the mirror and inversion symmetries. This finding provides some experimental evidence for crystal symmetry protection for the topological semimetal state, which is at the heart of topological relativistic fermion physics.	[Gu, C.

The intermolecular interaction energy, transport, and hydrogen bonding dynamics of the mixture reflecting the nonlinear dielectric response were measured. We observed a distinct threshold effect in which the intermolecular interaction energy, hydrogen bonding lifetime, diffusion coefficient, and the viscosity of the mixture were increased or decreased dramatically when the intensity of the microwave field exceeded a certain value. The present study also shows that the loss of microwave energy due to friction between the molecules cannot be ignored. This work reveals the extent of non-thermal microwave effects in the DMSO-Methanol mixture. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

We also evaluated drivers' perceptions in different situations to understand the occurrence of unreasonable driving behaviors. Methods: Two self-administered questionnaires were used to calculate participants' personality dimensions and driving style scores, respectively. Two experimental tasks were conducted by driving simulator with different weather, light, and speed of the opposing through vehicles. Results: Results showed that personality was significantly related to driving style. Neither the left-turn response process nor gap acceptance maneuvers were directly influenced by light conditions. In the test area, the average speed and the minimum speed of the left-turning vehicle, as well as the distance of the vehicle from the collision point when the speed is the smallest were significantly related to the weather, interaction type, and velocity difference, and the time to collision during which first brake or release gas pedal occurs was significantly related to velocity difference. Three out of the four driving conditions (except for light conditions) exhibited a statistically significant effect on the judgment of the arrival time of autonomous vehicles and their risk assessment, and personality was significantly related to risk assessment. Moreover, dangerous driving behavior was found to be significantly associated with drivers' driving personality. Conclusions: The driving style is dynamic and influenced by personality and driving conditions. Not only the wrong assessment of driving scenarios may lead to danger, but also the driver's personality characteristics such as self-interest, impulsively, and lack of self-confidence will lead to decision-making mistakes even when the judgment of driving scenarios is correct.

Unfortunately, CoMoO4 anode also has some drawbacks such as low electronic/ionic conductivity, inferior cyclic stability, and relative severe volumetric expansion during the lithiation/delithiation process, greatly inhibiting its further development and application. Herein, we report Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C nanosheet composite constructed via a novel and facile onestone-three-birds strategy. The preparation of the Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C nanosheet is based on the following two-step process: the formation of Co/Zn nanosheet precursors derived from Co/Zn-ZIF rhombic dodecahedra via solvothermal pretreatment, followed by a calcination treatment with molybdic acid (H2MoO4) in air. The as-prepared Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C is monoclinic crystal structured composite with the in situ formed active carbon, which is well-defined nanosheet with a rough surface and mean thickness of 60-70 nm for a single sheet. This Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C nanosheet composite possesses a larger surface area of 37.60 m(2) g(-1), showing a mesoporous structure. When used as anode materials, the as-obtained Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C composite can deliver as high as a discharge capacity of 1337 mAh g(-1) after 300 cycles at 0.2C and still retain the capacity of 827 mAh g(-1) even after 600 cycles at 1C, exhibiting outstanding lithium storage performances. The higher capacity and superior cyclic stability of the Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C composite should be ascribed to the synergistic effect of the substitution of Zn2+, in situ composited active carbon and the as-constructed unique microstructure for the Co0.8Zn0.2Mo0.4/C composite. Our present work provides a facile one-stone-three-birds strategy to effectively construct the architectures and significantly enhance electrochemical performances for other transition metal electrode materials.

This group is generally widespread and, despite never occurring in large quantities, represents the major economic light rare earth element (LREE) mineral in deposits related to carbonatite and alkaline intrusions. Since bastnasite is easily altered and commonly contains inclusions of earlier-crystallised minerals, in situ analysis is considered the most suitable method to measure its U-Th-Pb and Sr-Nd isotopic compositions. Electron probe microanalysis and laser ablation (multi-collector) inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry of forty-six bastnasite samples from LREE deposits in China, Pakistan, Sweden, Mongolia, USA, Malawi and Madagascar indicate that this mineral typically has high Th and LREE and moderate U and Sr contents. Analysis of an in-house bastnasite reference material (K-9) demonstrated that precise and accurate U-Th-Pb ages could be obtained after common Pb correction. Moreover, the Th-Pb age with its high precision is preferable to the U-Pb age because most bastnasites have relatively high Th rather than U contents. These results will have significant implications for understanding the genesis of endogenous ore deposits and formation processes related to metallogenic geochronology research.

The growing use of AgNPs products results that they can be inevitably released into the environment. Additionally, silver (Ag+) can easily find its way to the environmental waters from AgNPs. To gain deep insight into the transformation between AgNPs and Ag+ in the organisms or environment, and evaluate the toxicity of AgNPs and Ag+, various speciation analysis methods are developed. This paper presents a brief and systemic review for the speciation analysis of AgNPs and Ag+ based on the recently developed separation techniques coupled with atomic spectroscopy, including extraction method, chromatographic method, cation exchange reaction (CER) and single particles (SP) detection. Future perspectives in this field are also discussed.

Schneider (Asteraceae, Astereae) was known only from the holotype locality after having been collected in 1908. Its systematic position and relationships among Aster and related genera remained unknown. In this work, we report the rediscovery of Aster polius at the type locality in western Sichuan, China, in 2016. After a detailed comparison with herbarium specimens and a phylogenetic reconstruction of densely sampled relatives based on nuclear markers (nrITS & nrETS), the position of Aster polius was determined to be in Aster ser. Albescentes. This species differs from other species of A. ser.

Here we report ultrathin amorphous CoFeP nanosheets derived from CoFe layered double hydroxides (LDHs) as bifunctional electrocatalysts with a simple phosphorization method. The partial phosphating induced by sodium hypophosphite can greatly reduce the thickness of nanosheets and promote the polycrystalline nature of the materials, leading to more active sites exposed and faster electronic transport. The optimal levels of phosphating agents are 1.8 g for OER and 2.4 g for HER, respectively, etched by which the resultant CoFeP materials can exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performances toward OER, HER and overall water splitting in alkaline media. At the current densities of 100 and 20 mA cm(-2), ultralow overpotentials of 242 and 80 mV are achieved for OER and HER, individually, which are 128 mV lower than RuO2 and 6 mV slightly lower than Pt, respectively. In a cell voltage of 1.62 V, the CoFeP materials reacted with 1.8 and 2.4 g phosphating agents and used as the anode and the cathode, respectively, can achieve 100 mA cm(-2) current density and exhibit extraordinary durability for 30 h in overall water splitting. These superior electrocatalytic properties of ultrathin amorphous CoFeP nanosheets are comparable to those of state-ofthe-art noble metal and other reported catalysts for OER, HER and overall water splitting. This work proposes a promising strategy for excellent bifunctional electrocatalysts by tailoring the morphology and crystallinity degree based on LDHs through a facile partial phosphating method.

In this study, removal of organic contaminants in concentrated landfill leachate was investigated by applying the ferrous ion (Fe2+) catalyzed O-3/H2O2 process. The maximum chemical oxygen demand (COD) and absorbance at 254 nm (UV254) removal efficiencies under the optimal conditions (initial pH = 3.0, Fe2+ dosage = 6.500 mM, H2O2 dosage = 18.8 mM and O-3 dosage = 52.65 mg min(-1)) were 48.82% and 63.59%, respectively. These were higher than those achieved using the Fe2+/O-3, O-3/H2O2, and O-3 processes, and biodegradability of the leachate was improved significantly. Moreover, compared with other processes, the Fe2+ had a stronger catalytic effect. Molecular distribution analysis and three-dimensional excitation and emission matrix analysis both indicated that the fulvic acid and humic acid in the concentrated leachate were greatly degraded. Ultraviolet-visible spectra showed that the Fe2+/O-3/H2O2 process mainly destroyed unsaturated bonds and decreased the aromatic degree of the leachate. The reaction mechanism of the Fe2+/O-3/H2O2 process mainly was attributed to three factors: (1) O-3 and H2O2 reacting to produce (OH)-O-center dot; (2) H2O2 and O-3 decomposing into (OH)-O-center dot through the oxidation of Fe2+ to Fe3+; and (3) coagulation by Fe (OH)(3). The (OH)-O-center dot can rapidly degrade recalcitrant organics, and coagulation also increases the removal of organic matter. Therefore, the Fe2+/O-3/H2O2 process was an effective method for treating concentrated landfill leachate.

However, its widespread applications are significantly prohibited by the low reductivity and high cost of support. To overcome these shortcomings, a porous carbon (PC) is herein developed as a promising matrix for the electroless deposition of metal NPs. Benefiting from abundant oxygen-based surface functional groups, the PC shows stronger reducibility (low redox potential) than conventional carbon substrate such as carbon nanotubes or graphene oxide, enabling a facile electroless deposition of Ir, Rh, and Ru NPs on its surface. These SMNPs exhibit an impressive electrocatalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) or hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR). For example, the Rh NP/PC can deliver an HER current density of 10 mA cm(-2) with a small overpotential of 21 mV in 0.5 m H2SO4, while the Ru NP/PC exhibits excellent HOR activity in 0.1 m KOH in terms of high mass and surface specific exchange current density of 263 A g(Ru)(-1) and 0.227 mA cm(Ru)(-2). The present strategy may open up opportunities for mass production of efficient supported NPs for diverse applications.

The cooperative effects of the alkali metal cation size and lone pairs resulted in a different symmetry for these two title compounds. The compound K2SO4 center dot(SbF3)(2) crystallized in a centrosymmetric (CS) space group of P2(1)/c, while Rb2SO4 center dot(SbF3)(2) crystallized in the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group of P2(1). Though both of these two compounds consisted of similar structural building units, [SbF3O2](4-) tetragonal pyramid complexes and [SO4](2-) tetrahedra, they displayed discrepant helix columns in the crystal structure due to the different steric hindrance forces produced by the alkali metal cations. The alkali metal cations K+/Rb+ provided a charge balance and connected the different helix columns to form the three-dimensional framework. The detailed characterizations revealed that Rb2SO4 center dot(SbF3)(2) was a potential ultraviolet nonlinear optical material. In addition, theoretical calculations were performed.

In the latter, analogy with red-wine-doped FeTe1-x S-x superconductors has been proposed. Wereport a novel T-XRD investigation of red-wine-doped-HOPG at the magic angle (average theta(misfit) between the layers similar to 0.8 degrees as revealed by TEM and Moire pattern analyses) from 77 K to 673 K. Anomalous T-induced depletion in the intensity of the 004 HOPG-reflection from 77 K to 348 K is demonstrated. Similar depletion features could be also found in comparative measurements performed in water doped HOPG samples. Significant deviation from the linear c-axis expansion predicted by the alpha-factor is shown together with a depletion in the graphitic c-axis shift-values for wine doped samples. EPR analyses are also provided and reveal a transition at 77 K implying possible presence of a change in the magnetic ordering (i.e. ferromagnetism) at low temperature. VSM analyses supported further the T-XRD results, by revealing presence of magnetic transition at approx. 350 K together with unusual superconductive-like hysteretic features at 250 K and 300 K which are not compatible with ferromagnetism.

J	Yin, SB; Wang, YB; Yang, YEH				Yin, Shibai; Wang, Yibin; Yang, Yee-Hong			A Novel Residual Dense Pyramid Network for Image Dehazing	ENTROPY			English	Article						image dehazing; residual dense pyramid; encoder-decoder; convolutional neural network	FRAMEWORK	Recently, convolutional neural network (CNN) based on the encoder-decoder structure have been successfully applied to image dehazing. However, these CNN based dehazing methods have two limitations: First, these dehazing models are large in size with enormous parameters, which not only consumes much GPU memory, but also is hard to train from scratch. Second, these models, which ignore the structural information at different resolutions of intermediate layers, cannot capture informative texture and edge information for dehazing by stacking more layers. In this paper, we propose a light-weight end-to-end network named the residual dense pyramid network (RDPN) to address the above problems. To exploit the structural information at different resolutions of intermediate layers fully, a new residual dense pyramid (RDP) is proposed as a building block. By introducing a dense information fusion layer and the residual learning module, the RDP can maximize the information flow and extract local features. Furthermore, the RDP further learns the structural information from intermediate layers via a multiscale pyramid fusion mechanism. To reduce the number of network parameters and to ease the training process, we use one RDP in the encoder and two RDPs in the decoder, following a multilevel pyramid pooling layer for incorporating global context features before estimating the final result. The extensive experimental results on a synthetic dataset and real-world images demonstrate that the new RDPN achieves favourable performance compared with some state-of-the-art methods, e.g., the recent densely connected pyramid dehazing network, the all-in-one dehazing network, the enhanced pix2pix dehazing network, pixel-based alpha blending, artificial multi-exposure image fusions and the genetic programming estimator, in terms of accuracy, run time and number of parameters.

Likewise, the Fenton process is a classic wastewater treatment method, but requires strict pH control and produces secondary pollution when the concentration of organic substances is high. In this study, we applied a 1stO(3)-2ndFenton sequential process to treat diazodinitrophenol (DDNP) industrial wastewater and provide suitable reaction conditions for Fenton process. For the 1stOzone process, organics removal increased as O-3 dosage increased. At optimized operation, the 1stO(3) process provided an acidic effluent (pH = 3) and reduced the organics concentration to a level suitable for the 2ndFenton process. Benzene ring substances as well as nitro group and diazo group compounds were greatly degraded in the 1stO(3) process and were further mineralized in the 2ndFenton process. Additionally, the biodegradability of DDNP industrial wastewater was greatly improved. This is the first reported time that ozonation and the Fenton process have been integrated sequentially to treat an explosive production wastewater. The study provides a feasible chemical oxidation method for treating DDNP industrial wastewater by simply combining two classic treatment processes.

The partly unknown transition rates generalize the traditional works that are with all known transition rates. Then, a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) with a delay-product-type (DPT) term is constructed. The DPT term is not only simple but also fully utilizes the information of time delay. Based on the new DPT LKF, stability criteria are presented, which are with lower computational complexity and less conservative. In the end, the validity and superiorities of the analytical results are verified by several examples.

Firstly, some basic concepts of dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic elements (DHFLEs) and operational rules of Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm are introduced. Secondly, some general operators about the DHFLEs are developed based on Archimedean t-norm and t-conorm, such as the Archimedean t-norm- and t-conorm-based dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted averaging operator, Archimedean t-norm- and t-conorm-based dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted geometric operator, Archimedean t-norm- and t-conorm-based generalized dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic weighted averaging operator, Archimedean t-norm- and t-conorm-based generalized dual hesitant fuzzy weighted geometric operator, which operates without loss of information, and some desirable properties of those new operators are studied in detail. Furthermore, an approach based on the proposed operators under dual hesitant fuzzy linguistic decision-making problem is presented. Finally, an example is used to show the practical advantages of the proposed method and a sensitivity analysis of the decision results is also showed as the parameter changes.

Thus, in this study, the electronic structure, magnetic properties, and optical properties of GaSb, which has exhibited half-metallicity, doped with Mn, a 3d transition metal, are calculated using the generalized gradient approximation and Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) functional. Ga1-xMnxSb (x = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75) materials exhibit ferromagnetic half-metallic properties and a high Curie temperature, indicating that this series can be applied in spintronic devices.

Most of the existing systems focus on modeling single type of crowd movements, while ignoring the impact of psychological factors on the population. This paper proposes an emotional contagion-based model to simulate the peer decision-making in emergency evacuation. Firstly, the peer behaviors are simulated by integrating emotion contagion and intimacy-based decision-making. Secondly, the intimacy coefficient is introduced into emotion contagion by mapping the PAD sentiment model and OCC emotion recognition model. Thirdly, based on the environmental familiarity, individuals who are familiar with the environment have a higher probability to find their peers. Finally, they will decide whether to make a peer decision based on the difficulty of the searching task, the ability to find the peers, etc. Through quantitative and qualitative experiments, experimental results show that the proposed system can simulate the peer behaviors during emergency evacuation.

We conducted a warming and N deposition manipulation experiment using a 2 x 2 full-factorial design to evaluate the interactive effects of soil warming and N deposition on R-s, microbial community composition and soil organic carbon (SOC) composition in a subalpine coniferous forest on the eastern slope of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Soil warming and N addition independently increased R-s and changed microbial community composition, resulting in a net increase in bacteria with N addition and an increase in protozoa with warming; but the interaction of these two factors proved to be antagonistic, resulting in a lower R-s and protozoa concentration in the combined warming and nitrogen addition (WN) treatment relative to the warming (W) treatment. The chemical structure of SOC changed with the treatments, with alkyl C increased with warming, aromatic C decreased with both warming and N addition, and the interaction of warming and N induced a lower O-alkyl C and a higher contribution of alkyl C to SOC. The negative correlation between R-s and aromatic C and the positive correlation between R-s and alkyl C and MBC indicates that the elevated CO2 emission under warming and N addition was related to the decomposition of aromatic C and the following relative accumulation of alkyl C. Our observations suggest that climate induced soil warming will likely increase soil CO2 emissions, but this effect could be largely offset by a simultaneous increase in N deposition in subalpine coniferous forests.

Then, the concentrated OTC on the surface of Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 was oxidized by Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4/O-2 Fenton-like process at pH of 3 with high solid-water ratio, which can reduce the amount of acid used for adjusting pH for Fenton reaction. Approximately 98.6% of OTC was oxidized at initial OTC concentration of 100 mg/L by the two-step process, which was higher than that by the one-step process of adsorption-oxidation at pH 3 or pH 6. The used Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 in two-step process could be reused after Zn-0 was reloaded. The removal efficiency of OTC decreased only 6.7% after four-recycle use of the Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4. The possible adsorption mechanism of OTC onto the Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 surface and the oxidation mechanism of the concentrated OTC by the Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4/O-2 process were proposed.

Here, three dominant montane forests in southern Tibet, namely Abies, Pinus and Picea forests, were heavily sampled from ca. 1700 to 4300 m asl to examine the altitudinal patterns in SOC and STN stocks and the co-varying effects of mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), tree species and soil type. Overall, SOC and STN stocks in the top 100 cm increased linearly by 54 Mg C/ha and 5 Mg N/ha per 1000 m altitude increase, respectively. The altitudinal trends resulted partly from the tree species shift with altitude, because Pinus forests dominated at lower altitudes (1709 to 3585 m asl) and had generally lower SOC and STN stocks than Abies forests, which dominated at higher altitudes (2615 to 4217 m asl). SOC and STN stocks increased with altitude in Abies (most pronounced) and Pinus forests, whereas no clear altitudinal trend was observed in Picea forests. Soil type was another controlling factor. SOC and STN stocks under similar soil types for each tree species showed universally increasing trends with increasing altitude. All the observed altitudinal trends in SOC and STN stocks were primarily controlled by decreasing MAT with increasing altitude. Our results therefore emphasize that soil C and N of montane forest may be sensitive to future global warming, especially at higher altitudes, currently dominated by Abies forest.

Due to the disturbance and influence of the fractional Laplacian operator on a bounded interval interacting with the degenerate noise, the study of the system becomes more complicated. In order to get over the difficulties caused by the fractional Laplacian operator, the usual Hilbert space does not fit the system, we introduce an appropriate weighted space to study it. Meanwhile, we apply the asymptotically strong Feller property instead of the usually strong Feller property to overcome the trouble caused by the degenerate noise, the corresponding Malliavin operator is not invertible. We finally derive the uniqueness of the invariant measure which further implies the ergodicity of the stochastic system.

This title compound crystallizes in a polar noncentrosymmetric (NCS) space group (P2(1)) and presents a complicated three-dimensional (3D) network composed of SbO3F3, Rb-centered distorted polyhedra and p-conjugated planar triangular NO3 groups. Rb3SbF3(NO3)(3) is a potential UV nonlinear optical material due to its large phasematchable second harmonic generation (SHG) response of approximately 2.2 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and a wide band gap of 3.75 eV. Theoretical calculation analysis was used to rationalize the large SHG effect, which originates from the multi-component synergistic effect including moderately polarizable Rb+ cations, a stereochemically active lone pair effect of Sb3+ and NO3 groups with a p-conjugated planar triangular structure.

The understanding of the pinning and depinning of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion to defects is a prerequisite for skyrmion-based in-line motion applications, such as racetrack memory. Here, we numerically study the effect of two types of defects caused by the local decrease/increase of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy on the current-induced dynamics of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion, where the critical depinning current density of the skyrmion motion for different defects is determined under the framework of micromagnetics. We also provide an explanation for the complex behaviors of the antiferromagnetic skyrmion via energy landscape, which shows that the skyrmion always prefers to stay at a specific place with minimal energy. Furthermore, the current-induced motion of a skyrmion in an antiferromagnetic racetrack with defects is compared to that in a ferromagnetic racetrack. Our results are useful for the understanding of antiferromagnetic skyrmion physics at low temperatures and could provide guidelines for designing applications based on antiferromagnetic skyrmions.

However, negative connections between connector hubs are removed by traditional hard-thresholding approach in graph-theoretical research. Using soft-thresholding approach to reserve negative links, we explore time-varying features of connector hubs in intermodular communications during cognitive control of affective pictures. We develop a novel approach to sparse functional networks and construct negatively linking connector networks for positive, negative, and neutral pictures. We find that consisting of flexible hubs, the frontoparietal system dynamically top-down inhibits neural activities through negative connections from the salience subnetwork and visual processing area. Moreover, the shared connectors form functional backbones that dynamically reconfigure according to differently-valenced pictures in order to coordinate both stability and flexibility of cognitive connector networks. These results reveal the necessity of conserving negative links between intermodular communications in chronnectome research and deepen the understanding of how connector networks dynamically evolute during cognitive control of affective processing.

In most of the existing NLSs, the intrinsic properties of nodal lines are greatly destroyed because nodal lines usually suffer sizable gaps induced by non-negligible spin-orbit coupling (SOC). In this work, we propose the topological nodal line electrides (TNLEs), which achieve electronic structures of nodal lines and electrides simultaneously, and provide new insight into designing excellent NLSs nearly immune from SOC. Since the states near the Fermi level are mostly contributed by non-nucleus-bound interstitial electrons, nodal lines in TNLEs manifest an extremely small SOC-induced gap even possessing heavy elements. In particular, we propose that the family of A(2)B (A = Ca, Sr, Ba; B = As, Sb, Bi) materials are realistic TNLEs with negligible SOC-induced gaps, which can act as excellent platforms to study the intrinsic properties of TNLEs.

TL-LaOBiS2 is composed of a middle LaO layer and top-and-bottom BiS2 layers that can be possibly exfoliated from its bulk counterpart. We reveal that each BiS2 layer can hold spontaneous in-plane ferroelectric polarization that can be further enhanced by imposing extensive strain. Furthermore, we discover that TL-LaOBiS2 possesses unconventional inner-TL ferroelectric (FE), antiferroelectric (AFE) and orthogonal polarizations. The ground inner-TL AFE state can be flexibly driven into a nearly degenerate FE state. Moreover, the direct band gaps, optical absorption and the carrier mobilities of TL-LaOBiS2 can be effectively regulated by different ferroelectric polarization configurations.

MoO3 is one type of versatile transition metal oxide with a high work function, large electron affinity and wide band gap for potential applications in electronics, optoelectronics, batteries and electrochromic devices. Herein, we report the transition from nonvolatile memory to volatile threshold switching in single MoO3 nanobelts simply by changing the electrodes from Au to Ag. The one-dimensional (1D) alpha-MoO3 nanobelts are synthesized by a hydrothermal method and annealed under different atmospheres to adjust the concentration of oxygen vacancies. The prepared single MoO3 nanobelt is used to serve as the RS layer to construct lateral two-terminal RS devices. By using Au as the electrodes, the MoO3 nanobelts exhibit typical nonvolatile bipolar memory RS behaviors. On the other hand, bidirectional threshold RS properties can be achieved by employing Ag as the electrodes due to the large contact resistance between Ag and MoO3. More importantly, the threshold RS performance is significantly enhanced by annealing the nanobelts in N-2. The ON/OFF current ratio is increased up to 3 x 10(5) while the threshold voltage is decreased down to 0.75 V. These results demonstrate the diverse RS behaviors in single 1D MoO3 nanobelts and potential applications in volatile and non-volatile switching devices. In addition, the finding provides guidelines for improvement and/or alternation of RS behaviors through defect engineering and/or device modification in the multifunctional emerging devices.

The morphology, structure, and composition of samples are well characterized by scanning electron microscopy, X-ray powder diffraction, fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis, and elemental analyses, respectively. These well-arranged Eu-MOFs architectures show red emission corresponding to the D-5(0)/F-7(2) transition of the Eu3+ ions under UV light excitation. Remarkably, these Eu-MOFs samples exhibit clear "turn-off" quenching response for styrene vapors with high selectivity and reusability. This Eu-MOFs fluorescent sensor realizes fast recognition for styrene with a response time of less than 1 min at room temperature. Moreover, good detection reproductivity could also be achieved in this sensor. Considering the easy preparation, high selectivity and excellent repeatability, the sensor system provides a convenient and reliable detection of volatile organic compound in everyday applications.

Herein, the luminescent properties of CdTe quantum dots (QDs) were exploited, where CdTe QDs were used as shared signal molecules. Combining multiple types of nucleic acid and chemical signal amplification techniques, and various signal detection techniques, a magnetic nanoparticle (NP) and filter-assisted separation multimode sensing strategy has been developed. In this work, miRNA-141 was selected as a representative target, which can trigger the catalyzed hairpin assembly and hybrid chain reaction enzyme-free nucleic acid signal amplification that generates long double-stranded DNA. Subsequently, the chemical amplification of silver NPs (Ag NPs) that release a large amount of Ag+ was introduced into the system. Finally, the cation-exchange reaction between CdTe QDs and Ag was utilized to quench the fluorescence (FL) of the CdTe QDs, releasing free Cd2+. The visual/FL/chemical vapor generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVG-AFS)/inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) method could then be performed for the analysis of miRNA. After investigating its experimental performance, it has been found that 10 fM can be differentiated from the blank solution with the naked eye. In addition, FL/CVG-AFS/ICP-MS methods all displayed good analytical capability for target detection, and the limits of detection (LODs) are as low as fM, which show high target sequence selectivity. This platform was applied to investigate miRNA-141 expression in various cancer cells, which can accurately detect in the range of 100-100 000 MDA-MB-231 cells (breast cancer cell lines), with an LOD of 15 cells. Therefore, the multimode sensing strategy based on a single signal molecule and multiple signal amplification strategies is an applicable and versatile detection method of biomarkers; it can even achieve point-of-care testing, improving the accuracy and efficiency of medical diagnosis.

Firstly, we optimized the structures of monolayer M2C and computed the corresponding electronic band structures, the results show that they are metallic. And there exists Dirac points in the band structure, which make them may being potential candidates for investigating Dirac-physics-based applications. Secondly, we analyzed the phonon spectra combining with the corresponding projected phonon density of states of monolayer M2C. The results indicate that the three monolayers M2C are dynamically stable. The large energy gap between the optical phonon ZO and ZO' mode gets wider with the mass of translation metal increasing. Thirdly, the related thermodynamic properties, such as the Raman (E-g, A(1g)), infrared active (E-u, A(2u)) mode, Debye temperature, sound speed, temperature-dependent heat capacity, entropy, free energy and lattice thermal conductivity were also investigated. Finally, the planar elastic stiffness coefficients and other derived elastic properties of monolayer M2C were determined. We find that the Y-S value of Nb2C and Ta2C is larger than that of monolayer Ti2C (130N m(-1)). By using the uniaxial tensile, we obtained the stress-strain properties of monolayer M2C. The monolayer Ta2C has the strongest peak strength in the direction of armchair. Its maximum stress is 83GP at epsilon(arm) = 0.19. Thus, those MXene materials can be considered as extremely stiff 2D materials.

Safety of underground space has been an important aspect of urban safety. Due to the influences of global climate change and human activities, waterlogging disasters in cities are becoming increasingly serious and underground facilities easily suffer from waterlogging disasters. Moreover, waterlogging disasters in cities can cause different degrees of damage to construction period and operating period of urban subway stations. By using the optimal combination weighting method combining subjective and objective weighting, this study assigned weights to evaluation factors. Based on this, a fuzzy synthetic evaluation model for waterlogging risk in the construction and operating periods of urban subway stations was established. Furthermore, the model was applied and verified to be effective in Chengdu Metro Line 4, Sichuan province, China, and the evaluation results coincided with the actual situation. The model in the study provides a new idea for evaluating waterlogging risks in urban subway stations, and these results can offer important information for local government to strengthen management on waterlogging risks.

Here, we report the synthesis of ruthenium phosphide nanoparticles (NPs) confined into N/P dual-doped carbon by pyrolyzing self-prepared ruthenium-organo-phosphine complex using 1,3,5-triaza-7-phosphadamantane (PTA) as the ligand and N/P sources. The achieved S-RuP2/NPC displayed excellent electrocatalytic activity (over-potentials of 19, 37, and 49 mV in alkaline, neutral, and acidic media, respectively, at 10 mA cm(-2)) toward HER at all pH ranges. The high performance of S-RuP2/NPC must be ascribed to the homogeneously distributed and P-rich RuP(2)NPs with the diameter of 3.29 nm on the NPC surface, which can considerably improve the atom utilization for HER. The present synthetic strategy not only avoids the use of additional N/P sources but also the generation of flammable and toxic PH3 gas. This synthetic strategy can be extended to prepare other traditional metal phosphides for electrocatalytic applications. (C) 2019 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Under the control of David, Alice can implement an unknown single-qubit unitary operation on the remote Bob's quantum system, while Bob can execute a single-qubit unitary operation on Charlie's quantum system and Charlie can also perform an unknown single-qubit unitary operation on Alice's quantum system. Our scheme can be generalized to non >= 3) agents involved in the cycle to realize the transmission of single-qubit operations. Moreover, by replacing the quantum channels, we can change the cyclic direction of controlled qunatum operation teleportation (CQOT) from clockwise to counter-clockwise. In addition, we discuss our scheme in four types of noisy environments (amplitude-damping, phase-damping, bit-flip and phase-flip noisy environment), and use fidelity to analyze the amount of information lost in the process of CCQOT due to noise. The results show that the fidelity is determined by decoherence rate and amplitude parameters of the final state.

J	Pan, R; Wang, LL; Shanks, R; Liu, Y				Pan, Rui; Wang, Ling L.; Shanks, Robert; Liu, Yong			The Influence of Trisilanolisobutyl POSS on Domain Microstructure of a Polyurethane Hybrid Composite: A Molecular Simulation Approach	SILICON			English	Article						Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane; Molecular dynamics; Polyurethane	POLYHEDRAL OLIGOMERIC SILSESQUIOXANES; DYNAMICS SIMULATION; COPOLYMERS; NANOCOMPOSITES; POLYETHYLENE	A molecular dynamics simulation approach was adopted to investigate the domain microstructure of polyurethane (abbreviation PU) hybrid compositeswith trisilanolisobutyl polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (abbreviation TSI-POSS) covalently bonded to polymer chains. The accuracy of models and force field has been verified by wide-angle X-ray scattering and volume-temperature behavior analysis. TheWAXS results indicate that with TSIPOSS concentration increasing in PU hybrid composites, distinct crystallite clusters are formed which increase the volume of hard segments and lead to the microphase separation. Furthermore, details of chain packing have been evaluated by radial distribution function, which shows that below 13wt% TSI-POSS concentration, the number of contacts between neighboring chains is decreased due to the prominent cage of TSI-POSS. However, when TSI-POSS concentration is up to 22wt%, the number of contacts is increased because the formation of crystallite cluster pulls neighboring chains closer to each other and significantly shortens their distance. The mobility of the TSI-POSS cores and PU composite backbones has been determined by the mean square displacement. The result reveals that the incorporation of TSI-POSS as the rigid core in the polymer backbone apparently restricts motions of the surrounding chains, which is also supported by volume-temperature behavior analysis as the glass transition temperature of PU composites increases with rising TSI-POSS concentration.

S. albogriseolus LBX-2 is an aerobic and Gram-positive microorganism that is capable of using the polyethylene as the sole carbon source. Results of scanning electron microscopy and tensile tests indicated that S. albogriseolus LBX-2 could cause the damages to polyethylene (PE). Suspension culture of LBX-2 resulted in the weight loss in the PE powder over a 15-day period. The bacterial growth curve assay clearly demonstrated the utilization of n-hexadecane and n-octadecane for the strain LBX-2. Phylogenetic analysis showed that it was grouped in the same clade as S. albogriseolus belonging to Streptomyces. The complete genome of strain LBX-2 consists of a chromosome of 7,210,477 bp and a linear plasmid of 336,677 bp. Compared with other strains of Streptomyces, the genome size of S. albogriseolus LBX-2 was smaller than the average but its guanine and cytosine content (72.47%) was higher than the others. The Non-Redundant Protein Database (NR), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), SwissProt, Gene Ontology (GO) and Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) annotations provided information on the specific functions of encoded proteins. A total of 21 monooxygenase and 22 dioxygenase genes were found in its genome. Synteny comparison with the genome of Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2) revealed a low overall genetic diversity between them. This study provides valuable information to reveal the underlying mechanisms on PE degradation by S. albogriseolus LBX-2.

J	Lu, JP; Wei, C; Wu, J; Wei, GW				Lu, Jianping; Wei, Cun; Wu, Jiang; Wei, Guiwu			TOPSIS Method for Probabilistic Linguistic MAGDM with Entropy Weight and Its Application to Supplier Selection of New Agricultural Machinery Products	ENTROPY			English	Article						multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM); probabilistic linguistic term sets (PLTSs); information entropy; TOPSIS method; supplier selection; new agricultural machinery products	ATTRIBUTE DECISION-MAKING; INTUITIONISTIC FUZZY ENTROPY; AGGREGATION OPERATORS; TERM SETS; MEAN OPERATORS; TODIM METHOD; REPRESENTATION MODEL; PREFERENCE RELATIONS; CROSS-ENTROPY; VIKOR METHOD	In multiple attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems, uncertain decision information is well-represented by linguistic term sets (LTSs). These LTSs are easily converted into probabilistic linguistic sets (PLTSs). In this paper, a TOPSIS method is proposed for probabilistic linguistic MAGDM in which the attribute weights are completely unknown, and the decision information is in the form of probabilistic linguistic numbers (PLNs). First, the definition of the scoring function is used to solve the probabilistic linguistic entropy, which is then employed to objectively derive the attribute weights. Second, the optimal alternatives are determined by calculating the shortest distance from the probabilistic linguistic positive ideal solution (PLPIS) and on the other side the farthest distance of the probabilistic linguistic negative ideal solution (PLNIS). This proposed method extends the applications range of the traditional entropy-weighted method. Moreover, it doesn't need the decision-maker to give the attribute weights in advance. Finally, a numerical example for supplier selection of new agricultural machinery products is used to illustrate the use of the proposed method. The result shows the approach is simple, effective and easy to calculate. The proposed method can contribute to the selection of suitable alternative successfully in other selection problems.

This method was used in our manuscript which helps provide a larger effective viewing zone and higher angular resolution. In order to evaluate the differences quantitatively a mathematical model was built based on ABCD matrix. Applying this model, theoretical analysis showed good agreement with our experiments when estimating the distortion induced by curved pick-up method, and the means for distortion elimination was derived as well. Therefore this established model is helpful for the further investigation of Integral Imaging adopting curved pick-up method.

Studies in Western countries have provided some evidence of the relationship between the urban residents' perception of the recreational sports (RS), including perception of industry, space, experience, type, and support affecting recreational behaviors. Yet, evidence in China is not sufficient and, particularly, gender difference has not been discussed anywhere. Objectives: The present study aimed to see urban residents' perception of RS and its effect on recreational sport participation by the residents. Method: The study was conducted in three big cities (Hangzhou, Chengdu, and Shanghai) of China to test the association between the urban residents' perception of RS and their RS participation, in which gender differences were discussed. After taking their consent, a total of 764 participants (397 male and 367 female) aged from 15 to 65 were approached between April and October, 2018. The participants were given a survey to assess their perception and behavior of RS. T-test and the structural equation modeling were used to analyze gender differences in association between perception and behavior of RS. Results: For females, industry perception (beta = 0.17, p = 0.00), space perception (females: beta = 0.16, p = 0.00), and support perception (females: beta = 0.09, p = 0.03) had a significant positive effect on RS participation. For males, industry perception (males: beta = 0.13, p = 0.01) and type perception (males: beta = 0.23, p = 0.00) showed a significant positive impact on participation of RS. However, space perception of males (beta = -0.12; p = 0.01) and type perception of females (beta = -0.11; p = 0.01) are negatively associated with their RS participation. The perception of experience was the most important factor influencing RS behaviors. Significant gender differences have appeared in all five different perception factors. The industry perception has significant and positive effects on both males and females' RS participation. The type perception has significant positive effects on the male but negative on the female RS, while the space perception is just the opposite. The support perception has significant positive effects on the female RS practice but the influence is not obvious in the case of males. Conclusion: By adopting some measures, perception of RS may improve urban residents' participation in RS.

When participants accept unfair offers, the brain recruits a more bottom-up mechanism with a much stronger information flow from the visual cortex (O2) to the frontal area, but when they reject unfair offers, it displayed a more top-down flow derived from the frontal cortex (Fz) to the parietal and occipital cortices. Furthermore, we performed 2 additional studies to validate the above network models: one was to identify the 2 responses based on the out-degree information of network hub nodes, which results in 70% accuracy, and the other utilized theta burst stimulation (TBS) of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to modulate the frontal area before the decision-making tasks. We found that the intermittent TBS group demonstrated lower acceptance rates and that the continuous TBS group showed higher acceptance rates compared with the sham group. Similar effects were not observed after TBS of a control site. These results suggest that the revealed decision-making network model can serve as a potential intervention model to alter decision responses.

Recently, many efforts have been made to expand HG applications in non-atomic spectrometric methods due to its abilities of effective sample matrix separation, strong anti-interference capacity and high analyte transport efficiency. This work summarizes the developments, practical applications and recent trends in non-atomic spectrometric methods coupled with HG, including fluorescence and colorimetric methods, UV-vis spectrophotometry, chemiluminescence (CL), resonance Rayleigh scattering (RRS), and surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Moreover, during these years, HG has become an interesting and powerful technique in nanomaterials synthesis, which was widely used in spectral analysis. This review also shows a description of several hydride-regulated synthetic methods and their analytical applications. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It was found that in the O-3/H2O2 process, a certain increase in the O-3 and H2O2 dose and a higher initial pH promoted the removal of organics. In the MW/PS process, increasing the PS dosage and MW power increased the treatment efficiency, but a high ambient pH depressed the removal of organics, and base activation for PS was observed at pH = 13. Under optimum conditions, the chemical oxygen demand (COD) and color number (CN) removal efficiencies of O-3/H2O2 (O-3 dosage = 18.92 mg/min, H2O2 dose = 18 mM, and initial pH = 10) and MW/PS (PS dose = 8 g/L, MW power = 600 W, and initial pH = 3) were 93.81 and 90.01% (O-3/H2O2) and 82.29 and 77.89% (MW/PS). Ozone was the main oxidant responsible for organic degradation in the O-3/H2O2 process, while the hydroxyl radical ((OH)-O-center dot) played a lesser role. In the MW/PS process, both (OH)-O-center dot and the sulfate radical (SO4 center dot-) contributed to the degradation of organics, while SO4 center dot- was the dominant reactive oxygen species (ROS). In the treatment process, in terms of COD removal, MW/PS had a faster reaction rate due to the introduction of MWs, but its treatment efficiency was inferior to that of the O-3/H2O2 process. In addition, the O-3/H2O2 process performed better in terms of energy saving for reactions of less than 10 min. This study provides a theoretical reference for DDNP industrial wastewater treatment with two different AOPs. (C) 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers. Published by Elsevier B.V.

With the increasing demands of the modern workplace and a global trend of accountability in higher education, educators and employers pay great attention to the development of students' critical thinking skills throughout their training. Therefore, there is an urgent need worldwide for an updated and comprehensive assessment tool of college-level critical thinking. This paper reports on the preliminary validation for the Russian version of the HEIghten? Critical Thinking assessment developed by Educational Testing Service (ETS). Based on a large Russian college student sample (N?=?1060), we evaluated the psychometric quality of the items, individual and institution-level reliability, external validity, and student perceptions. Overall, the results suggested good psychometric quality, except that a few items showed low discriminating power and should be further examined with a second wave of data collection. IRT analyses revealed testlet effects and supported the essentially unidimensional structure of the measure.

Based on a range of computational simulation results. we assess factors that influence the effectiveness of interventions for reading, language, and other cognitive developmental disorders. The analysis provides a level of mechanistic detail that is generally lacking in behavioral approaches to intervention. We review an extended program of modeling work in four sections. In the first. we consider long-term outcomes and the possibility of compensated outcomes and resolution of early delays. In the second section. we address methods to remediate atypical development in a single network. In the third section, we address interventions to encourage compensation via alternative pathways. In the final section, we consider the key issue of individual differences in response to intervention. Together with advances in understanding the neural basis of developmental disorders and neural responses to training, formal computational approaches can spur theoretical progress to narrow the gap between the theory and practice of intervention.

Due to co-propagating of pump and Stokes lights, the Stokes pulse is effectively amplified in front segment of fiber, resulting in flatter gain distribution. As a proof-of-concept, FSBS-DBA based BOTDA sensing with distance of similar to 74.2 km, Brillouin frequency shift standard deviation of less than similar to 2 MHz and spatial resolution of similar to 10 m was demonstrated. This method is compatible and complementary with backward SBS-based DBA, and features better pumping efficiency than Raman amplification.

In conventional VBM, grayscale and morphological features of a dust image are commonly used. However, their measurement accuracy is limited by the atmospheric light scattering effect of surrounding light and the occlusion effect of dust particles. Thus, a high accuracy VBM system is investigated that is based on the relationship between dust concentration and image transmission (RCT) model. Meanwhile, a calculation method for image transmission that utilizes the atmospheric light scattering effect and the occlusion effect of dust particles is proposed in this paper. The experimental results show that in the proposed system, the relative error is +/- 3.0%, the relative uncertainty is 2.05%, the correlation is 0.99, the measurement range is 0.5-1000 mg/m(3), and the measurement period is 2 s. The RCT tends to be a negative correlation, which is a quadratic polynomial. The impact of the atmospheric light scattering effect and the occlusion effect of dust particles on measurement accuracy can be eliminated by utilizing image transmission. The proposed system can be used as an alternative measurement of dust concentration in the workshop.

The paper proposed a conceptual framework of vigor-pressure-organization-state-resilience-management (VPOSRM) and chose 22 indicators to establish the evaluation index system. The projection pursuit model optimized by quantum genetic algorithm was used to calculate comprehensive evaluating indicators. The results showed that Wuhan's Water Environmental Carrying Capacity (WECC) increased in 2006-2015 and the evaluation grade changed from grade IV unhealthy to grade III health. Through analysis the influence weights of indicators, per capital water resource, the proportion of irrigated area in commonly used cultivated land, water consumption of ten thousand Yuan industrial value-added, percentage of collective disposal of sewage and population density were top 5 indicators that affected Water Environmental Carrying Capacity significantly. By analysis the evaluation results, the improvement of WECC was attributed to the increase of daily sewage treatment capacity in resilience subsystem. The decrease of per capital water resources was the real reason for the change of WECC in 2010-2011. The development of agriculture and industry had put Wuhan city under great pressure for many years.

Here, 5-methylbenzotriazole modified graphene oxide (MBTA-GO) was used to adsorb U(VI) from aqueous solution. By the trials of different conditions, we found that the removal of U(VI) from acidic solution was strongly dependent on pH but independent of ionic strength. The U(VI) adsorption was perfectly conformed to the pseudo-second-order kinetics and the adsorption isotherms were simulated by the Langmuir model well. A high removal capacity (q(max) = 264 mg/g) for U(VI) at pH 3.5 was obtained. XPS, EXAFS analyses and DFT calculations revealed that the mechanism of uranium capture was ascribed to (i) the surface complexation by benzotriazole and carboxyl groups (providing lone pair electrons) on MBTA-GO and (ii) enhanced synergistic coordination ability of delocalized pi-bond of triazole group toward U due to the transfer of electrons from graphene sheet to benzotriazole. DFT calculations further demonstrated that benzotriazole displayed stronger binding with U(VI) compared to carboxyl group due to higher binding energy of [Side/Surface-U-MBTA-GO] (79.745, 54.986 kcal/mol) than [MBTA-GO-COOH -U] (27.131 kcal/mol). This work will provide valuable insight into designing novel nitrogen-containing adsorbents for practical application in wastewater treatment. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Herein, MIL-100 was prepared, characterized, and utilized for the adsorptive removal of diclofenac sodium (DCF) from aqueous solutions. A high monolayer adsorption capacity of 773 mg g(-1) was recorded. The adsorption mechanism was proposed based on different contributions of two types of pore structure of MIL-100 to the adsorption of DCF from aqueous solutions according to the experimental results and theoretical calculation. During adsorption process, DCF (5.2 x 7.4 x 10.3 angstrom) diffused through the free area of hexagonal pores (8.6 x 8.6 angstrom) into the cages of MIL-100, whilst it was adsorbed by the pentagonal pores (4.8 x 5.8 angstrom) preferentially. Internal mass transfer resistance, which was identified as one of the dominant rate-limiting steps by the mass transfer resistance kinetic models based on the Sips model, will be derived from the diffusion process, which was affected by the size-sieving effect of the pore structure of MIL-100. The successful diffusion of DCF into the interior of MIL-100 and the stable configuration between MIL-100 and DCF accounted for the high adsorption capacity. The capture of DCF into MIL-100 also resulted in the pore size distribution variation of adsorbent, which provided vital experimental evidence for the proposed mechanism. This study may offer deeper insights into other pollutants removal by metal-organic frameworks type adsorbents. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The allium giganteum-like architectures are made up of a large amount of nano-sheets. The morphology and grain size of the samples can be easily adjusted through the elaborate choice of reaction time and the content of PVP additives. A possible growth mechanism is proposed in detail. Under the UV light excitation, the Y-MOFs: xEu (x = 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50%) samples exhibit a strong red luminescence. The luminescence intensity increases first and then decreases with x value increasing, showing a maximum at x = 10%. Furthermore, the shape-preserved Y2O3:Eu3+ phosphors can be easily obtained via a heat-treating in the air using the corresponding MOFs as a precursor, which exhibit characteristic red emission and excellent thermal stability.

The magnetic reversal starts with the nucleation of the domain wall near the defects or soft phases, which ends by the pinning usually in the same place. Therefore, pinning near the nucleation centers are the dominant coercivity mechanism for both exchange-coupled nanocomposites and so-called single-phased permanent magnets. Our proposed coercivity mechanism and calculated results agree very well with available experimental data, especially the recently reported high energy products achieved in NdFeB and SmCo based hard/soft multilayers. The hybrid coercivity mechanism can be readily extended to single-phased permanent magnets with defects and other magnetic systems. (C) 2019 Chinese Society of Rare Earths. Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, energy products obtained by scientists in experiments are much smaller than the theoretical values, which has been studied by various analytical and numerical methods. The famous Stoner-Wohlfarth model (S-W model) is too simple to give the hysteresis loops whereas the intensively used variational method is too complicated to reveal the underlying mechanism in a simple form. The analytical model proposed in this paper maintains a balance between simplicity and precision, where the spins in the soft layer rotate fast and coherently with the applied field while those in the hard layer response to the applied field much slower but also coherent. An exchange coupling is provided to maintain the exchange spring which drags the spins in the hard layer to follow those in the soft layer. Similar to the more sophisticated model, the calculated hysteresis loops display three typical magnetic phases, i.e., the rigid composite magnet, the exchange spring and decoupled magnet, whereas the simple SW model can only give one single phase, i.e., the rigid composite one. In addition to the hysteresis loop, the energy product and the nucleation fields have been calculated and compared with those calculated by other methods, which justifies our model. Careful comparisons show that our calculations are in good agreement with the experimental results and other theoretical results, especially for the important coercivity value and the related mechanism.

The meta-analysis in this article took a cross-cultural perspective to explore whether there were any differences between the effects of cyber victimization and traditional victimization on the presence of depression and anxiety in children and adolescents and to examine the effects of moderators in explaining these differences/similarities. Fifty-six empirical studies (generating 148 independent samples) were included with a total sample size of 214,819 participants. The results indicated that the effects of cyber victimization and the subtypes of traditional victimization on anxiety were significantly different, and there was a marginally significant difference for depression. The moderating effects of country of origin were found to be significant for depression, with the mean effect size in North America being significantly higher than in China and Europe, which suggested that culture was an important factor. The moderating effects of age were also found to be significant for the relationships between traditional victimization and depression, traditional victimization and anxiety, cyber victimization and depression, and cyber victimization and anxiety. In addition, the effect size for cyber victimization and depression has increased in more recent publication years.

J	Han, WC; Huang, CW; Yang, JZ				Han, Wenchen; Huang, Changwei; Yang, Junzhong			Opinion clusters in a modified Hegselmann-Krause model with heterogeneous bounded confidences and stubbornness	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS			English	Article						Heterogeneous populations; Opinion clusters; The size of the largest cluster	CONSENSUS FORMATION; DYNAMICS; NETWORKS	In opinion dynamics with continuous opinion, bounded confidence is a critical parameter. Agents can interact with each other only when the opinion difference between them is less than the bounded confidence. Larger bounded confidence always leads to fewer opinion clusters. Stubbornness characterizing the insistence of an agent on her own opinion is thought to only affect the transition time. In this work, a modified Hegselmann-Krause model with heterogeneous population is investigated, where agents in different/same subpopulation have different/same bounded confidence and stubbornness. We find that, due to the interaction among subpopulations, increasing the stubbornness of agents in the subpopulation with the largest bounded confidence favors fewer opinion clusters and the expansion of the largest cluster. We also find that increasing the bounded confidence of a subpopulation leads to fewer clusters and a larger largest cluster provided that all the others have large bounded confidence. While one subpopulation is with a small bounded confidence, there exist an optimal bounded confidence of another subpopulation for the smallest number of opinion clusters and that for the largest size of the largest cluster.

However, identification of the causes responsible for vegetation changes remain challenging. Using Geographical Detector, a new spatial statistical approach, individual and interactive influences of natural factors on vegetation NDVI changes were quantified for the Sichuan province. The optimal characteristics of key natural factors that are beneficial to vegetation growth were determined. The vegetation cover in Sichuan for 2000 and 2015 is good overall; areas with upper-intermediate and high vegetation cover account for more than 88% of the total area. Regions with an NDVI higher than 0.4 are noticeably transformed; regions with upper intermediate vegetation cover (NDVI from 0.4 to 0.8) tend to decrease significantly, whereas regions with high vegetation cover (NDVI>0.8) tend to increase significantly. Spatiotemporal variation in vegetation cover is very significant. Regions with high vegetation cover are distributed in the northeast part of the Sichuan Basin and on the northwestern Sichuan Plateau, whereas regions with low vegetation cover are distributed in urban agglomerative regions in the central part of the Sichuan Basin. Soil types, elevation, and annual mean temperature can satisfactorily account for vegetation changes. Natural factors have an interactive influence on NDVI. The synergistic effect of natural factors is manifested as mutual enhancement and nonlinear enhancement, and the interaction of two natural factors strengthens the influence of each individual natural factor. Natural factors within a favourable value range or favourable landform factors serve to promote and intervene in vegetation changes, adapt to climatic changes, and buffer against the effects of vegetation changes.

But the availability of microsatellites especially from expressed sequences is currently very limited in this species and the genus Microhyla. A total of 17,339 potential microsatellites were identified in 15,385 unigenes which were generated by Illumina paired-end sequencing in M. fissipes. Within all microsatellites, AG/CT, AAG/CTT, and AAAG/CTTT are most prevalent motif in each repeat class. We randomly selected 61 unigenes with the microsatellite to design primers and do genetic analysis in the Sichuan basin population of M. fissipes. Of all, 35 primer pairs (57.38%) successfully amplificated in M. fissipes, of which 14 (40.00%) were polymorphism. The observed and expected heterozygosity in the test population ranged from 0.02 to 0.92 and from 0.02 to 0.62, respectively. High transferability rates were detected in M. butleri (37.14%), M. heymonsi (45.71%), M. pulchra (57.14%) and M. mixture (71.43%). These results indicate that the Illumina paired-end sequencing system is of great value for identifying massive numbers of genic microsatellites in M. fissipes with high-efficiency. Furthermore, the described polymorphic loci in this study should be useful for population genetic and conservation genetic studies in M. fissipes and other closely related species from this important genus Microhyla.

A Noetherian quasi-SG-Prufer domain is called a quasi-strongly Gorenstein Dedekind domain. Let F be a field and X be an indeterminate over F. We prove that every ideal of the ring F + X-2 F[X] is strongly Gorenstein projective. We also show that every ideal of the ring Z + 3Zi (respectively, Z + 2Zi) is strongly Gorenstein projective.

Here, we proposed a homogeneous turn-off mode fluorescent strategy to detect melamine by coupling the process of exonuclease III-assisted (Exo III) amplification with the strand displacement reaction (SDR)-driven assembly of DNA G-quadruplex structures. Melamine (M) could bind to the thymine (T) base through hydrogen bonding to form a T-M-T structure, which inhibits the subsequent nucleic acid amplification reaction and formation of the G-quadruplex structure. DNA strand (G1) served as both a recognition probe and a signal probe, thus greatly simplifying the experimental design and operation. Furthermore, to improve the detection sensitivity, an ingeniously designed segment of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA, P1-G2) that contained the G-quadruplex sequence (G2) and a partially hybridized signal trigger strand (P1) was added to the system. Following the SDR and Exo III-assisted amplification, G1-DNA and G2-DNA were released and the cyclic production of G-quadruplex structures was initiated. The generated DNA G-quadruplex bound to the NMM (a fluorescent dye, N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX), providing enhanced fluorescence signals. This allowed for the highly sensitive detection of melamine at concentrations as low as 25 fM. The proposed fluorescent detection method of melamine concentration displayed a good linear relationship ranging from 100 fM to 100 pM, which showed improved performance over that of the non-enzyme-assisted sensing system (limit of detection is 15 pM). Additionally, this method exhibited a high selectivity towards the target molecule, melamine, in comparison to other substances. Furthermore, the method was used for the assay of melamine in real milk samples and satisfactory experiment results were obtained. The novel strategy developed in this research may be considered as a potential route for highly sensitive, simple, selective and accurate assay of small molecules.

However, large-sized MP nanoparticles (NPs) with irregular morphologies are inevitably achieved via the solid-state reaction with high-temperature calcination, which lead to the reduced availability of the active sites. Here, a simple and straightforward strategy was developed to synthesize monodispersed, uniformly distributed, and small RhxP NPs decorated on phosphorus-doped nitride carbon (PNC) via the pyrolysis of rhodium(III) chloride, triphenylphosphine, and melamine (RhxP/PNC-m). The RhxP/PNC-m that served as a HER electrocatalyst displayed excellent performance with the overpotentials of 24 and 27 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) in basic and acidic solutions, respectively. This catalyst also showed good long-term stability in both media. The high-performance of RhxP/PNC-m should be attributed to the small, monodispersed, and highly distributed RhxP NPs on PNC support, which can supply abundant catalytically active sites for HER. The developed strategy for the synthesis of small RhxP NPs may offer new opportunities toward the electrochemical applications of other metal phosphides.

The crystal structure, morphology and size of the obtained samples were characterized via X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. The influences of Ti4+ doping concentration on the microstructures and photoluminescent (PL) properties of the as-synthesized crystals were also investigated comprehensively. The XRD results indicate that all the as-synthesized BaGe(1-x)TixF6:Mn4+ samples are single phase solid solution crystals, although the doping concentration of Ti4+ has a remarkable influence on the lattice parameters. The SEM results reveal that all the as-synthesized BaGe(1-x)TixF6:Mn4+ phosphor samples are microcrystals with a predominant rod-like morphology and lengths ranging from 1 to 8 mu m and widths ranging from 0.2 to 2.5 mu m. The PL spectra reveal that all the obtained crystals exhibit characteristic emission peaks of Mn4+ ion, and the intensity of the strongest red emission peak located at 636 nm distinctly fluctuated with x, showing the highest at x = 0.6. Under excitation of 467 nm blue light, all the obtained BaGe(1-x)TixF6:Mn4+ samples can emit a warm red color, with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of less than 4500 K. The temperature-dependent PL emission spectra show that the BaGe0.4Ti0.6F6:Mn4+ sample possesses outstanding thermal stability, which can retain 62.27% of its initial emission intensity (323 K) even at 423 K. Employing the synthesized BaGe0.4Ti0.6F6:Mn4+ sample as a red component, a high-performance WLED with a correlated color temperature (CCT) of 4343 K, a color rendering index (CRI) of 93.2 and a luminous efficiency of 100.2 lm W-1 was obtained. Our findings suggest that BaGe(1-x)TixF6:Mn4+ can be a promising candidate as the red phosphor used in warm WLEDs.

In twisted bilayer graphene nanoribbons (tBLGNRs), the interlayer coupling strengths are different for two ribbon edges due to the inhomogeneous bonding, which splits the edge states into two individuals in energy. The lower-energy state, localizing at the ribbon edge with the stronger interlayer coupling, is a good candidate to generate one-dimensional (1D) topological superconductivity in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman field, and s-wave superconductivity. Majorana zero modes (MZMs) are found to be localized at both ends of this edge. The topological invariants of the system are explored by evaluating the Berry phase for infinite-length ribbons and Majorana polarization for quasi-1D ribbons, giving the same topological phase diagram. More importantly, by adjusting interlayer dislocation and uniaxial strain of tBLGNRs across the critical values, the lower-energy edge changes and 1D topological superconductivity can "jump" from one ribbon edge to the other one. Finally, by applying a gate voltage bias between bilayers or changing the interlayer distance, a MZM can transfer along the ribbon edge. The tBLGNRs provide an alternative platform to study 1D topological superconductivity and MZMs.	[Wang, Zhen-Hua; Xu, Fuming; Wang, Bin] Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Adv Thin Films & Applicat, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen-Hua; Li, Lin; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Inst Quantum Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen-Hua; Li, Lin; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen-Hua] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100193, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Sichuan Normal Univ, Ctr Computat Sci, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Lu, Rong] Tsinghua Univ, Dept Phys, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Lu, Rong] Collaborat Innovat Ctr Quantum Matter, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Wang, Bin; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Peng Cheng Lab, Ctr Quantum Comp, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China	Wang, B (reprint author), Shenzhen Univ, Shenzhen Key Lab Adv Thin Films & Applicat, Coll Phys & Optoelect Engn, Shenzhen 518060, Peoples R China.; Wang, B (reprint author), Peng Cheng Lab, Ctr Quantum Comp, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China.	binwang@szu.edu.cn; chenwq@sustech.edu.cn	CHEN, Weiqiang/D-3058-2009; WANG, BIN/Q-9065-2017	CHEN, Weiqiang/0000-0001-6740-6628; WANG, BIN/0000-0003-0648-8775	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0300300]; National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11904234, 11774238, 11674151, 11604138, 11874234, 11574220]	The authors express their gratitude to Dong-Hui Xu for many helpful discussions.

A comprehensive understanding of the relationship between oxygen vacancies and magnetism is of great importance. In this work, we report an oxygen vacancy concentration dependence of magnetism in a single-phase multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO)-based system. The BiFeO3-DyFeO3 (BDFO) solid solution is synthesized with controlled oxygen vacancies and is characterized by X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and AC impedance spectroscopy. The magnetic properties, especially magnetic pole inversion, are found to be highly dependent on oxygen vacancy concentration. The oxygen vacancies generate a Weiss molecular field on the Dy3+ ions in the magnetic field range of 570-1000 Oe depending on the oxygen vacancy concentration, and result in a residual net magnetization by breaking the balance between the two nearly antiparallel spin lattices of Fe3+ ions. This work demonstrates an effective way to control oxygen vacancies and thereby the magnetic properties and sheds light on the relationship between oxygen vacancies and magnetism in BFO-based multiferroics.

But low DNA repair capacity and plasmids transformation efficiency severely delay development and application of genetic tools based on homologous recombination (HR). TargeTron is a gene editing technique dependent on the mobility of group II introns, rather than homologous recombination, which makes it very suitable for gene disruption of Clostridium. The application of TargeTron technology in solventogenic Clostridium is academically reported in 2007 and this tool has been introduced in various clostridia as it is easy to operate, time saving, and reliable. TargeTron has made great progress in solventogenic Clostridium in the aspects of acetone-butanol-ethanol (ABE) fermentation pathway modification, important functional genes identification, and xylose metabolic pathway analysis and reconstruction. In the review, 12 years' advances of TargeTron technology applicable in solventogenic Clostridium, including its principle, technical characteristics, application, and efforts to expand its capabilities, or to avoid potential drawbacks, are revisisted. Some other technologies as putative competitors or collaborators are also discussed. It is believed that TargeTron combined with CRISPR/Cas-assisted gene/base editing and gene-expression regulation system will make a better future for clostridial genetic modification.

J	Zheng, WB; Shu, HP; Tang, H; Zhang, HQ				Zheng, Wenbin; Shu, Hongping; Tang, Hong; Zhang, Haiqing			Spectra data classification with kernel extreme learning machine	CHEMOMETRICS AND INTELLIGENT LABORATORY SYSTEMS			English	Article						Spectra data; Chemometrics; Classification; Extreme learning machine; Kernel	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; TRANSFORM INFRARED-SPECTROSCOPY; NIR SPECTROSCOPY; GEOGRAPHIC ORIGIN; AGING TIME; DISCRIMINATION; IDENTIFICATION; ADULTERATION; VARIETIES; DIFFERENTIATION	One of the most important issues in chemometrics is how to design a robust classifier for spectra data with high classification accuracy. Extreme learning machine (ELM) has proved to be an effective method for numerous pattern recognition problems. However, the randomness of ELM's hidden layer nodes setting would give rise to the oscillation of the hidden layer output matrix, which may bring down the stability of this model. This paper proposes a framework for spectra data classification using the kernel extreme learning machine (KELM) that can circumvent the calculation of hidden layer outputs and encode it in a kernel matrix inherently. Moreover, KELM doesn't need to specify the hidden layer feature mapping function, and the number of hidden nodes doesn't need to be given, which may avoid an extensive mapping calculation. The proposed framework contains two stages: spectral preprocessing and dimensionality reduction, as well as classification implementation with KELM. The experimental results on four datasets reveal that the radial basis function (RBF) should be a priority candidate kernel function for this kind of applications, and the suggestion of parameter selection is also given experimentally. Furthermore, the classification accuracy of KELM is superior to ELM in most cases, and KELM is significantly faster than ELM when the number of the training samples is relatively small, which is a common case for spectra data in chemometrics. Therefore, KELM may be a promising method for rapid spectra data classification.

However, the commercialized application of Li-S batteries is still restricted by several problems, including the dissolution of polysulfides in electrolyte and low conductivity of sulfur. Herein, a three-dimensional conductive cross-linked all-carbon network as a host matrix of sulfur is rationally designed and constructed using biomass silkworm faeces derived porous carbon (SFPC), reduction graphene oxide (rGO) and carbon nanotubes (CNTs) via a one-pot heat treatment approach. Meanwhile, it is found that the amounts of rGO and CNTs added have a great influence on the electrochemical properties of electrode. The optimum contents of CNTs and GO were explored, which are both 5% (the as-prepared material denoted as 55-PGC@SFPC). The obtained 55-PGC@SFPC/S with high content sulfur of 70% as a cathode of Li-S batteries exhibits the initial discharge capacity of 1354 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, excellent rate capacity of 478 mAh g(-1) at 3 C, admirable long-term cycling stability with a high reversible capacity of 414 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles and low capacity decay rate of 0.035% per cycle. The designed three-dimensional network structure could lead to a quick diffusion of Li+/e(-) and a good impeding effect for polysulfides dissolution, which is beneficial for developing the advanced energy storage device of Li-S batteries.

The 99.58% removal of nitrate, 0.073 min(-1) of rate constant and 94.3% nitrogen selectivity were achieved in Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH system under the initial pH 2.5, 13.8 mmol/L of formic acid and 60 g/L of Zn-0.06%Ag dose at 60 min. The Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH system had the highest removal rate and nitrogen selectivity for nitrate reduction compared with the alone or two combinations of Zn-Ag bimetals, formic acid, and UV-A. Furthermore, the co-existence anions of HCO3- and CO32- showed a negative effect on nitrate reduction while SO42- had slightly promoted the reduction process. During the nitrate reduction by Zn-Ag/hv/HCOOH process, rapid reduction of NO3- to NO2- was primarily caused by Zn-Ag bimetal. Subsequently, the conversion of NO2- to N-2 was mainly owing to the produced CO2 center dot(-) by the reaction of formic acid and UV-A. The results suggested a novel strategy of chemical reduction combined with photoreduction for denitrification with high reaction kinetic as well as high nitrogen gas selectivity.

Different from some existing results with all known transition rates, GSPs are considered for coupled Markovian RDNNs, where each transition rate can be completely unknown or only its estimation is known, or each transition rate of some modes is completely unknown. To reflect more realistic behaviors, actuator failures are considered for coupled Markovian RDNNs, and a mode-dependent reliable control scheme is proposed. Then, a new Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional (LKF) is introduced, which fully utilizes the information on the slope of neuron activation functions. Based on the LKF, a synchronization criterion is established in the form of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Moreover, the mode-dependent reliable control gains are obtained. Finally, a numerical example is given to verify the effectiveness of the proposed results. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The search for exotic physical properties, such as magnetic and topological order, in 2D materials could enable the realization of novel quantum devices and is therefore at the forefront of materials science. Here, we report the discovery of twofold degenerate Weyl nodal lines in a 2D ferromagnetic material, a single-layer gadolinium-silver compound, based on combined angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and theoretical calculations. These Weyl nodal lines are symmetry protected and thus robust against external perturbations. The coexistence of magnetic and topological order in a 2D material is likely to inform ongoing efforts study the rich physics in 2D topological ferromagnets.

When the MnCO3-RGO composite is used as anode material, it delivers outstanding electrochemical performance: it exhibits a large capacity of 873 mAh g(-1) even after 400 cycles at a current rate of 1 C, which is over 55.6% higher than that of bare MnCO3 (561 mAh g(-1)); most importantly, the MnCO3-RGO composite demonstrates a superior high-rate performance and long-term stability with a very large capacity of 546 mAh g(-1) even after 1000 cycles at a very large current rate of 5 C. This terrific electrochemical performance of MnCO3-RGO composite is mainly ascribed to its unique architecture: the excellent mechanical flexibility of RGO sheets can stabilize the microstructure of MnCO3 and guarantee the long-term stability during charge/discharge even at large current rate; the high conductivity of RGO sheets can effectively accelerate the transfer of electrons. This work presents a facile and cost-effective synthesis strategy, which gives a guidance for the synthesis of the other transition metal oxides-RGO composite. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

J	Wang, C; Zhao, YH; Liu, Y				Wang Chuang; Zhao Yong-Hong; Liu Yong			First-principles calculations of magnetic and optical properties of Ga1-xCrxSb (x=0.25, 0.50, 0.75)	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						first-principles; Cr ion implantation; electronics structure; optical properties	HALF-METALLIC FERROMAGNETISM; GENERALIZED GRADIENT APPROXIMATION; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; BAND-STRUCTURE; 1ST PRINCIPLES; GASB; MAGNETOTRANSPORT; SPINTRONICS; TEMPERATURE; INAS	As the demand for electronic devices increases continually, the spintronic materials have played an important role in materials science and electronics. Spintronic devices have excellent properties such as non-volatility, low power consumption, and high integration compared with conventional semiconductor devices. In this paper, we investigate the electronic structure, magnetic and optical properties of the semiconductor GaSb doped with 3d transition metal Cr, based on first-principles calculations. The compounds are constructed by replacing some Ga atoms with Cr in zinc-blende GaSb semiconductor, where the concentrations of the Ga atoms replaced are 0, 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. We adopt the projected plane wave method and the electronic exchange correlation functional PBE in the generalized gradient approximation. Band gap is modified by Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) functional. We study the equilibrium lattice constants of Cr-doped GaSb in zinc-blende structure at different concentrations. The energy of nonmagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states at the equilibrium lattice constants are compared to identify the ground state. For Ga1-xCrxSb (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75), we find that the most stable state is ferromagnetic state. In the electronic structure of the ground state, the spin-up bands pass through the Fermi level while the spin-down bands each have a direct band gap. The Ga1-xCrxSb exhibit ferromagnetic half-metallic properties. The magnetic properties at different lattice constants under different concentrations are studied. Our analysis indicates that the Ga1-xCrxSb have integer Bohr magnetic moments of 3.0, 6.0, 9.0 mu(B) for x = 0.25, 0.50 and 0.75, respectively. We find that when the lattice changes fom -5% to 20%, the total magnetic moment for each of Ga1-xCrxSb still remains the integer Bohr magnetic moment, and the magnetic moment of the Cr increases with the lattice constant increasing. We also find that the ferromagnetisms of Ga1-xCrxSb have Curie temperatures above room temperature, estimated by mean-field method. The p-d electron hybridization occurs in Cr-3d orbital and Sb-5p orbital, and the electron state density distribution of Cr-3d is transferred, that is, the electron orbital hybridization makes the total electron state density of crystal material redistributed, which is the main reason why Ga1-xCrxSb (x = 0.25, 0.50, 0.75) present ferromagnetic half-metallic properties. Additionally, the Ga1-xCrxSb have good absorption ability in the infrared region, compatible with zinc-blende semiconductors such as GaSb, which makes Ga1-xCrxSb have promising potential applications in both spintronic devices and infrared optoelectronic devices.

The dielectric properties, hydrogen bonding, transport properties, energy distribution and local structure have been evaluated by classical molecular dynamics method. In the process of microwave energy distribution, the direct coupling of rotational motion, vibration and redirection is revealed. Microwave energy is converted into kinetic energy and interaction energy between two molecules. A mechanism for exploring the effects of microwaves on the non-thermal effects of brine systems over a longer simulation time and a wider microwave range is proposed. The increase in field intensity is usually accompanied by local damage to the water structure near the hydrated ions. More specifically, above the field threshold, the residence time of water molecules near the ions significantly decreases.

Surprisingly, the second-order quantum phase transition (QPT) is observed for the sub-Ohmic bath in the rotating-wave approximations. Moreover, first-order QPTs can also appear before the critical points. With the decrease of the bath exponents, these first-order QPTs disappear successively, while the second-order QPT remains robust. The second-order QPT is further confirmed by multi-coherent-state variational studies, while the first-order QPT is corroborated with the exact diagonalization in the truncated Hilbert space. Extension to the Ohmic bath is also performed, and many first-order QPTs appear successively in a wide coupling regime, in contrast to previous findings. The previous pictures for many physical phenomena for the spin-boson model in the rotating-wave approximation have to be modified at least at strong coupling.

Unification of multiple classes of explosive percolation	EPL			English	Article								Percolation, characterizing the emergence of large-scale connectivity from a great number of isolated nodes, can generate continuous, multiple discontinuous and discontinuous phase transitions, which correspond to different physical processes, respectively. In this paper, we found a percolation model which unifies all the three types of phase transitions with a continuously tunable parameter alpha. When decreasing alpha from 1 to 0, the type of phase transition transfers from continuous to multiple discontinuous, and finally the percolation process exhibits a single discontinuity lacking a supercritical region. By carefully examining the evolving characteristic of the clusters, it is verified that the transition value of alpha is between 0.75 and 0.7 for the phase transition from continuous to multiple discontinuous, and the distinctly different behaviors of the relative variance of the order parameter at alpha = 0.75 and alpha = 0.7 confirm the result. On the other hand, the transition value of alpha is 0.5 at which the type of phase transition changes from multiple discontinuous to discontinuous. These results may be helpful in understanding the physical mechanisms behind various percolation transition processes. Copyright (C) EPLA, 2019.

The obtained equilibrium structure parameters and ground state properties are in excellent agreement with the experimental and other theoretical results. The calculations of the phonon dispersion curve and the density of phonon states verify that the WC-TaN is dynamically stable. A full elastic tensor and anisotropies behavior of the WC-TaN is also evaluated and discussed in the wide pressure range. The results show that WC-TaN is elastic anisotropy and mechanically stable up to 100 GPa, and the compression along c-axis direction is more difficult than along a-axis. The obtained superior mechanical properties show that WC-TaN is a promising candidate structure to be one of the ultra-incompressible and hard materials. Finally, by using the quasi-harmonic approximation model, we predicted the thermodynamic properties of WC-TaN under pressure and temperature. The heat capacity C-V, Debye temperature theta, the thermal expansion alpha and the Gruneisen constant gamma are obtained successfully in the ranges of 0-100 GPa and 0-2000 K.

Skyrmion-based metallic racetrack memory has potential to replace traditional domain walls to store information as data bits, in which, however, skyrmions can drift from the direction of electron flow due to the Magnus force. In addition, skyrmion-edge effect at the end of the racetrack can cause the clogging of the skyrmions at the end of the racetrack. Here, we show that the clogging of skyrmion signals can be avoided by adding various kinds of notch at the end of the racetracks. On the other hand, by adding high-K materials (materials with high magnetic crystalline anisotropy) at the edges, the skyrmions can be confined in the center region of the metallic racetrack successfully. This design can overcome the problems of both clogging and annihilation according to our micromagnetic simulation. As a result, skyrmions can pass the right end of the racetrack efficiently at a very high speed (100-300 m/s), whereas the driving current is much smaller in comparison with other racetrack design. Besides, we study the influence of the uneven part at the joint of the high-K material and the CoPt racetrack on the skyrmionic motion. It is found that at the joint between the high-K material and the CoPt racetrack, the concave part basically does not affect the passage of skyrmion, but the convex part does when the length and width of the convex part reach a certain value. The results show that the design has high feasibility.

The study focused on the coupling of rhizosphere effect on microbial processes and changes in belowground carbon input caused by clonal integration. Sufficient clonal fragments of Phyllostachys bissetii were selected in-situ, consisting of a mother ramet and an offspring ramet. Shading treatment was performed for the offspring ramets. Rhizomes between two ramets were connected or severed. Carbon and nitrogen availabilities were assessed in the rhizosphere or bulk soil of shaded ramets, as well as nitrogen turnover and extracellular enzyme activities. The results showed that clonal integration increased the DOC level, microbial biomass nitrogen, enzymes activities and nitrogen nitrification rate in the rhizosphere of shaded ramet. Available nitrogen (dissolved organic nitrogen, ammonium or nitrate nitrogen) was decreased by rhizome connection. Significant effect of location and rhizome connection status and their interaction were observed. Shading treatment of severed ramet reducing the photosynthates flow to the soil led to similar rhizosphere process compared to bulk soil. Further, the disappearing rhizosphere effect on microbial processes of shaded ramet re-occurred due to the support of photosynthates translocated from unshaded one in a clonal fragment. The results suggest that recovered root exudates in the rhizosphere of shaded ramet by clonal integration stimulated a better adaption of clonal plant under heterogeneous light habitats.

An R-module M is said to be weak w-projective if Ext(R)(1) (M, N) = 0 for all N is an element of P-w(dagger), where Pt denotes the class of GV-torsionfree R-modules N with the property that Ext(R)(k) (M, N) = 0 for all w-projective R-modules M and for all integers k >= 1. In this paper, we define a domain R to be w-Matlis if the weak w-projective dimension of the R-module Q is <= 1. To characterize w-Matlis domains, we introduce the concept of w-Matlis cotorsion modules and study some basic properties of w-Matlis modules. Using these concepts, we show that R is a w-Matlis domain if and only if Ext(R)(k) (Q, D) = 0 for any P-w(dagger)-divisible R-module D and any integer k >= 1, if and only if every P-w(dagger) -divisible module is w-Matlis cotorsion, if and only if w.w-pd(R)Q/R <= 1.

Three key macroeconomic fundamentals, i.e., foreign exchange market, domestic economic development and total foreign trade volume in China are used to detect their functions as transmission channels between oil futures market and China stock market. Different from extant literature, our empirical results show that firstly oil futures market has significant impacts on China stock market through both a direct way and an indirect way by the macroeconomic channels. Secondly, there are significant long-term cointegration relationships between crude oil futures price and China stock market even if two structural breaks in this relationship are observed in March 2008 and December 2012, respectively. The long-term connections between them vary dramatically at different market regimes, and are enhanced greatly in recent years with the adjustments in refined oil pricing mechanism and exchange rate regime in China. Finally, we find that, among the three macroeconomic fundamentals, exchange rate market plays the most significant role in transforming the impacts of oil prices on China stock market particularly after the financial crisis.

The uniform dispersion of CNTs in matrix is guaranteed by this approach, which provides necessary conditions for studying the influence of CNTs on the motions of molecular chains. With increase of the CNTs loading, the storage modulus E ' of nanocomposites is correspondingly increased whereas tan delta is reduced compared with pure SBR. Furthermore, the glass transition is also moving towards higher temperature directly because the network structure is formed and endows stronger interaction between the fillers. Relaxation processes in polymers have been studied by dielectric spectroscopy. With the increase of CNTs loading in SBR matrix, the density of the packing network increases, and the free volume of the cavity would be smaller, which leads to the relaxation time of SBR/CNTs nanocomposites being longer than the pure SBR. It is found that the medium loading of CNTs are remarkably effective in improving the tensile strength of SBR.

These sanidic compounds, bearing eight peripheral chains, are mesomorphic and spontaneously self-assemble into columnar hexagonal mesophases (Col(hex)) over broad temperature ranges, as confirmed by polarized optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and small-angle X-ray scattering. Strong blue photoluminescence with absolute quantum yields up to 33 % were measured. These compounds also form blue-light emitting gels in various organic solvents. The fibrillar-like morphology of these gels, reminiscent of the columnar structure, and stabilized by efficient intermolecular interactions, was characterized by scanning electron microscopy. The charge carrier mobility of these pi-extended mesogens was measured by time-of-flight transient photocurrent technique in the Col(hex) mesophase, and showed good hole-transport performance with charge carrier mobility of 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1).

The focal shift takes place because of beam diffraction and Kerr nonlinearity effects. It is found that the actual focus can be moved to the debris target by initial beam defocusing only when the initial spatial coherence width is larger than a critical value. We derive the analytical formula of the modified focal length F-mod of the lens to move the actual focus of PCBs to the debris target. The F-mod increases as the initial spatial coherence width decreases. It is demonstrated that the detrimental diffraction and Kerr nonlinearity effects can be compensated effectively only when the F-mod is less than a maximum. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

A large number of fragment protons were observed at zero degree (along the beam direction) when the H-2(+) beam was passing through the monolayer graphene foil, which indicates that the electron of the H-2(+) molecular ions can be stripped easily even by the monolayer graphene foil. More trailing than leading protons were found in the energy spectrum, which means significant wake effect was observed in the monolayer graphene foil. The ratio of the numbers of trailing protons over leading protons first increased with the thickness for the much thinner graphene foils, and then decreased with the thickness for the much thicker graphite foils, which indicates that the bending effect of the wake field on the trailing proton varied with the foil thickness.

This paper proposed a novel and resultful semi-quantum secret sharing protocol, which is implemented using product states based on multi-level systems. In this scheme, the quantum capabilities of the receivers Bob and Charlie are limited, and the sender Alice does not have to access quantum memory. In addition, the security of the protocol is analyzed in detail from two aspects of Intercept-measure-resend and Entangle-measuring attacks initiated by internal malicious participants. More importantly, among the premise of proximate security of Ref. Li et al. (Quantum Inf. Process. 17, 285, 2018), our scheme reduces the number of particles used for eavesdropping detection and increases the amount of information carried by each particle.

Several item selection methods that proved to be more advantageous than the maximum Fisher information method are not practical for bifactor MCAT due to time-consuming computations resulting from high dimensionality. To make them applicable in bifactor MCAT, dimension reduction is applied to four item selection methods, which are the posterior-weighted Fisher D-optimality (PDO) and three non-Fisher information-based methods-posterior expected Kullback-Leibler information (PKL), continuous entropy (CE), and mutual information (MI). They were compared with the Bayesian D-optimality (BDO) method in terms of estimation precision. When both the general and group factors are the measurement objectives, BDO, PDO, CE, and MI perform equally well and better than PKL. When the group factors represent nuisance dimensions, MI and CE perform the best in estimating the general factor, followed by the BDO, PDO, and PKL. How the bifactor pattern and test length affect estimation accuracy was also discussed.

When the Kerr effect is strong enough, an Airy array beam may focus twice for the coherent combination, while an Airy array beam may not focus for the incoherent combination. These behaviors are quite different from those without Kerr effect. With and without Kerr effect, the self-healing of Airy array beams with main lobes blocked can be achieved. Furthermore, a better reconstruction for the incoherent combination case can be achieved than that for the coherent combination case. The propagation distance required for the reconstruction of Airy array beams with main lobes blocked decreases due to the Kerr effect. The reconstruction of an Airy array beam with main lobes blocked may complete before or after focusing, which depends on the intensity distribution and the coherence of the array beam and is independent of the Kerr effect.

With the low-order interaction of the rotating-wave terms, transparency induced by Autler-Townes splitting is obtained. When the high-order interaction of the counter-rotating-wave terms is considered, some sideband peaks show up and the probe field is amplified without population inversion. The stronger the coupling, the larger the amplification. The gain of probe photons comes mainly from the loss of the control field through a one-photon or two-photon process.

Unusual temperature-(T)-induced-shifts in the graphitic c-axis have also been reported in HOPG in conditions of theta misfit similar to 1 degrees (first-magic-angle). We report a novel investigation of HOPGs with theta( misfit) of 0.5 degrees, 0.8 degrees, 1.5 degrees, >> 1.5 degrees and of water-treated-turbostratic-graphite in the T-range from 298.15 to 673.15K. Presence of magic angles of rotations corresponding to the reported theta( misfit) values is demonstrated by repeated HRTEM and Moire pattern analyses of HOPG lamellae extracted from individual samples with scotch tape methods. Interestingly in our measurements the c-axis-shift is found to depend strongly on the misfit-angle, with the highest-values of 0.00428 and 0.00426 nm in proximity of the first-magic-angle (theta( misfit) similar to 0.8 degrees and similar to 0.5 degrees). Two diffraction-peaks present at similar to 23.5 degrees and similar to 48.5 degrees 2 theta (detector angle, in typical Bragg- Brentano configuration) for theta( misfit) similar to 1 degrees are also found to vanish for theta( misfit )>> 1.5 degrees. These findings imply existence of additional symmetry elements at the magic angle, which are not present in the standard space group notation used for structural characterization of graphite (P63/mmc).

The Fermi energy of graphene, which can be changed by applied electric fields affect the frequency of absorption peaks. By adjusting the phase difference between two interfering beams, the absorption intensity can be controlled. The simulated results indicate that the absorptivity can achieve nearly 100% change and the adjusting range of absorption frequency is up to 16 THz. With the flexible movement of four absorption peaks, the absorption bandwidth over 90% can be extended to 10 THz. What is more, this paper displays the application to photoswitch by phase modulation. In particular, the proposed absorbers are polarization-insensitive and almost omnidirectional. We hope that our results can provide substantial help for the potential applications in the future metamaterial devices.

Here we disclosed a new strategy for the fabrication of self-healable biomass aerogels, which is achieved by assembling the positively charged chitosan (CS) and negatively charged itaconic acid (IA) in aqueous solution, followed by a freeze-drying process. Due to relatively strong electrostatic interaction and unique morphology, the aerogel shows outstanding mechanical property even at very low apparent density. More importantly, it possesses ultrafast self-healing ability at room temperature. Once the aerogel is cut apart, it can repair both its structure integrity and mechanical performance within 30 s at room temperature via wetting one fractured surface. After self-healing, its compression strength is almost twice the value of the original one. In addition, the aerogel can be completely dissolved and reshaped, thus displaying excellent recyclability of the materials. Since both CS and IA are derived from natural resources, this work provides a promising solution to the fabrication of self-healable biomass aerogels with both high-performance and sustainability.

Accuracy and trustable forecasting of future energy consumption trends with nonlinear data sequences is very important for the decision makers of governments and energy companies. In this paper, a novel nonlinear grey Bernoulli model with fractional order accumulation, abbreviated as FANGBM(1,1) model, is proposed to forecast short-term renewable energy consumption of China during the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020). The new model is discussed in details with the fractional accumulated generating matrix and the Bernoulli equation. Further, the Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm is used to search optimal system parameters. Based on the updated real-world data sets from 2011 to 2015, the FANGBM(1,1) model is established to forecast the total renewable energy consumption, hydroelectricity consumption, wind consumption, solar consumption, and consumption of other renewable energies, respectively. The FANGBM(1,1) model presents high accuracy in all cases and is also proved to be efficient to deal with nonlinear sequences. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

We first apply the Galerkin method and compactness argument to prove the existence and uniqueness of weak solutions, which is slightly different from the deterministic fractional case with alpha is an element of (1/2, 1) and the real fractional case with alpha is an element of (0, 1). Consequently, we establish the existence and uniqueness of tempered pullback random attractors for the equations in a bounded domain. At last, we obtain the upper semicontinuity of random attractors when the intensity of noise approaches zero.

The crystal structure, morphology and luminescent properties of the as-synthesized phosphors were characterized through X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) and photoluminescence (PL), respectively. It is found that the sintering temperature has significant influences on the crystallinity, morphology and luminescent properties of the obtained Li1/3Sr1/3Eu1/3MoO4 phosphors. In the selected sintering temperature range (600-1000 degrees C), all the obtained Li1/3Sr1/3Eu1/3MoO4 phosphors possess tetragonal scheelite structure, the synthesized phosphors changed gradually from quasi-spherical to polyhedral particles with a size of 1.0-5.0 mu m. All the as-synthesized Li1/3Sr1/3Eu1/3MoO4 samples are typical red-emission phosphors, which can emit 591 nm and 615 nm red light under the excitation of 393 nm ultraviolet and 464 nm blue light, respectively. Moreover, the emission intensities of the phosphors firstly increase and then decrease with increasing sintering temperature, reaching the maximum at 800 degrees C. All the obtained Li1/3Sr1/3Eu1/3MoO4 phosphors displayed a pure red emission, which are promising red phosphors. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In the present investigation, we explored sandwiched composite nanosheets by encapsulating NiCo2O4 nanoparticles inside the pores of ZIF-67 crystals that were in situ grown on both surfaces of graphene oxide (GO). SEM and TEM observations confirmed the successful construction of the sophisticated architecture. For the designed electrode structure, the scaffold of GO provided a fast conductive highway for the encapsulated NiCo2O4 nanoparticles, while the porous and elastic framework of ZIF-67 together with the flexible GO guaranteed efficient accommodation to the volumetric change of NiCo2O4. Moreover, the highly porous composite nanosheets are suitable for electrolyte infiltration, with enhanced ionic transportation kinetics. Accordingly, the reversible capacity of NiCo2O4@ZIF-67/GO was high up to 1025 mA h g(-1) and 740 mA h g(-1) after 80 cycles at 0.5 and 2.0 A g(-1), respectively. At the current density of 4.0 and 8.0 A g(-1), the capacity was still retained at 500 and 320 mA h g(-1), respectively. Other analyses further manifested that the distinctive structure of NiCo2O4@ZIF-67/GO enhanced the charge transportation kinetics in comparison with the control sample of NiCo2O4@ZIF-67. Our strategy provided a new concept for developing high-performance electrode materials of lithium-ion batteries.

The main cost of cellulosic butanol fermentation is caused by cellulases that are required to saccharify lignocellulose, since solventogenic Clostridia cannot efficiently secrete cellulases. However, cellulolytic Clostridia can natively degrade lignocellulose and produce ethanol, acetate, butyrate and even butanol. Therefore, cellulolytic Clostridia offer an alternative to develop consolidated bioprocessing (CBP), which combines cellulase production, lignocellulose hydrolysis and co-fermentation of hexose/pentose into butanol in one step. This review focuses on CBP advances for butanol production of cellulolytic Clostridia and various synthetic biotechnologies that drive these advances. Moreover, the efforts to optimize the CBP-enabling cellulolytic Clostridia chassis are also discussed. These include the development of genetic tools, pentose metabolic engineering and the improvement of butanol tolerance. Designer cellulolytic Clostridia or consortium provide a promising approach and resource to accelerate future CBP for butanol production.

Herein, we discover that the pore structure of a supported catalyst significantly affects the products and efficiency of the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Three-dimensional (3D) porous carbon (PC) sheets with abundant micropores and macropores and mesopore-dominant activated carbon (AC) have been used to construct electrocatalysts with uniformly dispersed SnO2 nanoparticles. SnO2/PC exhibits efficient formate production from the electrochemical CO2RR with a high faradaic efficiency of 92% and partial current density of 29 mA cm(-2) at -0.86 V, ranking as a top-tier Sn-based catalyst. Importantly, systematic investigation and comparison with SnO2/AC show that the space-confinement effect of micropores enhances CO2RR selectivity towards formate by inhibiting proton transfer to active sites and thus suppressing the HER process, while the 3D sheet structure with abundant macropores provides mass and charge transport highways, making more active sites accessible for an effective CO2RR and thus a larger current density. These findings shed light on the design of efficient electrocatalysts via engineering pore structures for diverse applications.

Herein, a label-free and free separation fluorescence sensing platform was constructed for the determination of nucleic acid and prostate specific antigen (PSA) using CdTe QDs as the signal molecule. In our previous work, we surprisingly found that the CdTe QDs can selectively distinguish Ag+ and the C-Ag+-C complex, which was the basis of the sensor. On the basis of the selective cation exchange reaction (CER), combined with the signal amplification of the strand displacement reaction (SDR), this work was first applied for the sensitive analysis of DNA. There are two types of hairpin structures in this sensing system, including the recognition probe (HP) and Ag+, which formed the C-Ag+-C structure, and the hairpin structure formed by the helper DNA itself. In this work, target DNA can trigger the SDR that generates lots of HP-helper double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) and recycles the target DNA while releasing a large amount of Ag+, thus quenching the fluorescence signal of CdTe QDs to achieve the highly sensitive detection of DNA. In order to verify the versatility of this system using DNA as a bridge and aptamers as recognition probes, we extended the system to the detection of PSA. After examining its experimental performance, it was determined that this method displayed good analytical capability for DNA in the range of 10(-13)-10(-10) M and PSA in the range of 10(-13)-10(-10) g mL(-1) with low 25 fM and 30 fg mL(-1) limits of detection (LODs), respectively; high selectivity for both the target sequence and protein was shown. In addition, this platform was successfully used for the analysis of PSA in serum samples.

Here, we adopt a four-mode microring cavity including both second-order (chi((2))) and third-order (chi((3))) nonlinearities side coupled to two different waveguides to manipulate photon transport against dissipative effects. The results show that the incident signal photons can be amplified due to the optical parametric amplification (OPA) originated from chi((3)) nonlinearities. Owing to the coherent interference between cavity photons with different frequencies, the transmission spectra of the signal field are split into two amplified peaks. The transmission intensities are not always linearly reduced by increasing the dissipations but determined by the competition between the OPA and the dissipations. It means that we can utilize the OPA process to overcome the dissipative effects to manipulate photon transport and, thus, control the transmission intensities of the incident signal photon from T-c = 0 to T-c > 100%. This competition can also be used to convert the signal field to the idler field with amplified efficiencies.

Herein, inspired by many biomaterials that overcome this tradeoff by integrating soft and hard ingredients through elaborate structural designs, we report a facile latex-assembly method to fabricate ultra-tough, strong, and defect-tolerant elastomers. The elastomers are featured by a microscopic inverse opal-mimetic rigid skeleton of dynamically cross-linked chitosan and a continuous soft matrix of vulcanized natural rubber. Such structural design enables the load-bearing capability, sacrificial property, and self-healing ability of the skeleton, the stress redistribution and extensibility of the matrix, and the stiffness variation between hard and soft ingredients, thereby imparting the elastomers with outstanding mechanical strength and defect tolerance, as well as extremely high toughness of 122 KJ m(-2), which is even higher than that of the current state-of-the-art titanium alloys. Moreover, the elastomers show prominent humidity sensitivity due to the hydrophilic nature of the chitosan skeleton. Harnessing these advantages, we fabricate a walking robot triggered by humidity variation and shoes that are able to regulate temperature and humidity. The concept of designing a rigid sacrificial skeleton within a soft continuous matrix on the microscale is quite general, enabling the development of high-performance and intelligent materials for emerging applications.

In this paper, the critical properties of ionic liquids are combined with deep learning models (CP-DNN, CP-CNN, CP-RNN) to establish theoretical prediction models of CO2 solubility in ionic liquids. The predictive performance of these framworks is able to meet or exceed the predicted effects of the method based on thermodynamic models (PR,SRK) and machine learning method (XGBoost). For CP-RNN, the coefficient of determination (R-2) between experimental and predicted values is 0.988, CP-CNN is 0.999, and CP-DNN is 0.984. This research can avoid complex computational characterisation, it is to provide a theoretical method to further enrich and improve the data information analysis of the solubility of CO2 in ionic liquids.

However, numerous chemical activators including strong acids and bases were applied, leading to the entire process dangerous and hazardous. Eco-friendly, economic, and convenient synthesis of carbon materials with desired properties as supports for metal nanoparticle (NP) stabilization to boost performance is important but remains challenging. Here, we developed a facile and eco-friendly strategy to synthesize porous carbon nanosheets (PCNs) with ultrahigh specific surface area (2575.1 m(2)/g) via pyrolysis the mixture of potassium oxalate and glucose. The resultant PCNs can be used as ideal platform for in-situ distribution of small Rh NPs (Rh/PCNs) as efficient catalysts in hydrogen production from ammonia borane (AB) under ambient conditions. Specifically, Rh/PCNs displayed high activity for AB hydrolysis, with a turnover frequency (TOF) of 513.2 min(-1). Small and well-distributed Rh NPs on PCNs with large catalytically active surface atoms are contributed to the high catalytic property of Rh/PCNs for the reaction. Present study has demonstrated that the PCNs is a superior catalyst support for preparing a series of metal NPs in other catalytic applications beyond hydrolysis reaction.

Electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) is a promising route for artificial N-2-to-NH3 fixation with less energy consumption. However, an effective electrocatalyst, as a prerequisite of the NRR, is of significance. Here, we report that a spinel LiMn2O4 nanofiber acts as a noble-metal-free electrocatalyst for NH3 synthesis with excellent performance under ambient conditions. The electrocatalyst, which was tested in 0.1 M HCl, has an excellent Faradaic efficiency of 7.44% and a NH3 yield of 15.83 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.50 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, it also possesses excellent electrochemical and structure stability.

The analytical formulae of the self-focusing critical power. the Rayleigh range and the beam quality factor of H-G beams propagating in Kerr media are also derived. It is demonstrated that the ABCD law is valid if a new complex parameter is introduced, which presents a simple method to study the propagation of H-G beams through an optical system in Kerr media. It is shown that, as the beam order increases, the self-focusing critical power of H-G beams increase and H-G beams are less affected by the Kerr nonlinearity. Finally, it is found that the focus point of H-G beams never appears in self-focusing media, and the focal length is not suitable for characterizing the self-focusing effect of H-G beams.

Herein, a novel and label-free method was developed for Ag+ detection, which utilizes a florescence strategy combining DNA-templated copper nanoclusters (Cu NCs) with cation exchange reactions. The method is primarily based on the effective detection of an Ag+-triggered cation exchange reaction and the release of free Cu2+ from CuS nanoparticles (CuS NPs), while the probe T30 serves as an effective template for the formation of fluorescence-inducing Cu NCs. Under optimal conditions, this sensing system displays high sensitivity with a 50 nM limit of detection and a range from 0 - 100 mu M. In addition, the proposed method exhibits high selectivity and, therefore, was successfully applied to the analysis of real samples. Overall, these results demonstrate that our established method has advantages of design and operation simplicity, as well as cost-effectiveness.

In this paper, sulfamethazine (SMT) sorption onto six types of microplastics, including polyamide (PA), polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) was investigated by experimental and molecular dynamics simulation methods. The experimental results indicated that SMX sorption reached equilibrium within 16 h. The kinetics of SMT sorption by PA, PVC, PE, and PP could be fitted by pseudo first-order model, while SMT sorption by PA and PET could be described by pseudo second-order model. The partition coefficient K-d values were 38.7, 23.5, 21.0, 22.6, 18.6 and 15.1 L.kg(-1) for PA, PE, PS, PET, PVC and PP, respectively. SMT sorption onto microplastics decreased when pH and salinity increased. The molecular dynamics simulation results indicated that the main mechanisms involved in sorption are electrostatic and Van der Waals interaction.

Although the defensive biochemical mechanisms have been extensively studied in yeast and other filamentous fungi, little information is available about Aspergillus oryzae. We investigated the effect of two oxidant agents (menadione sodium bisulfite, MSB, and hydrogen peroxide, H2O2) on cellular growth and antioxidant enzyme induction in A. oryzae. Results indicated severe inhibition of biomass and conidia production when high concentration of oxidants was used. Transcriptomic analysis showed an up-regulated expression of genes involved in oxidoreduction, such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase. In addition, it was observed that oxidative stress stimuli enhanced the expression of Yap1 and Skn7 transcription factors. Further, metabolomic analysis showed that glutathione content was increased in the oxidative treatments when compared with the control. Moreover, the content of unsaturated fatty acid decreased with oxidative treatment accompanying with the down-regulated expression of genes involved in linoleic acid biosynthesis. This study provided a global transcriptome characterization of oxidative stress response in A. oryzae, and can offer multiple target genes for oxidative tolerance improvement via genetic engineering.

A variety of gem-difluoroalkenes, gem-difluorodienes, and alpha-trifluoro-methyl alkenes show high reactivity and selectivity for this ipso monocarboxylation. Under mild conditions, diverse important alpha-fluoroacrylic acids and alpha,alpha-difluorocarboxylates are obtained in good-to-high yields. Moreover, this operationally simple protocol features good functional group tolerance, is readily scalable, and the resulting products are readily converted into bioactive alpha-fluorinated carbonyl compounds, indicating potential application in biochemistry and drug discovery. Mechanistic studies reveal that fluorinated boronate esters might be vital intermediates in this transformation.

Herein, we demonstrate that Fe-NC materials could be efficient for electrochemical N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) using iron phthalocyanine (FePc) with a well-defined FeN4 configuration as a model catalyst. By uniformly loading FePc molecules on porous carbon, it exhibits a high electrocatalytic activity for NRR with a NH3 yield rate of 137.95 mu g h(-1) mg(Fepc)(-1) at a low potential of -0.3 V (vs RHE). Importantly, by making comparisons with phthalocyanine without the Fe center and performing control and poisoning experiments together with theoretical calculations, we identify the Fe center in FeN4 as the most active site for NRR among five possible sites in FePc and discover that the preferred route is the alternating pathway of N-2 on Fe. These results open up opportunities for further exploring metal-nitrogen-carbon materials for highly efficient electrochemical N-2 fixation and NH3 production.

Nevertheless, the implementation of the western development strategy has accelerated the preliminary construction of comprehensive transport network since 2000. Due to the large area and significant geographical heterogeneity, there is a growing need to understand the relationship between transportation and economic development based on the perspective of spatial difference. By using GIS-based raster analysis and Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) model, we investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of highway, railway and airport accessibility, respectively, and estimated the correlation and heterogeneity between transport accessibility and the level of economic development. Results revealed that: (1) Transport accessibility in the QTP improved by 53.38% in the past 15 years, which is specifically embodied in the improvement of both highway and railway. (2) Accessibility presented prominent differentiation in the space, increasing from west to east and reducing with the rise of elevation, specifically, the best accessibility area of the highway is below 4000m above sea level, while the area with an altitude of over 4000 m has the lowest aviation time cost. (3) In general, the long weighted average time cost to critical transport facilities posed significantly negative effect on county economic growth in QTP, more positively, the adverse effect gradually weakened over time. (4) Obvious heterogeneity exists at the influence of different transport accessibility factors on the level of economic development, reflecting both in the horizontal space and altitudinal belt. Therefore, region-specific policies should be addressed for the sustainable development of transport facilities as well as economy in the west mountain areas.

This comparative study of 43 children with cochlear implants between Czech and China was conducted through questionnaire survey and in-depth interview followed by field observation. Among a continuum of educational placement including regular class, resource room, deaf school, institution and home stay, research findings suggest participant children generally adapt to the placement based on three indicators: environmental conditions, interpersonal relationship and academic achievement. Statistically significant difference exists in overall school adjustment of children between the groups. Child characteristics, family related and placement related factors influence on both of educational placement and school adjustment. Educational support provided in regular school is inadequate. Reported by both groups that communication barrier and poor academic performance are main reasons for children's transition from regular class to deaf school.

J	Qiao, Z; Park, J; Koolen, JH				Qiao, Zhi; Park, Jongyook; Koolen, Jack H.			On 2-walk-regular graphs with a large intersection number c(2)	EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF COMBINATORICS			English	Article							CLASSIFICATION	For a connected amply regular graph with parameters (v, k, lambda, mu) satisfying lambda <= mu, it is known that its diameter is bounded by k. This was generalized by Terwilliger to (s, c, a, k)-graphs satisfying c >= max{a, 2}. It follows from Terwilliger that a connected amply regular graph with parameters (v, k, lambda, mu) satisfying mu > k/3 >= 1 and mu >= mu has diameter at most 7. In this paper we will classify the 2-walk-regular graphs with valency k > 3 and diameter at least 4 such that its intersection number c(2) satisfies c(2) > k/3. This result generalizes a result of Koolen and Park for distance-regular graphs. And we show that if such a 2-walk-regular graph is not distance-regular, then it is the incidence graph of a group divisible design with the dual property with parameters (2, m; k; 0, lambda(2)).

In order to explore the optimal intimacy and the essential influence factors, ZnCrOx combined with ZSM-5 are employed to prepare the composite catalysts with different distances between the two components by changing the mixing methods. An aromatic selectivity of 74% (with CO conversion to be 16%) is achieved by the composite catalyst when the intimacy is in the range of nanometer. A so-called 'iterative reactions' mechanism of intermediates over oxides is then proposed and studied: the intermediate chemical can undergo a hydrogenation reaction on oxide. So the shorter the intermediates stay on oxide, the more of chance for C - C coupling takes place on zeolite to form aromatics. Moreover, the aero-environments of reaction is found to impact on the extent of iterative reaction as well. Therefore, when the intimacy between the two components changes, the extent of iterative reactions vary, resulting in alteration of product distribution. This work provides new insight in understanding the mechanisms during the complex process of OX-ZEO composite catalysis and sheds light to the design of a high-yield catalyst for synthetization of aromatics from syngas.

The modified method uses the P-k/Pk-1 (k >= 1) discontinuous finite element combination for velocity and pressure in the interior of elements. Especially, the numerical traces v(hb) which are defined in the interface of the elements belong to the space C-0 (epsilon(h)), this change leads to less degree of freedom for the resultant linear system. The stability, priori error estimates and L-2 error estimates for velocity are proved in this paper. In addition, we prove that the modified method also yields globally divergence-free velocity approximations and has uniform error estimates with respect to the Reynolds number. Finally, numerical results illustrate the performance of the method, support the theoretical properties of the estimator and show the efficiency of the algorithm.

It is very suitable to handle the situation that there are various possible values in membership and nonmembership degrees to depict the true circumstance. The bidirectional project method of DHPFS calculates method considered not only the bidirectional projection magnitudes and the distance but also includes angle between objects evaluated. Therefore, this paper proposes a bidirectional project method of DHPFS to handle the multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problem under the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy environment. Through the measure between each alternative decision matrix and the positive and negative ideal alternative matrix, the ranking order all alternatives can be used to select the best alternative. Furthermore, a model for MADM has been given. Finally, a numerical example for performance assessment of new rural construction has been given to demonstrate the application of bidirectional project method of DHPFS, and we used the dual hesitant Pythagorean weighted Bonferroni mean to compare its reasonable and effectiveness.

The majority of studies by Chinese researchers have been focused on the carrying capacity and land development intensity, and less attention has been paid to the ecological security pattern of the landscape in Mianzhu in the transitional zone between the Chengdu Plain region and the Longmen Mountains, western China. However, land resources are undergoing significant changes resulting from land use associated with rapid economic development and demographic growth. In this study, we constructed a minimum cumulative resistance model in Mianzhu in the transitional zone, and the land space was divided into optimized development areas, key development areas, restricted development areas, and prohibited development areas according to the landscape ecological security pattern based on the model surface. These land use types covered 7218.39ha, 17,974.75ha, 21,545.39ha, and 77,791.46ha, respectively. We also examined land use changes over the last 20years and quantitatively analyzed the relationships between land use changes and geographic factors based on remote sensing and geographic information system. The information obtained from this research ultimately impacts future policies and plans regarding land resources and can be used to promote the sustainable use of land resources in the region.

Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy investigations suggest that the electrical conductivities of densified electrolytes are closely related to sintering temperature and grain size, and GDC900-750 exhibits the highest total electrical conductivity of 3.640 S m(-1) at 700 degrees C in air. Fitting calculation indicates partial grain-size dependence of oxygen vacancy association enthalpy and grain-size independence of oxygen ion migration enthalpy. Grain boundary maturity influences on grain boundary conductivity to some extent, and younger grain boundary endues the densified electrolytes with higher grain boundary conductivity.

All ceramics can be well-sintered at 1200 degrees C. The addition of La3+ and Nb5+ reduces the grain size and improve the dielectric breakdown strength of the ceramics; moreover, after the introduction of La3+ and Nb5+, the remanent polarization of the ceramics is significantly reduced, while the maximum polarization remains the same large value as that of the ceramic without the doping of La3+ and Nb5+. As a result, high energy storage density and discharge efficiency are achieved at x/y = 0.07/0.02, giving the large storage density of 1.83 J/cm(3) and high discharging efficiency of 70%. The present work presents a feasible strategy to develop energy storage materials based on perovskite ferroelectrics by the partial substitutions in the A and B sites.

However, it remains to be a challenge in manufacturing large-scale and uniform substrates. Here, a novel fabrication method, surface plasmon lithography (SPL) technology, is developed to fabricate large-scale and uniform diamond silver nanoparticle (DSN) arrays with inter-nanoparticle gap of 30 nm. Experimentally, the fabricated SERS substrates are uniform within a large scale of 10 mm(2). Besides, the enhancement factor (EF) larger than 10(7) is obtained via detecting Rhodamine 6G molecules, deriving from the enhanced electromagnetic (EM) field in the form of catenary optical fields between neighboring DSNs. Our work demonstrates that SPL technology is a straightforward approach for easily fabricating gap-controllable SERS substrates with large area, high uniformity and high sensitivity.

Monitoring the in-situ growth of CdTe QDs is shown to be a novel route to label-free and visual detect butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), an important enzyme in human bodies. BChE can catalyze butyrylcholine (BTCh) to produce thiocholine (TCh), which is an excellent thio-ligand during CdTe QDs growths. Therefore, BChE can activate the thio-ligand via enzymolysis thus trigger the growth of luminescent QDs. As the BChE concentration was proportional to the fluorescence intensity of the QDs, the activity of BChE was detected accordingly. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the limit of detection (LOD) of BChE was found to be 0.96 U L-1. The relative standard deviation (RSD) (n = 7) was 1.8%. What's more, parathion, one of the organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), which inhibits the activity of BChE, was used to prevent the generation of thiocholine and therefore inhibits the growth of QDs. As a result, this sensing system can also present a turn off mode for the parathion detection with highly sensitivity (LOD = 0.38 ng mL(-1)). Furthermore, visual detection was realized for BChE and parathion in this strategy, 40 U L-1 of BChE and 2 ng mL(-1) of parathion can be discriminated from the blank solution with the naked eye, respectively.

However, the technology of mineral resources development in minority areas is relatively backward and the utilization rate isn't high. Unreasonable exploitation for mineral resources has caused tremendous damage of mining environment, which restricts the sustainable, healthy and stable development of mining areas. Therefore, how to construct the ecological industrial chain of mineral resources in minority areas has become an important issue of mining sustainable development. In this paper, a SD model with the characteristic of minority areas is established by constructing the dynamical system flowchart that takes mineral resources-environment-economy-society (MEES system) as the main research object based on system dynamics simulation, combination determining weights, and fuzzy sets, etc. In addition, taking Tibetan minority areas for an example, this paper predicts the tendency of the MEES system in the region. Meanwhile, this paper designs four different development modes to provide the operable choice and reference for exploiting the mineral resources in minority areas.

The truncation error and stability of the scheme are discussed in detail. The existence of the numerical solution is shown by the Brouwer fixed point theorem. For improving the calculating efficiency, a three-level linearized difference scheme is also proposed and analyzed. Both schemes are subsequently extended to the nonlinear coupled equations, and some similar results are given and proved. Several numerical experiments are included to verify the accuracy and efficiency of the two types of schemes, and comparison with the related work is presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Herein, a series of novel indirect double Z-scheme BiOBr-GO-polyaniline systems were rationally designed and successfully synthesized. Their physical and photochemical properties were characterized by means of scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscope (TEM), energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS), X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), X-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS), UV-vis absorption spectra (UV-Vis DRS), transient photocurrent and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results evidenced that the presence of GO and polyaniline obviously expanded the spectral response range and improved quantum yield. As expected, BiOBr-GO-polyaniline presented excellent photocatalytic activity and outstanding photostability in degradation of the colorless organic compound (phenol). Its highest degradation conversion of phenol was up to 89%, much higher than that of polyaniline (5%), BiOBr (34%), BiOBr-GO (43%) and BiOBr-polyaniline (55%). It is still active in the subsequent runs of photocatalytic degradation experiments of phenol, preserving 90% of the initial degradation conversion even after the fifth run. Moreover, based on experimental data analysis, sample characterization and band theory, the charge carriers migration process over BiOBr-GO-polyaniline system was proposed. In this system, the establishment of double Z-scheme ensured that high carrier separation and strong redox ability were simultaneously achieved.

In this work, (1 - x)(K0.5Na0.5)NbO3 - x[NaSbO3 + Bi-0.5(Na0.8K0.2)(0.5)(Zr0.5Hf0.5)O-3] lead-free ceramics with R-O-T ferroelectric phase coexistence were developed and the relationship between the phase structure and piezoelectricity was investigated in detail. As x increases, the transition temperature of the rhombohedral and orthorhombic phases (TR-O) increases, while the orthorhombic-tetragonal phase transition temperature (TO-T) decreases. When 0.04 <= x <= 0.05, three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T) coexist near room temperature in the ceramics. Due to the highly consistent orientation of the ferroelectric dipole and the free energy flattening and a low energy barrier induced by the coexistence of three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T), excellent piezoelectric performances of d(33) = 452 pC N-1, k(p) = 63% and epsilon(r) = 4414 are achieved at x = 0.04. Our study suggests that compared with two ferroelectric phase boundaries (R-O and O-T), the coexistence of the three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T) can effectively enhance the piezoelectric properties of (K0.5Na0.5)NbO3-based ceramics.

Faced with massive emerging technologies which are the component of the technology pool, how to identify the commercial potential of emerging technologies in theory and practice is an important problem. The scientific approach to the selection of these emerging technologies is one of the main objectives of the research. In this paper, we extend Muirhead mean (MM) operator and dual MM (DMM) operator to process the Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (PFNs) and then to solve the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) problems. Firstly, we develop some Pythagorean fuzzy Muirhead mean operators by extending MM and DMM operators to Pythagorean fuzzy information. Then, we prove some properties and discuss some special cases with respect to the parameter vector. Moreover, we present some new methods to deal with MADM problems with the PFNs based on the proposed MM and DMM operators. Finally, we verify the validity and reliability of our methods by using an application example for potential evaluation of emerging technology commercialization, and analyze the advantages of our methods by comparing with other existing methods.

Herein, we report a three-dimensional (3D) trimetallic nickel-iron-cobalt phosphide with a hierarchical nanoarray structure grown in situ on carbon cloth via a combined method of two-step hydrothermal reaction and following low-temperature phosphating using a carbon cloth as a conductive substrate. The synthesized NiFeP/CoP/CC exhibits excellent oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalytic performance, giving small overpotentials of 250 mV, 270 mV and 320 mV at current densities of 20 mA cm(-2), 50 mA cm(-2) and 200 mA cm(-2) in alkaline electrolyte, respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). In addition, the catalytic activity of the material remains stable for at least 50 h, and the turnover frequency (TOF) is 0.466 mol 02 s(-1) at an over potential of 300 mV. These properties of the material are comparable to those of the noble metal catalyst RuO2/CC, which may be ascribed to the hierarchical microstructure, good conductivity and desirable synergistic effect among metal ions.

We calculated the adsorption structure of ornidaozle on the anatase TiO2 surface, optimal adsorption sites, adsorption energy, density of states, electronic density and Milliken atomic charge under different conditions. The results show that when the N(3) atom on the imidazole ring is adsorbed on the Ti(5) atom, the largest adsorption energy and the most stable adsorption configuration could be achieved. According to the analysis of the adsorption configuration, we found that the stability of C(2)-N(3) bond showed a weakening trend. The adsorption wavelengths of the electronic transition between the valence band and conduction band of ornidazole on the TiO2 surface were in the visible light wavelengths range, showing that the TiO2 crystal plane can effectively make use of visible light under different conditions. We speculate the possibility of ornidazole degradation on the surface of TiO2 and found that the reactive site is the C-N bond on the imidazole ring. These discoveries explain the photocatalytic degradation of ornidazole by TiO2 and reveal the microscopic nature of catalytic degradation.

The proposed antenna exhibits an impedance bandwidth of 132% (4.28 to 21 GHz) with a size of $0.199\lambda _L \times 0.256\lambda _L \times 0.092\lambda _L$0.199 lambda Lx0.256 lambda Lx0.092 lambda L (where $\lambda _L$lambda L is the wavelength at 4.28 GHz). By using a U-shaped slot and stepped arms on the upper patch, as well as a tilt-folded patch feed, four resonances are produced and then wide bandwidth is achieved. By introducing a shorting wall standing between the fish-shaped patch and the ground plane, the antenna size is reduced. The simulation and measurement results show that the antenna provides excellent performance in different bands, meaning that acceptable gain and stable radiation patterns are obtained simultaneously.

Here, it is demonstrated that boron phosphide nanoparticles perform highly efficiently as a nonmetal electrocatalyst toward electrochemical reduction of CO2 to CH3OH with high selectivity. In 0.1 m KHCO3, this catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 92.0% for CH3OH at -0.5 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density functional theory calculations reveal that B and P synergistically promote the binding and activation of CO2, and the rate-determining step for the CO2 reduction reaction is dominated by *CO + *OH to *CO + *H2O process with free energy change of 1.36 eV. In addition, CO and CH2O products are difficultly generated on BP (111) surface, which is responsible for the high activity and selectivity of the CO2-to-CH3OH conversion process.

Visual assays have direct and effective characteristics; however, they have poor accuracy. We intended to improve the analytical performance of our previous work and simplify the experimental operation while maintaining the advantages of simple operation and low cost. Herein, we describe the development of a visual, chemical vapor generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry (CVG-AFS) and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) three-mode method for the analysis of nucleic acids via CdTe quantum dot (QD)-assisted selective cation exchange reaction and enzyme-free strand displacement amplification. This work mainly utilized the ability of CdTe QDs to selectively differentiate free Hg2+ from the T-Hg2+-T complex in addition to the simple selective membrane filtration separation of Cd2+ from CdTe QDs to improve the performance of label-free bioassay methods. Due to the superior optical features of CdTe QDs, they can not only be used as a signal molecule for atomic spectroscopy, but also for direct use in visual readings. Under optimal experimental conditions, the developed strategy displayed a wide linear range along with limits of detection (LODs) of 10 fM and 3 fM (2 fM) in the linear concentration ranges of 10 fM-100 pM and 10 fM-1 nM with the naked eye and CVG-AFS (ICP-MS) assays, respectively. This method also exhibited excellent DNA sequence specificity. This assay had advantageous characteristics such as an easy operation, simple design, high sensitivity, and diversified signal readout manner, which demonstrate its great potential in medical diagnosis applications.

Biomaterials with the ability of skewing macrophage phenotype have attracted widespread attention in the field of tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to transform macrophage phenotype by a three-step process; anodizing, drug loading and coating with polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films. Interleukin (IL)-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was loaded into titania nanotubes (TNTs) on the titanium surface. Subsequently, sodium alginate (ALG) and chitosan (CS) were alternately assembled onto IL-4-loaded TNTs and cross-linked with genipin/calcium chloride, finally forming cross-linked PEM films. The IL-4 release profile and cellular immune response of the modified surface was investigated. In the simulated biological solution, only 20% of IL-4 were detected in the first 3 days, with a sustained release of approximately 5 ng over 10 days. The results of gene expression and protein secretion in macrophages indicated that IL-4-loaded PEM films significantly attenuated the inflammatory activity of macrophages at the later stage through down-regulating the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory markers. In summary, IL-4 was controlled released from the cross-linked PEM films deposited on the nanotubes, leading to the temporal conversion of macrophage phenotype. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Compared to the parent compound KTP (3.52 eV), both sulfates exhibited a sharply enlarged band gap, i.e. 4.41 eV for RbSnFSO4 and 4.75 eV for RbSbF2SO4, due to the introduction of F- and the displacement of Ti4+ cations. Laser damage threshold (LDT) measurements verified the experimental trends. RbSnFSO4 crystallizes in the centrosymmetric (CS) monoclinic space group P2(1)/m (no. 11), and RbSbF2SO4 crystallizes in the orthorhombic crystal system with the noncentrosymmetric (NCS) polar space group Pna2(1) (no. 33). Second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements manifest that RbSbF2SO4 is phase-matchable with the SHG response being 0.96 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Both fluoride sulfates reported herein are promising short-wave ultraviolet optical materials.

Therefore, we aimed to examine the effect of fitness on acute exercise-induced changes in executive function from neural mechanism approach. Twenty-four female college students were assigned to high-fitness or low-fitness groups based on their cardiovascular fitness level, and then underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while performing N-back tasks before and after 30 min of acute exercise. The behavioral results revealed significant interaction effects of group by time in the 0-back and 1-back tasks, but not in the 2-back task. The accuracy was significantly higher in the highfitness group than in the low-fitness group before exercise in the 1-back and 2-back tasks. At the neural level, significant interaction effects of group by time were observed in all tasks. The 0-back and 1-back tasks activated the right cerebellum while the 2-back task activated subcortical regions. Our findings suggest that fitness moderates the effect of aerobic exercise on cognitive function, and provide the first neural evidence to support the influence of fitness on exercise-induced cognitive performance.

A new alternating projection-based prediction-correction method for structured variational inequalities	OPTIMIZATION METHODS & SOFTWARE			English	Article						Structured variational inequalities; alternating projection; prediction-correction method; Armijo linesearch; global convergence; continuous mappings	CONVEX MINIMIZATION; SPLITTING ALGORITHM; DIRECTIONS METHOD; LEAST-SQUARES; DECOMPOSITION	Recently, some proximal-based alternating direction methods and alternating projection-based prediction-correction methods were proposed to solve the structured variational inequalities in Euclidean space . We note that the proximal-based alternating direction methods need to solve its subproblems exactly. However, the subproblems of the proximal-based alternating direction methods are too difficult to be solved exactly in many practical applications. We also note that the existing alternating projection based prediction-correction methods just can cope with the case that the underlying mappings are Lipschitz continuous. However, it could be difficult to verify their Lipschitz continuity condition, provided that the available information is only the mapping values. In this paper, we present a new alternating projection-based prediction-correction method for solving the structured variational inequalities, where the underlying mappings are continuous. In each iteration, we first employ a new Armijo linesearch to derive the predictors, and then update the next iterate via some minor computations. Under some mild assumptions, we establish the global convergence theorem of the proposed method. Preliminary numerical results are also reported to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.	[Tu, K.; Zhang, H. B.] Beijing Univ Technol, Coll Appl Sci, Beijing, Peoples R China; [Xia, F.

A prospective study design was conducted. Patients completed the survey approximately 1month and 1 year after surgery. A hierarchical linear model was used to examine the linear and the quadratic relationships between PTG and QoL. The interaction term of PTG and depression was included in the model to explore the moderating effect of depression. A quadratic relationship was found between PTG and QoL in the patients who had significant depressive symptoms. A linear relationship between PTG and QoL was found in the patients without significant depressive symptoms. In conclusion, PTG improved the patients' quality of life to some extent. The relationship between PTG and QoL in LGG patients depends on the level of depression.

Secondary school students (n = 390, Mage = 15) responded to a survey form measuring psychological constructs pertaining to the research purpose. A series of multiple regression analysis showed that autonomy-supportive teaching and mindfulness positively predicted need satisfaction and negatively predicted need frustration. In addition, the associations between autonomy-supportive teaching and need satisfaction/frustration were moderated by mindfulness. Students higher in mindfulness were more likely to feel need satisfaction and less likely to experience need frustration, even in a low autonomy-supportive teaching environment. These results speak to the relevance of creating autonomy-supportive teaching environments and highlight mindfulness as a potential pathway to basic psychological need satisfaction in educational settings.

However, the immobilization of large magnetic particles on a carbon matrix greatly decreases the available sites for adsorption, resulting in a low adsorption capacity. The synthesis of magnetic carbon materials as adsorbents for dye adsorption with high adsorption capacity remains challenging. Herein, porous carbon (PC) was firstly synthesized through the calcination of macroporous acrylic type cation exchange resin. The as-prepared PC was applied as a matrix to deposit nano-sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles (MPC) via a facile one-pot solvothermal strategy. The nano-sized Fe3O4 nanoparticles (5.19 nm in diameter) are uniformly distributed on the PC surface. The MPC possesses an exceptional performance for methylene blue removal (q(e) = 214.4 mg g(-1)) at room temperature, outperforming most previous magnetic carbon adsorbents. The large surface area of the MPC originated from the combined advantages of PC and nano-sized Fe3O4 must be ascribed to the high performance of MPC composite toward methylene blue adsorption.

Based on density functional theory, exchange-correlation functionals which adequately account for non-covalent interactions, such as M06-2X and wB97XD, should significantly improve the accuracy of charge transport rate calculations for large systems with non-covalent interactions. In this work, the B3LYP hybrid functional, the variant hybrid functional M06-2X, and the long-range-corrected wB97XD functional were used to perform geometry optimizations and charge transport rate calculations on 11 variants of tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m]coronene, including tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m]coronene itself and its tetrasubstituted and octa-substituted derivatives. Our results indicate that the molecular geometries of these benzocoronene semiconductors are large quasi-planar conjugated pi systems, and the incorporation of different substituents significantly affects their frontier molecular orbitals. The hole carrier mobility (mu(+)) and electron carrier mobility (mu(-)) of the methoxy-substituted derivatives (TBC(OCH3)(4) and TBC(OCH3)(8)) were relatively low. The results of the tetrabenzo[a,d,j,m] coronene molecules studied were consistent with using the aforementioned M06-2X, wB97XD, and B3LYP methods. We found that the octa-substituted derivatives (TBCF8, TBCCI8, TBC(CH3)(8), and TBC(CN)(8)) could be used as p-type organic semiconductor materials.

But these methods require a number of train samples in each class to construct the dictionary. On the condition of undersampled train samples, their performance decreases dramatically. A novel method is proposed in this paper to address undersampled face recognition problem. Firstly, virtual face images are generated by principal component analysis and mirror transform. Secondly, the test sample is collaboratively represented by the augmented train samples and is recognized by classifier based on representation. A number of face recognition experiments on three benchmark face database show that the recognition accuracy of our method is greater than that of a similar method, while time efficiency of our method is competitive to similar method.

Accordingly, such CP materials and their further modification and improvement to achieve enhanced CP performance for promising applications in modern electronics, sensors, energy storage, and multifunctional devices have attracted extensive attention. In this Review, a general overview of the recent advances in CP materials is provided, ranging from their various categories, physical mechanisms, and modulation methods to promising applications. First, various classes of CP materials are categorized in terms of their structures and dielectric properties. Subsequently, this Review provides an insight into the CP mechanisms in views of barrier layer capacitance, defect-dipole cluster, and polaronic effect. Moreover, the strategies and prototypical works are introduced in some aspects, including the manipulation of CP properties by doping, percolative capacitors, and the methods employed to enhance the dielectric behaviors in CP materials with different forms. The authors then discuss a wide range of applications based on CP materials, such as modern electronics and energy storage. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for further investigation of CP materials are highlighted in the summary and future perspectives.

It was introduced in 1972, in the same paper where the first and second Zagreb indices were introduced to study the structure-dependency of total pi-electron energy. But this topological index had not received further attention until 2015. Very recently, Furtula and Gutman [B. Furula, I. Gutman, A forgotten topological index, J. Math. Chem. 53(4) (2015) 1184-1190] reinvestigated the index and named it the "forgotten topological index" or "F-index". There they presented some basic properties of this index and showed that this index can significantly enhance the physico-chemical applicability of the first Zagreb index. In this paper, we study the F-index of bipartite graphs of order n with diameter d and obtain sharp upper bounds for it. As a consequence, bipartite graphs with the largest, second-largest and smallest F-index are characterized.

The existing local conditional-entropies have both the second-order feature and application limitation. By improvements of hierarchical granulation, this paper establishes double-granule conditional-entropies based on three-level granular structures (i.e., micro-bottom, meso-middle, macro-top ), and then investigates the relevant properties. In terms of the decision table and its decision classification, double-granule conditional-entropies are proposed at micro-bottom by the dual condition-granule system. By virtue of successive granular summation integrations, they hierarchically evolve to meso-middle and macro-top, to respectively have part and complete condition-granulations. Then, the new measures acquire their number distribution, calculation algorithm, three bounds, and granulation non-monotonicity at three corresponding levels. Finally, the hierarchical constructions and achieved properties are effectively verified by decision table examples and data set experiments. Double-granule conditional-entropies carry the second-order characteristic and hierarchical granulation to deepen both the classical entropy system and local conditional-entropies, and thus they become novel uncertainty measures for information processing and knowledge reasoning.

By manipulating many degrees of the incident optical wavefront, the latest optical wavefront engineering (WFE) technology compensates the wavefront distortions caused by the scattering media and thus is toward breaking this physical limit, bringing bright perspective to many applications deep inside tissue, e.g., high resolution functional/molecular imaging, optical excitation (optogenetics) and optical tweezers. However, inside the dynamic turbid media such as the biological tissue, the wavefront distortion is a fast and continuously changing process whose decorrelation rate is on timescales from milliseconds (ms) to microseconds (mu s), or even faster. This requires that the WFE technology should be capable of beating this rapid process. In this review, we discuss the major challenges faced by the WFE technology due to the fast decorrelation of dynamic turbid media such as living tissue when achieving light focusing/imaging and summarize the research progress achieved to date to overcome these challenges.

We introduce an S-version of F-Mittag-Leffler modules, called F-s-Mittag-Leffler modules, and define the projective dimension with respect to these modules. We give some characterizations of F-s-Mittag-Leffler modules, investigate the relationships between F-Mittag-Leffler modules and F-s-Mittag-Leffler modules, and use these relations to describe noetherian rings and coherent rings, such as R is noetherian if and only if R-s is noetherian and every F-s-Mittag-Leffler module is F-Mittag-Leffler. Besides, we also investigate the M-Fs-global dimension of R, and prove that R-s is noetherian if and only if its M-Fs-global dimension is zero; R-s is coherent if and only if its M-Fs-global dimension is at most one.

Coercivity mechanisms in nanostructured permanent magnets	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Review						coercivity mechanism; permanent nanomagnets; self-pinning	FE-B; MELT-SPUN; NUCLEATION FIELD; HYSTERESIS LOOPS; MICROMAGNETIC ANALYSIS; REVERSAL MECHANISM; MAGNETIZATION REVERSAL; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; CRITICAL THICKNESS; PR-FE	Coercivity mechanism in permanent magnets has been debated for many years. In this paper, various models of the coercivity mechanism are classified and re-examined by the comparison and contrast. Coherent rotation and curling models can reveal the underlying reversal mechanism clearly based on isolated grains with elliptic shapes. By contrast, the numerical methods consider inter-grain interactions while simulating the evolution of the spins and hysteresis loops with complicated shapes. However, an exact simulation of magnetic reversal in permanent nanomagnets requires many meshes to mimic the thin domain wall well. Nucleation and pinning are the two main coercivity mechanisms in permanent magnets. The former signifies the beginning of the magnetic reversal, whilst the latter completes it. Recently, it is proposed that the large difference between the intrinsic magnetic properties of the nucleation centers and those of the main phase can result in a large pinning field (self-pinning), which has the attributes of both traditional nucleation and pinning. Such a pinning explains the experimental data of permanent magnets very well, including the enhancement of the coercivity by the grain boundary pinning.	[Zhao, G. P.; Zhao, L.; Shen, L.

Herein, a multifunctional conductive nanohybrid, which acts as a sulfur host, is rationally constructed by inserting/intertwining carbon nanotubes (CNTs) onto Co-embedded N-doped porous dual carbon polyhedrons derived from a resorcinol-formaldehyde (RF) polymer layer enwrapping ZIF-67 metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) (Co, N-C@RFC/CNTs). The porous carbon polyhedrons can accommodate a high amount of sulfur owing to their large inner void space; the RF coating carbon layer and the CNTs effectively increase the conductivity and build a network for providing smooth ions/e(-) pathways; In addition, the polar Co particles and electronegative N heteroatoms synergistically strengthen the chemical adsorption of polysulfides and accelerate the redox reaction of the sulfur cathode. Benefiting from these advantages, the as-fabricated Co, N-C@RFC/CNTs/S cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 1373.7 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, an impressive rate performance with 659.2 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C, and an outstanding cycling stability with an ultralow capacity decay rate of 0.041 % per cycle for 500 cycles at 1.0 C. This work provides a facile and high-efficiency approach to fabricating excellent-performance storage materials based on an MOF precursor.

Six isostructural frameworks were synthesized by diffusion of metal salts, TTF(py)(4), and either paramagnetic Li(TCNQ) or diamagnetic H(2)TCNQ They were characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction and FT-IR and UV-vis-NIR spectroscopy, and their physical properties were studied, including two postsynthetic modifications involving crystal-to-crystal transformations following a solid-solution reaction with I-2. The highly colored crystals of two isostructural Zn and Cd frameworks contain undulating Cd-TTF(py)(4) layers entwined with TCNQ in a chicken-wire net as part of the skeleton of the MOF as well as TCNQ intercalated within the channels, while nitrate anions are occluded within the cavities formed by the pyridine moieties. Reaction with I-2 replaces each intercalated TCNQ(center dot-) within the channels with I-3(-). The optical properties and the electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra indicate the presence of only radical TCNQ(center dot-) in the parent compounds, while the magnetic susceptibilities enabled an estimation of the amount of TCNQ(center dot-) (S = 1/2) leading to almost paramagnetic behavior. Solid-state electrochemistry provides evidence of several one-electron redox states corresponding to the electroactive cores.

J	Jin, YC; Zeng, P; An, JX; Xu, JP				Jin, Yuchang; Zeng, Pan; An, Junxiu; Xu, Jiuping			Negative life events and post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms: a moderated mediation model of only-child status and depressive symptoms	PUBLIC HEALTH			English	Article						Negative life events; Depressive symptoms; PTSS; Only-child status; Moderated mediation model	WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; FAMILY-SIZE; ASSOCIATIONS; ADOLESCENTS; PREVALENCE; SURVIVORS; DISTRESS; EXPOSURE	Objectives: Post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms (PTSS) and depressive symptoms are the most common adolescent psychological effects from earthquakes, with negative life events significantly influencing PTSS prolongation. However, the underlying mediating and moderating mechanisms that connect negative life events with PTSS remain unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate (i) the mediating role of depressive symptoms on negative life events and PTSS and (ii) the moderating role of only-child status in the direct and indirect relationship between negative life events and PTSS, 3 years after the 2013 Ya'an earthquake in China. Study design: Quantitative study using data from the Ya'an earthquake. Methods: Three years after the 2013 Ya'an earthquake, 4402 adolescent survivors in Lushan county were surveyed using the Adolescent Self-Rating Life Events Check list to assess the psychological effects of negative life events in the previous 12 months. In addition, the short Mood and Feeling Questionnaire and The Children's Revised Impact of Event Scale were used to assess depressive symptoms and PTSS severity, respectively. Results: After controlling for gender and age, negative life events were found to be significantly positively associated with PTSS. The mediation analyses revealed that depressive symptoms mediated the association between negative life events and PTSS; however, the moderated mediation analysis found the association was much weaker for only children. Conclusion: The findings supported and clarified the interrelations and associations between negative life events, depressive symptoms and PTSS. The conditional process analyses found that only-child status moderated not only the direct associations but also the relationship between negative life events and depressive symptoms. Our findings highlight the need for intervention programmes targeting adolescents, especially for children with siblings. (C) 2019 The Royal Society for Public Health. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In this paper, the applications of catenary optics in the near-field lithography are studied. The catenary shaped nanostructures and tip-insulator-metal (TIM) structures are simultaneously utilized to increase the contrast ratio of the focal plane and to give rise to a sharp focusing focal spot with high intensity. Moreover, the full width at half-maximum of the focal spot maintains well below the diffraction limit. The proposed catenary TIM structure may improve the quality of near-field lithography and find applications in super-resolution near-field direct writing nano-lithography.

J	Ding, ZL; Li, XQ; Cao, JY; Ji, XL				Ding, Zhouling; Li, Xiaoqing; Cao, Jianyong; Ji, Xiaoling			Thermal blooming effect of Hermite-Gaussian beams propagating through the atmosphere	JOURNAL OF THE OPTICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA A-OPTICS IMAGE SCIENCE AND VISION			English	Article							LASER-BEAMS; COHERENT; ARRAY	The thermal blooming effect of Hermite-Gaussian (H-G) beams propagating through the atmosphere is studied analytically and numerically. The analytical expression for the distortion parameter of steady-state thermal blooming of H-G beams propagating through the atmosphere is derived. It is shown that, under the same beam power, the higher the mode order of H-G beams, the weaker the thermal blooming effect. In particular, the thermal blooming effect for a H-G beam is weaker than that for a Gaussian beam. It is found that as the mode order increases, the beam width at the target may decrease due to the thermal blooming effect, although the initial beam width increases. When the cross-wind velocity is large enough, the symmetry of an asymmetric H-G beam may be improved by thermal blooming if the astigmatism parameter is adopted to characterize the symmetry of H-C beams. As the mode order of H-C beams increases, the shift of the beam centroid position decreases, but it takes more time to reach steady-state thermal blooming. On the other hand, the thermal blooming effect on the multimode beam quality is also examined in this paper. It is shown that a minimum beam spot on the target can be obtained if the optimal weighting factor of multimode beams is adopted.

However, for an FHS set, the researches on its AHC or PPHC are not well understood. In this paper, we first introduce a generalized method to construct new FHS sets through other FHS sets with optimal PPHC property. Via this method, we have the flexibility of choosing the parameters of newly constructed FHS sets, such that a large number of new FHS sets can be obtained. Then, we analyze the AHC performance of our newly constructed FHS sets. Finally, we present two new classes of FHS sets with good AHC property.

The Mg/Fe bimetallic particles were prepared by chemical displacement process and characterized by XRD, SEM and TEM. The in situ continuous production of H2O2/(OH)-O-center dot and the effect of the mole ratio of Mg to Fe in the Mg/Fe bimetallic particles and the operating parameters on the degradation 4-chlorophenol in Mg/Fe-O-2 system were investigated in detail. It was found that the Mg/Fe bimetallic particles with the mole ratio of Mg to Fe of 32:1 had the best performance for the 4-chlorophenol degradation and the maximum cumulative concentration of H2O2, the degradation efficiency of 4-chlorophenol and the removal efficiency of TOC in Mg/Fe-O-2 system were 34.5 mg/L, 100% and 91.8%, respectively, at pH 3, O-2 flow rate 400 mL/min, dosage of Mg/Fe bimetallic particles 2 g/L, 4-chlorophenol initial concentration 50 mg/L and reaction time 60 min. It was revealed by radical scavenging experiments that (OH)-O-center dot, particularly the surface-bound (OH)-O-center dot, were the predominant reactive oxygen species in Mg/Fe-O-2 system for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol. The main intermediates of 4-chlorophenol degradation were detected by high-resolution liquid chromatography equipped with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HRLC-ToF-MS) and ion chromatography (IC). Based the results of control experiments and the electrochemical tests, the possible pathway and mechanism of 4-chlorophenol degradation in Mg/Fe-O-2 system were tentatively proposed.

Biomaterials with the ability of skewing macrophage phenotype have attracted widespread attention in the field of tissue engineering. The aim of this study was to transform macrophage phenotype by a three-step process; anodizing, drug loading and coating with polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films. Interleukin (IL)-4, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was loaded into titania nanotubes (TNTs) on the titanium surface. Subsequently, sodium alginate (ALG) and chitosan (CS) were alternately assembled onto IL-4-loaded TNTs and cross-linked with genipin/calcium chloride, finally forming cross-linked PEM films. The IL-4 release profile and cellular immune response of the modified surface was investigated. In the simulated biological solution, only 20% of IL-4 were detected in the first 3 days, with a sustained release of approximately 5 ng over 10 days. The results of gene expression and protein secretion in macrophages indicated that IL-4-loaded PEM films significantly attenuated the inflammatory activity of macrophages at the later stage through down-regulating the mRNA and protein levels of inflammatory markers. In summary, IL-4 was controlled released from the cross-linked PEM films deposited on the nanotubes, leading to the temporal conversion of macrophage phenotype. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.

However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the effects of clonal integration on physiological responses of clonal plants suffering from heterogeneous water availability. A greenhouse experiment was conducted by using clonal fragments of the stoloniferous herb Centella asiatica with two successive ramets. The basal ramets were grown in patches with 40% soil moisture (high water availability), while the apical ramets were grown in patches with 40% (high water availability), 20% (medium water availability) and 10% soil moisture (low water availability) respectively. Stolons between the basal and apical ramets were severed (clonal integration impeded) or retained intact (clonal integration allowed). Our results showed that clonal integration relieved negative impact of water deficiency on the apical ramets in terms of photochemical activity and growth performance. Clonal integration modified biomass partitioning both for the apical ramets growing in low water availability and the basal ramets growing in high water availability. In addition, significant cost of clonal integration was observed in terms of growth performance of whole clonal fragments. A possible explanation is that increased biomass allocation to root may reduce capturing of light energy, producing negative effect on biomass accumulation of the basal ramets under high water availability contrast between patches. The results suggest that the net benefit of clonal integration may depend on the contrast of resource availability between interconnected ramets.

The corrosion property is investigated by electrochemical tests and metallographic microscope, and the anti-aging property is studied by accelerated UV-condensation exposure experiments. Owing to the abundant alkane chains, GO-DDA has good compatibility with CIC-23 matrix, providing the composite coating with favourable barrier property and corrosion resistance property. The GO-DDA/CIC-23 (1.2%) composite coating possesses the best corrosion resistance (E-corr: 0.063 +/- 0.0002 V, I-corr: (7.24 +/- 0.02)E-08 A/cm(2), PE %: 99.67 +/- 0.31%, and R-p: (1.51 +/- 0.004)E06 Omega cm(2)) among all samples. Moreover, the GO-DDA/CIC-23 (1.2%) coating has the optimal aging resistance, because the strong interfacial interaction between GO-DDA and CIC-23 matrix can obviously hamper the growth of cracks and decrease the channel of corrosion media to the metal surface. This work can provide guidelines on the development of highly effective corrosion inhibiting compounds from aircraft structure.

Furthermore, the transformation of hardening to softening behaviors induced by Sb substitution is exhibited and the corresponding microscopic mechanism is proposed. The CuO-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 ceramic without adding Sb exhibits extremely hardening characteristics (i.e., ultrahigh Q(m) of similar to 2426, low tanS of 0.32%, and pinched ferroelectric hysteresis loop) due to the formation of defect combinations ((Cu-Nb''' - V-o(center dot center dot)) and (V-o(center dot center dot)- Cu-Nb''' - V-o(center dot center dot))(center dot)). Whereas, the addition of Sb dramatically reduces the levels of defect combinations, leading to obviously softening properties (d(33) > 210 pC N-1, k(p) > 40%, low Q(m), and normal single P-E hysteresis loop). Our results indicate that the decrease of defect combinations with Sb addition should be responsible for the hardening-softening transformation of piezoelectricity and ferroelectricity in CuO-doped K0.5Na0.5Nb1.xSbxO3 piezoceramics.

The Hg(II) adsorption performance of CNTs-SH@Fe3O4 was evaluated using batch experiment and its physiochemical properties were investigated by characterization techniques. The batch experiment results showed that the prepared CNTs-SH@Fe3O4 maintained high Hg(II) adsorption efficiency (>98%) over wide pH range from 3 to 11. The selective adsorption of Hg(II) by CNTs-SH@Fe3O4 was achieved with the coexistence of Cu(II), Mg(II) or Zn(II) ions, in which adsorbate matrix Hg(II) removal efficiency of 81.39%, 8936% and 95.52% was obtained, respectively. CNTs-SH@Fe3O4 kept high Hg(II) removal efficiency (>80%) and good magnetic property (Ms value > 21 emg g(-1)) after five cycles of adsorption/regeneration. The Hg(II) adsorption kinetics could be better described by pseudo-second-order kinetic model. Freundlich model showed higher correlation coefficient in adsorption isotherms study, and the calculated maximum adsorption capacity was 172.4 mg g(-1). Thermodynamic study suggested that the adsorption process was exothermic in nature. Surface adsorption, complex adsorption and reduction adsorption were all contributed to the removal of Hg(II) using CNTs-SH@Fe3O4. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Lan, SJ; Tang, YH				Lan, Shaojun; Tang, Yinghui			PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS OF A DISCRETE-TIME Geo/G/1 RETRIAL QUEUE WITH NON-PREEMPTIVE PRIORITY, WORKING VACATIONS AND VACATION INTERRUPTION	JOURNAL OF INDUSTRIAL AND MANAGEMENT OPTIMIZATION			English	Article						Discrete-time retrial queue; working vacations; vacation interruption; non-preemptive priority; Markov chain	SERVER; CUSTOMERS; MODEL	This paper is concerned with a discrete-time Geo/G/1 retrial queueing system with non-preemptive priority, working vacations and vacation interruption where the service times and retrial times are arbitrarily distributed. If an arriving customer finds the server free, his service commences immediately. Otherwise, he either joins the priority queue with probability alpha, or leaves the service area and enters the retrial group (orbit) with probability (alpha) over bar (= 1 - alpha). Customers in the priority queue have non-preemptive priority over those in the orbit. Whenever the system becomes empty, the server takes working vacation during which the server can serve customers at a lower service rate. If there are customers in the system at the epoch of a service completion, the server resumes the normal working level whether the working vacation ends or not (i.e., working vacation interruption occurs). Otherwise, the server proceeds with the vacation. Employing supplementary variable method and generating function technique, we analyze the underlying Markov chain of the considered queueing model, and obtain the stationary distribution of the Markov chain, the generating functions for the number of customers in the priority queue, in the orbit and in the system, as well as some crucial performance measures in steady state. Furthermore, the relation between our discrete-time queue and its continuous-time counterpart is investigated.

The influences of the concentration of Gd3+ on the morphology, grain size and upconversion luminescence of the as-synthesized co-doped beta-NaY1-xGdxF4 crystals have been investigated in detail. Powder Xray diffraction results confirm that the obtained beta-NaY1-xGdxF4 crystals are pure hexagonal solid solution. Scanning electron microscope results indicate that the morphology of the final obtained beta-NaY1-xGdxF4 crystals gradually changes from hexagonal prism to sphericity with increasing x, and the grain size monotonically decreases accordingly. The upconversion emission intensity of Tm3+ in the beta-NaY(1-x)GdxF(4) microcrystals increases initially and then decreases sharply with increasing x, giving the maximum at x = 0.04. The observed upconversion emission intensity located at 475 nm in co-doped beta-NaY0.74Gd0.04F4 microcrystal is 1.5 times greater than that of the co-doped beta-NaYF4 microcrystal. A superior upconversion host matrix of beta-NaY(1-x)GdxF(4) solid solution can be obtained at the feasible concentration of Gd3+ (0 < x <= 6%).

The main obstacle is that there is still no effective way to characterize quantitatively the ferromagnetic exchange coupling (FEC) strength after inserting the interlayer. In this paper, a rationally designed hard/interlayer/soft layered film is used to study the interlayer effects. It is demonstrated that the magnetic properties of nanocomposite magnets can be effectively enhanced through the modification of interface. Here a new concept, using the nucleation field H-ns of soft phase as a "detector" to directly and quantitatively characterize/measure the FEC strength across interface and interlayer, is put forward. It is applied to address the dependence of FEC strength on thickness of nonmagnetic Cr and rare earth-rich phase interlayers. The detailed, distinguishing and typical decay behavior and length of FEC strength for these interlayers are successfully resolved for the first time. The new conception and experimental results get also strongly supported by the theoretical calculation. The nature or mechanism of exchange coupling between ferromagnetic grains or layers after adding the nonmagnetic interlayer is identified by using the hard/interlayer/soft layered film as a model system. Our results demonstrate the validity for characterizing/measuring quantitatively the FEC strength across different interlayer materials via strategy established in this work. It opens up new perspectives to gain insight into the interlayer property, and mechanism comprehension and high-performance design for magnetic materials and devices, such as permanent magnets, high-density magnetic recording media, advanced spin-orbit torque devices, etc.	[Abbas, Nadeem; Ren, Hanyang; Liu, J.

J	Zhang, T; Su, W; Jia, X; Zhou, XL				Zhang, Tian; Su, Wei; Jia, Xiao; Zhou, Xiao-Lin			Effects of Defect, Doping, Geometrical Configuration, and Size on Plasmon Excitations for Three Silicon Nanostructures	JOURNAL OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY C			English	Article							TOTAL-ENERGY CALCULATIONS; GRAPHENE PLASMONICS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; WAVE; APPROXIMATION; MODE	We investigate systematically the plasmon excitations for three silicon (Si2, Si6, and Si10) nanostructures (NS) based on time-dependent density functional theory and find that there are two obvious plasmon structures (pi-like and pi-sigma plasmons) in Si2 and Si10 NS, but only one pi-sigma plasmon is found in Si6 NS. Meanwhile, their plasmon excitations are rather sensitive to the polarization direction, especially for Si6 NS which is highly desirable for photosensitive switch materials in the visible region. Additionally, we also analyze in detail the effects of defect, doping, geometrical configuration, and size on their plasmon excitations and find that defects in Si10 NS would suppress the pi-sigma plasmon excitations but enhance the pi-like plasmon peak intensities in the visible region. When the defected Si10 NS are offset by other atoms, their pi-sigma plasmon excitations are increased, but their pi-like plasmon peak intensities are nearly unchanged, which indicates that the Si atom with threefold coordination is more beneficial in increasing the plasmon peak intensity in the visible region. We prove that the rectangular NS are the best choice for plasmonic materials, compared with triangular and hexagonal NS, and their larger nanostructural size is more beneficial in increasing plasmon peak intensities in high-energy regions. Our results reveal the physical mechanism for some geometrical parameters that affects plasmon structures in three silicon allotropes, providing a simple and qualitative perspective on optical performance, and thus are useful to design and control optical materials in the future.

The studies of the life span and influencing factors of metal mesh in the artificial soil in humid areas will guide ecological restoration of rock-cut slopes in Southwest China. Due to metal corrosion, the fixation function of the metal mesh could last for 10 years. The factors of soil contents, soil electrochemical properties and soil bacteria not only changed with the vegetation succession but also weakened the effect of the metal mesh on soil fixation for slope protection. The potential gradient, chloride ion content, sulfate ion content and water content were the main influencing factors for metal mesh corrosion during the vegetation restoration stage from 0 to 5 years, while the corrosion potential, potential gradient, chloride ion content, and water content were the main influential factors for metal mesh corrosion during the vegetation restoration stage after 11 years. At different vegetation restoration stages, the soil bacteria contained different dominant species, which had spatial heterogeneity, and the heterogeneity of the soil bacteria was another factor influencing the corrosion of the buried metal mesh. Meanwhile, the plant root as a soil fixation function strengthened with time, and 8 years later, the local woody plants gradually migrated to form a community dominated by multiple woody species. It is the first time that the life span of a metal mesh under the artificial soil of rock-cut slopes and factors affecting the different corrosion stages of the metal mesh in a humid area have been judged. The fixation function of plant root gradually replaces metal mesh, and main factors affecting the process include soil contents, soil electrochemical properties and soil bacteria. The research on corrosion factors of metal mesh under artificial soil for rock-cut slopes will contribute towards reducing the environmental risk of ecological restoration. (c) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The reduction of nitrate by ZVI is influenced by various factors, such as the physical and chemical characteristics of ZVI and the operational parameters. There are some problems for the nitrate reduction by ZVI alone, for example, the formation of iron oxides on the surface of ZVI at high pH condition, which will inhibit the further reduction of nitrate; in addition, the end reduction product is mainly ammonium, which itself needs to be concerned. Several strategies, such as the optimization of the structure of ZVI composites and the addition of reducing assistants, have been proposed to increase the reduction efficiency and the selectivity of end product of nitrate reduction in a wide range of pH, especially under neutral pH condition. This review will mainly focus on the high efficient reduction of nitrate by ZVI-based materials. Firstly, the reduction of nitrate by ZVI alone was briefly introduced and discussed, including the influence of physical and chemical characteristics of ZVI and some operational parameters on the reduction efficiency of nitrate. Then, the strategies for enhancing the reduction efficiency and the N-2 selectivity of the reductive products of nitrate were systematically analyzed and evaluated, especially the optimization of the structure of ZVI composites (e.g., doped ZVI composite, supported ZVI composite and premagnetized ZVI), and the addition of reducing assistants (e.g., metal cations, ligand, hydrogen gas and light) were highlighted. Thirdly, the mechanisms and pathways of nitrate reduction were discussed. Finally, concluding remarks and some suggestions for the future research were proposed. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, ultrafine and ligand-free Rh nanoparticles (NPs) (2.19 nm in diameter) were in-situ decorated on porous phosphorus-functionalized carbon (PPC) prepared by pyrolyzing hyper-cross-linked networks of triphenylphosphine and benzene. The resultant Rh/PPC showed excellent hydrogen production activity from AB hydrolysis (Turnover frequency: 806 min(-1)). Kinetic investigations indicated that AB hydrolysis using Rh/PPC exhibited first-order and zero-order reactions with Rh and AB concentrations, respectively. Activation energy (E-a) toward hydrogen generation from AB with Rh/PPC is as low as 22.7 kJ/mol. The Rh/PPC catalyst was recyclable and reusable for at least four times. The oxygen- and phosphorus-functional groups are beneficial for the affinity of Rh complex on the PPC surface, resulting in ultrafine and ligand-free Rh NPs with high dispersity and ability to supply abundant surface accessibility to catalytically active sites for AB hydrolysis.

An Integrative Way for Studying Neural Basis of Basic Emotions With fMRI	FRONTIERS IN NEUROSCIENCE			English	Review						basic emotions; core affects; monoamine; dimensional studies; fMRI	SURPRISE-INDUCED ENHANCEMENT; DYNAMIC FACIAL EXPRESSIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE NEURONS; HUMAN AMYGDALA; PSYCHOLOGICAL CONSTRUCTION; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; REWARD ANTICIPATION; PREDICTION ERRORS; CENTRAL NUCLEUS	How emotions are represented in the nervous system is a crucial unsolved problem in the affective neuroscience. Many studies are striving to find the localization of basic emotions in the brain but failed. Thus, many psychologists suspect the specific neural loci for basic emotions, but instead, some proposed that there are specific neural structures for the core affects, such as arousal and hedonic value. The reason for this widespread difference might be that basic emotions used previously can be further divided into more "basic" emotions. Here we review brain imaging data and neuropsychological data, and try to address this question with an integrative model. In this model, we argue that basic emotions are not contrary to the dimensional studies of emotions (core affects). We propose that basic emotion should locate on the axis in the dimensions of emotion, and only represent one typical core affect (arousal or valence). Therefore, we propose four basic emotions: joy-on positive axis of hedonic dimension, sadness-on negative axis of hedonic dimension, fear, and anger-on the top of vertical dimensions. This new model about basic emotions and construction model of emotions is promising to improve and reformulate neurobiological models of basic emotions.

In this study, we investigated the correlation between the participants'VWM capacity and their ability to voluntarily trade off the precision and number of items remembered. The two-phase resource allocation model proposed by Ye et al. (2017) suggests that for a given set size, it takes a certain amount of consolidation time for an individual to control attention to adjust the VWM resources to trade off the precision and number. To verify whether trade-off ability varies across VWM capacity, we measured each individua l's VWM capacity and then conducted a colour recall task to examine their trade-off ability. By manipulating the task requirement, participants were instructed to memorise either more colours in a low-precision way or fewer colours in a high-precision way. We conducted two experiments by adjusting stimulus duration to be longer than predicted critical value (Experiment 1) and duration shorter than predicted critical value (Experiment 2). While the results of Experiment 1 showed a positive correlation between the VWM capacity and trade-off ability, the results of Experiment 2 showed a lack of such correlation. These results are consistent with the prediction from the two-phase model.

Plants have developed special systems to respond to and tolerate cold stress. While plant scientists have discovered numerous genes involved in responses to cold stress, few studies have been dedicated to investigation of genome-wide chromatin dynamics induced by cold or other abiotic stresses.ResultsGenomic regions containing active cis-regulatory DNA elements can be identified as DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs). We develop high-resolution DHS maps in potato (Solanum tuberosum) using chromatin isolated from tubers stored under room (22 degrees C) and cold (4 degrees C) conditions. We find that cold stress induces a large number of DHSs enriched in genic regions which are frequently associated with differential gene expression in response to temperature variation. Surprisingly, active genes show enhanced chromatin accessibility upon cold stress. A large number of active genes in cold-stored tubers are associated with the bivalent H3K4me3-H3K27me3 mark in genebody regions. Interestingly, upregulated genes associated with the bivalent mark are involved in stress response, whereas downregulated genes with the bivalent mark are involved in developmental processes. In addition, we observe that the bivalent mark-associated genes are more accessible than others upon cold stress.ConclusionsCollectively, our results suggest that cold stress induces enhanced chromatin accessibility and bivalent histone modifications of active genes. We hypothesize that in cold-stored tubers, the bivalent H3K4me3-H3K27me3 mark represents a distinct chromatin environment with greater accessibility, which may facilitate the access of regulatory proteins required for gene upregulation or downregulation in response to cold stress.

Both retailers face uncertain demands, and their demand forecasts are private. The manufacturers, as Stackelberg leaders, can decide whether or not to acquire this private information from the retailers through contract design: either a wholesale price contract without information sharing, or a two-part tariff contract with information sharing. We derive the Bayesian-Nash equilibriums for contract choice. We find that the two-part tariff contract can be a dominant choice under certain conditions. Specifically, with a lump sum payment set by the two manufacturers, both manufacturers and retailers can benefit from a two-part tariff contract if product package substitutability is more intensive and the demand uncertainty level is relatively high, or if the product package competition is less intense. They do not benefit from the two-part tariff contract, however, if product package substitutability is more intense and the demand uncertainty is relatively low. In addition, by comparing to the case in which the demand is deterministic, we find that a two-part tariff contract with shared information is more likely to benefit both manufacturers and both retailers than a wholesale price contract without information sharing. The implications of the contract choices are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Molecular models of the star POSS-(PLLA)(x) and PLLA hybrids were constructed to investigate the geometrical characteristics of nanofiller and its effect on the compatibility of hybrids by using molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD). Geometric descriptors and dipole moments demonstrated that the molecular geometry of POSS-(PLLA)(x) nanofiller converted from a spiky ball to a panel-like shape as the number of L-lactide (LA) units in the arms attached to the POSS core increased from 9 to 12. The highest crystallinity was achieved in blends of PLLA with POSS-(PLLA)(12) forming panel-like shape since the longest arms in POSS( PLLA)(12) tended to be parallel, leading to an improved compatibility in hybrid. When blended with the spiky ball-like shape of POSS-(PLLA)(9), PLLA hybrid obtained the lowest crystallinity with an apparent plasticization in matrix, due to the steric barrier in adjacent chains resulting from mutually exclusive arms in POSS-(PLLA)(9). Moreover, consistent with the experimental results, analysis of the mean square displacement (MSD) and radial distribution function (RDF) confirmed that POSS-(PLLA)(x) nanofiller acted as a nucleating core for crystallization due to its limited mobility compared to the PLLA chain.

It is shown that the self-focusing effect on the self-healing of an Airy beam with the main lobe blocked can be ignored. Due to the self-focusing effect, an Airy beam with main lobe blocked can keep its Airy profile to further propagation distance than a complete Airy beam. This may offer a way to keep the acceleration of an Airy beam under the effect of nonlinearity. Due to the self-focusing effect, the self-accelerating of Airy beams becomes stronger when the beam power is not very high, which may be applied in practice. In particular, it is found that the resistance of an Airy beam to self-focusing effect is more remarkable than that of a Gaussian one.

Macrophages play an important role in inflammation due to their high plasticity. However, few reports have focused on the effect of antibacterial materials on macrophage polarization. In this work, micro/nano-structured titanium (MNT) was obtained through micro-arc oxidization. We synthesized silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) with an average diameter of 20 nm and immobilized AgNPs onto MNT via polydopamine to generate AgNP-decorated MNT (AgPD-MNT). Further, we investigated the antibacterial activity of the materials and the macrophage behaviors on the materials. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis indicated that metallic Ag and dopamine/polydopamine existed on the AgPD-MNT surface. The concentration of released Ag was less than 8 ppb after 21 days. AgPD-MNT showed high antibacterial efficacy against Escherichia coli without cytotoxicity toward osteoblasts. The macrophage proliferation and morphology results showed that AgPD-MNT had no cytotoxicity within 5 days and caused apoptosis after 7 days. The flow cytometry, enzyme-linked immuno sorbent assay and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction results manifested that the material groups (PD-MNT, MNT and AgPD-MNT) stimulated switching of macrophages to mixed phenotypes (M1-M2) in the early stage (within 5 days), whereas the expression of M2 macrophages was upregulated in the later stage. Among the material groups, AgPD-MNT showed the most significant regulation of macrophage polarization. Especially, AgPD-MNT induced adherent-macrophage apoptosis and upregulation of I kappa B to reduce inflammation. Hence, AgPD-MNT could promote wound healing and reduce the risk of implant-associated infection.

Here, we successfully grew Sr-4(Ru1-xFex)(3)O-10 (x = 0.01) crystal and systematically investigated the magnetotransport property of its nanosheets. We found a feature that there is an in-plane FM order aligned along < 110 > directions below T-C without the occurrence of the second magnetic transition at TM, which is in contrast to that expected in pure Sr4Ru3O10 nanosheets, where the in-plane FM order will rotate to the c direction below T-M. Furthermore, a metamagnetic-like transition is also observed below similar to 50 K at about 2 T when the magnetic field is applied along the c axis. These results unambiguously demonstrate that the second magnetic transition at T-M is actually a consequence of spin reorientation induced by the inherent coupling between the spin and lattice, which can be effectively tuned by element doping.

However, the residues are not efficiently biodegraded because microorganisms preferentially use the nutrients found in food and the environment for growth. In this study, the mechanisms underlying nutrient regulation during co-metabolic degradation of -CY by Bacillus licheniformis B-1 were investigated. The strain B-1 resting cells and the suspension containing NaN3 showed no significant differences in -CY degradation. The co-metabolic degradation and strain B-1 growth could be separately inhibited by iodoacetic acid and sodium fluoride. Adenosine monophosphate (AMP), fructose 1-6 bisphosphate (F1-6BP), Mg2+, and Mn2+ could improve the degradation, whereas adenosine triphosphate (ATP), alanine (Ala), phenylalanine (Phe), and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) were found to exert the opposite effect, indicating that -CY degradation was positively associated with pyruvate kinase activity. Furthermore, glycerol, urea, ammonium chloride and peptone improved -CY degradation in corn flour. The results provided a promising approach for nutrient regulation of pyrethroids biodegradation in food and the environment.

Relationship Between Network Embeddedness and Social Entrepreneurial Intention of University Students	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						network embeddedness; sense of opportunity identification efficacy; social entrepreneurial intention; university students; mediating role	DETERMINANTS; PERFORMANCE; IMPACT	Social entrepreneurship is an entrepreneurial activity centering on solving social problems and creating social values, which can effectively alleviate the problems of sustainable development such as an excessive gap between the rich and the poor, a lack of resources and so on, and can resolve the "triple failures" of government, the market and public welfare departments to a certain extent. As the subjective attitude of entrepreneurs, entrepreneurial intention can predict a representational incidence rate of entrepreneurial behavior. Therefore, aimed at university students, a special group of entrepreneurs, this paper constructs a theoretical framework of "network embeddedness - sense of opportunity identification efficacy - university students' social entrepreneurial intention" from the perspective of social cognitive theory through 466 pieces of valid survey data, and uses Stata 14 to construct a multiple linear regression model to explore the mechanism of action between the three. The results show that university students' sense of opportunity identification efficacy can significantly and positively stimulate their social entrepreneurial intention, and the network embeddedness (network scale and network intensity) of entrepreneurs is also significantly and positively correlated with their sense of opportunity identification efficacy; however, via the hierarchical regression model, it was found that the sense of opportunity identification efficacy can only partially mediate the relationship between network embeddedness and university students' social entrepreneurial intention, which is mainly manifested in the positive correlation between university students' social entrepreneurial intention and their network scale, and is unrelated to network intensity. This research contributes to enriching the theory of social entrepreneurial intention and guides the strengthening of university students' social entrepreneurial intention in reality.

Possessing eco-friendly and sustainable characteristics, electrochemical reduction is considered as a promising candidate for artificial N2 fixation under ambient conditions, but efficient electrocatalysts are crucial for the N2 reduction reaction (NRR). In this communication, we report that perovskite La2Ti2O7 nanosheets behave as an efficient NRR electrocatalyst with excellent selectivity under ambient conditions. In 0.1 M HCl, this catalyst achieves a high NH3 yield rate of 25.15 lg h 1 mgcat. 1 with a faradaic efficiency of 4.55% at 0.55 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode. Notably, it also shows high electrochemical stability.

The control of morphology and microstructure on micrometer and nanometer scales has been widely applied as one of the most promising approaches for upgrading the catalytic abilities of electrocatalysts. Herein, novel CoMnFe layered triple hydroxide (LTH) arrays with a unique nanosheet-nanowire structure grown directly on 3D Ni foam (NF) have been first synthesized by controlling the incorporation of Fe. According to the morphology evolution with the key factors of hydrothermal treatment time and Fe addition, a possible formation mechanism of the nanosheet-nanowire microstructure has been proposed. Remarkably, this nanosheet-nanowire nanostructure of Co4Mn1Fe3 LTH/NF can effectively lead to an intricate transportation network, uniform active site distribution at the nanoscale, electronic conductivity increase and open-channels for fast gas release, and thus significantly enhances the electrocatalytic activity of the material in the alkaline medium. The Co4Mn1Fe3 LTH/NF can reach a current density of 100 mA cm(-2) at an ultralow overpotential of 226 mV with a small Tafel slope of 55 mV dec(-1) and exhibit strong durability for at least 100 h. Such superior OER activity is comparable to that of reported state-of-the-art OER catalysts. This work may greatly advance the research towards designing efficient electrocatalysts for the OER.

We consider a type-II WSM model with two Weyl nodes located on the k(z) axis, and the tilting of the Weyl cones are along the k(x) direction. Due to coexisting electron and hole pockets, the density of states at the Fermi energy becomes finite, leading to a significant enhancement of the Kondo effect. Consequently, the magnetic impurity and the conduction electrons always form a bound state; this behavior is distinct from that in type-I WSMs, where the bound state is only formed when the hybridization exceeds a critical value. Meanwhile, the spin-orbit coupling and unique geometry of the Fermi surface lead to a strongly anisotropic Kondo screening cloud in coordinate space. The tilting terms break the rotational symmetry of the type-II WSM about the k(z) axis, but the system remains invariant under a combined transformation tau R-y(pi), where tau is the time-reversal operation and R-y(pi) is the rotation about the y axis by pi. Largely modified diagonal and off-diagonal components of the spin-spin correlation function on three principal planes reflect this change in band symmetry. Most saliently, on the x-z plane, tilting terms trigger the emergence of nonzero off-diagonal spin-spin correlation function J(yz) (r) and J(xy)(r), while in a type-I WSM they vanish on the x-z plane.

Through introducing a transform to deal with the complicated boundary conditions, first, the existence of the invariant measure is established. Since the degenerate noise only drives the latitudinal atmosphere surface temperature, it then proposes to combine the strong Feller property with the asymptotically strong Feller and the irreducibility to verify the uniqueness of the invariant measure. It further implies the ergodicity of the system.

Evidently, the q-ROFS can depict more fuzzy assessment information and consider decision-maker's (DM's) hesitance. Thus, the concept of a dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy set (DHq-ROFS) is developed in this paper. Then, based on Hamacher operation laws, weighting average (WA) operator and weighting geometric (WG) operator, some dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher aggregation operators are developed, such as the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher weighting average (DHq-ROFHWA) operator, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher weighting geometric (DHq-ROFHWG) operator, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average (DHq-ROFHOWA) operator, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighting geometric (DHq-ROFHOWG) operator, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher hybrid average (DHq-ROFHHA) operator, and the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy Hamacher hybrid geometric (DHq-ROFHHG) operator. The precious merits and some particular cases of above mentioned aggregation operators are briefly introduced. In the end, an actual application for scheme selection of construction project is provided to testify the proposed operators and deliver a comparative analysis.

Microparticles are the most commonly used drug delivery systems, because they can be easily administrated to patients, and be engineered with different structures and functions for keeping drug stability, delivering drugs to a desired location, and releasing drugs with a predetermined rate in a well-controlled manner. Microfluidic techniques show great power for controllable generation of highly monodisperse multiple emulsion droplets with unprecedented structural diversity. Microfluidics-templated emulsions allow elaborately design and controllable generation of highly uniform microparticles with well-controlled sizes, shapes, compositions, and structures, and integrated functions for controlled drug release. This review highlights recent progress on controllable microfluidic fabrication of monodisperse emulsion templates and the resultant polymeric microparticles with well-tailored structures and functions for flexible encapsulation and controlled release of drugs.

However, their relatively poor electric conductivity might not completely meet the requirements of comprehensive application of supercapacitor. Herein, to further promote conductivity of porous carbon, an all carbon nanocomposite was successfully fabricated by implanting carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into the surface and edge of hierarchical porous carbon (HPC). The sp(2) CNTs endows the composites with high conductivity and connect porous carbons to each other, which renders rapid ion transfer and store during charge/discharge process. Benefiting from strong bonding effects due to plentiful heteroatom functional groups, the nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon/CNT hybrid exhibits considerable charge transport ability, superior specific capacitance of 293.1 F g(-1) at current density of 1 A g(-1) and high rate capability of 207.0 F g(-1) at 30 A g(-1). Furthermore, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor displays a high energy density of 27.46 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 874.98 W kg(-1). The unique hierarchical three-dimensional hybrid structure provides a novel way to develop conductive carbon electrode materials for advanced super capacitors.

After that, a summary of typical applications in sensors based on either heating or wetting activated shape recovery using largely commercial engineering polymers, which are programmed by means of in-plane pre-deformation (load applied in the length/width direction) or out-of-plane pre-deformation (load applied in the thickness direction), is presented. As demonstrated by a number of examples, many low-cost engineering polymers are well suited to, for instance, anti-counterfeit and over-heating/wetting monitoring applications via visual sensation and/or tactual sensation, and many existing technologies and products (e.g., holography, 3D printing, nano-imprinting, electro-spinning, lenticular lens, Fresnel lens, QR/bar code, Moire pattern, FRID, structural coloring, etc.) can be integrated with the shape memory feature.

However, the absence of high-performance cathode materials is one of the main challenges for the development of calcium-ion batteries. Herein, a bilayered Mg0.25V2O5 center dot H2O as a stable cathode for rechargeable calcium-ion batteries is identified. Remarkably, an unexpected stable structure of the material for Ca2+ storage is demonstrated. It is found that the interlayer spacing shows only a tiny variation of similar to 0.09 angstrom during Ca2+ insertion/extraction, which results in its outstanding cycling stability (capacity retention of 86.9% after 500 cycles) for Ca2+ storage. On the basis of in situ/ex situ experimental characterizations and ab initio simulation, the origin of such superior structural stability is revealed. This ultrastable cathode together with the understanding lays a strong foundation for developing high-performance calcium-ion batteries.

The establishment of convenient to use, effective gene tools with which the organism can be rapidly modified is essential if its full potential is to be realized. Here, we developed a genomic editing tool (pCBEclos) for use in C. beijerinckii based on the fusion of cytidine deaminase (Apobec1), Cas9 (D10A) nickase and uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor (UGI). Apobec1 and UGI are guided to the target site where they introduce specific base-pair substitutions through the conversion of C<bold>G to TA</bold>. By appropriate choice of target sequence, these nucleotide changes are capable of creating missense mutation or null mutations in a gene. Through optimization of pCBEclos, the system derived, pCBEclos-opt, has been used to rapidly generate four different mutants in C. beijerinckii, in pyrE, xylR, spo0A, and araR. The efficiency of the system was such that they could sometimes be directly obtained following transformation, otherwise only requiring one single restreaking step. Whilst CRISPR-Cas9 nickase systems, such as pNICKclos2.0, have previously been reported in C. beijerinckii, pCBEclos-opt does not rely on homologous recombination, a process that is intrinsically inefficient in clostridia such as C. beijerinckii. As a consequence, bulky editing templates do not need to be included in the knockout plasmids. This both reduces plasmid size and makes their construction simpler, for example, whereas the assembly of pNICKclos2.0 requires six primers for the assembly of a typical knockout plasmid, pCBEclos-opt requires just two primers. The pCBEclos-opt plasmid established here represents a powerful new tool for genome editing in C. beijerinckii, which should be readily applicable to other clostridial species.

The concentration of F (-) in groundwater samples ranged from 0.1 to 3.9 mg/L (mean = 1.0 mg/L) in Sindh and 0.1-10.3 mg/L (mean = 1.0 mg/L) in Punjab, respectively with 28.9% and 26.6% of samples exhibited F- contamination beyond WHO permissible limit value (1.5 mg/L). The geochemical processes regulated F- concentration in unconfined aquifer mainly in Sindh and Punjab were categorized as follows: 1) minerals weathering that observed as the key process to control groundwater chemistry in the study areas, 2) the strong correlation between F- and alkaline pH, which provided favorable environmental conditions to promote F- leaching through desperation or by ion exchange process, 3) the 72.6% of samples from Sindh and Punjab were dominated by Na+- Cl- type of water, confirmed that the halite dissolution process was the major contributor for F- enrichment in groundwater, 4) dolomite dissolution was main process frequently observed in Sindh, compared with Punjab, 5) the arid climatic conditions promote evaporation process or dissolution of evaporites or both were contributing to the formation of saline groundwater in the study area, 6) the positive correlation observed between elevated F- and fluorite also suggested that the fluorite dissolution also played significant role for leaching of F- in groundwater from sediments, and 7) calcite controlled Ca2+ level and enhanced the dissolution of F-bearing minerals and drive F- concentration in groundwater. In a nut shell, this study revealed the worst scenarios of F- contamination via various possible geochemical mechanisms in groundwater along major rivers in Sindh and Punjab, Pakistan, which need immediate attention of regulatory authorities to avoid future hazardous implications.

Through properly modeled chain growth behaviors, differences of scaffolds forming between TME and glycerol polyesters are thoroughly discussed. The scaffolds of polyol-polyesters can be easily controlled by adjusting feed ratio and temperature. However, to achieve regular dendritic scaffolds, apart from the monomer feed ratio of 1/1 and high temperature(80 degrees C), selection of proper polyols is much more important. TME with three equal primary hydroxyls tends to undergo pure dendritic growth, forming into regular scaffolds while glycerol with secondary hydroxyls is inclined to have linear and grafted growth successively, which results in irregular dendritic scaffolds. However, glycerol polyesters tend to have linear growth under mild temperature (40 degrees C), hence, regular linear scaffolds can be obtained. Besides, a scaffold determination and control system are built up, giving general guidance of obtaining polol-polyesters with targeted topologies.

J	Liang, XJ; Tang, YH				Liang, Xiaojun; Tang, Yinghui			The improvement upon the reliability of the k-out-of-n:F system with the repair rates differentiation policy	OPERATIONAL RESEARCH			English	Article						Reliability improvement; k-out-of-n:F system; Repair-rate differentiation policy; Expected waiting time for repair	SERVICE-LEVEL DIFFERENTIATION; TOLERANCE LIMITS; DYNAMIC CONTROL; STANDBY SYSTEM; QUEUE	A manufacturing system includes not only the production system but also a repair facility. With increasing number of repairs, the repaired components will become more fragile and need more time to repair when they fail. In such case, the repair facility might suffer a "congestion" dilemma if the failed components cannot be repaired immediately. This paper investigates the reliability improvement of a k-out-of-n:F system under repair-rate differentiation policy, which might decrease the expected waiting time for repair without an increase in repair capacity. First, by comparing the mean queue-length in front of the repair facility, we show that the mixed-repair policy developed in this paper is dominant over the pure-repair policy in relieving the repair congestion problem. Then, we derive the optimal solution under the repair-rate differentiation policy, which minimizes the expected waiting time for repair of the failed components. Finally, when the buffer area is exhausted or component deterioration becomes too severe, the time of batch replacement is proposed in a practical example of the textile mill.

Molecular phylogeny and taxonomy of subgenus Eothenomys (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae: Eothenomys) with the description of four new species from Sichuan, China	ZOOLOGICAL JOURNAL OF THE LINNEAN SOCIETY			English	Article						ecological sky-island species; Eothenomys; Ermites; mitochondrial DNA; new species; unclear DNA	BAYESIAN-INFERENCE; MODELS; TREES	The systematics of the subgenus Eothenomys (Cricetidae: Arvicolinae) is controversial because of the morphological similarity among species and the incomplete sampling of taxa. Here, we gather specimens of Oriental voles from throughout their distributions. We sequence and analyse two mitochondrial and three nuclear gene segments. A principal components analysis serves to evaluate morphological variation among taxa of the subgenera Eothenomys and Ermites. Our analyses support recent revisions on the systematics of Eothenomys as follows: (1) Eothenomys melanogaster colurnus requires elevation to a valid species; (2) subgenus Eothenomys includes the species Eothenomys colurnus, E. cachinus, E. eleusis, E. fidelis, E. melanogaster, E. miletus and an unidentified taxon; (3) Eothenomys melanogaster libonotus and E. miletus confinii are junior synonyms of E. cachinus; Eothenomys melanogaster kanoi is a junior synonym of E. colurnus; and (4) one unidentified taxon of subgenus Eothenomys and three unidentified taxa of subgenus Ermites constitute new species, which we describe as Eothenomys shimianensis sp. nov., E. jinyangensis sp. nov., E. meiguensis sp. nov. and E. luojishanensis sp. nov., respectively. Our analyses indicate that the teeth of Oriental voles present extensive heteromorphosis. A species of subgenus Eothenomys from an isolated area may possess two or three tooth patterns. The three unidentified species of subgenus Ermites are ecological sky-island species whose origins are attributable to rapid adaptive evolution caused by ecosystem isolation.

It was proposed as a generalization of a fuzzy set to deal with indeterminate and inconsistent information. In this study, we shall present some novel Dice similarity measures of PFSs and the generalized Dice similarity measures of PFSs and indicates that the Dice similarity measures and asymmetric measures (projection measures) are the special cases of the generalized Dice similarity measures in some parameter values. Then, we propose the generalized Dice similarity measures-based multiple attribute group decision-making models with Pythagorean fuzzy information. Then, we apply the generalized Dice similarity measures between PFSs to multiple attribute group decision making. Finally, an illustrative example is given to demonstrate the efficiency of the similarity measures for selecting the desirable ERP system.

The species is listed as an Endangered (EN) species by the IUCN red list of threatened animals. And it also has been listed as EN by the red list of China's vertebrates. We provide a complete mitogenome of M. leucogaster and examine its phylogenetic position with other seven Artiodactyla species. The complete mitogenome is a circular molecule of 16,431bp in length, containing 13 protein-coding genes, two ribosome RNA genes, 22 transfer RNA genes and one non-coding regions. Using Bayesian phylogenetic methods, we constructed a phylogenetic tree and demonstrated M. leucogaster was a sister relationship to M. chrysogaster. This report provides basic data to conservation genetics and evolution for this EN species.

Tubular nitrogen-doped carbon materials synthesized by thermally annealing green foxtail with melamine were investigated as a metal-free electrocatalyst for efficient cathode ORR. Owing to the high specific surface area, tubular and porous structure, and abundant active centers of the pyridinic and graphite nitrogen incorporated carbon matrix, the nitrogen-doped carbon materials showed excellent activity toward ORR in a neutral electrolyte. Oxygen was reduced to water in a four electron reaction on the three-phase boundary of the as-prepared materials. The microbial fuel cell with the nitrogen-doped carbon electrocatalyst prepared at 800 degrees C had a satisfactory power density and better stability than commercial Pt/C due to its metal-free property and porous structure. Thus, nitrogen-doped carbon materials derived from economical and sustainable biomass could be a potential alternative for the metal-free ORR catalyst in microbial fuel cells with low cost and high electricity generation efficiency.

This framework will be used to analyze the support of an enterprise's dynamic innovation capabilities for its innovation strategies behaviors under the transition period of uncertain environment. Based on the theoretical framework, an in-depth study was conducted on the case of Qihoo 360's micro-innovation based on "free and secure" products. According to analysis of specific Qihoo 360 "micro-innovation", we understood that dynamic innovation capabilities are the support maintaining an enterprise's competitiveness. Furthermore, it was found that Qihoo 360 became the leading figure in the internet security industry by providing an "iteration process" of all products on a "non-payment" and "security" basis. This Paper contributed to the further enrichment of the connotations of dynamic innovation capabilities and analysis of the mechanism of micro-innovation strategy, and the dynamic supporting mechanism of enterprise dynamic innovation capabilities on its micro-innovation strategy is studied under the background of uncertainty environment. It provides theoretical support and practical guidance for Internet enterprises to carry out innovation activities in an uncertain environment.

The previous methods for initialization require either an exponential number of experiments, or cause signal reduction or place restrictions on molecular structures. In this study, we propose three types of quantum circuits for preparing the pseudo-pure states of (n - 1) qubits in the n-coupled Hilbert space, which simply needs the assistance of one ancilla spin and two different experiments independent of n. Most importantly, our methods work well on homo-nuclear and hetero-nuclear molecules without the reduction of signals in the gradient field. As a proof-of-principle demonstration, we experimentally prepared the pseudo-pure states of heteronuclear 2-qubit and homonuclear 4-qubit molecules using a nuclear magnetic resonance quantum information processor.

Unfortunately, the mechanisms responsible for improved gas sensing performance due to oxygen vacancies are not yet well understood because the formation of oxygen vacancy-rich sensors is always accompanied by other variations, especially changes in chemical composition, particle size, and surface morphology. In this work, ZnFe2O4 with controllable oxygen vacancies was prepared by a facile one-step self-catalyzed treatment, "shake and heat", in which commercial ZnFe2O4 served as the raw material and catalyst for tartaric acid oxidation. Compared to commercial ZnFe2O4, the as-prepared ZnFe2O4 had a similar crystal structure, particle size and morphology but possessed controllable oxygen vacancies, which was validated by XRD, SEM and XPS. The asprepared oxygen vacancy-rich ZnFe2O4 showed superior performance in sensing acetone compared to the raw materials, i.e., commercial ZnFe2O4. It is proposed that the sensing properties improved because the oxygen vacancies narrowed the band gap and adsorbed more oxygen. This work proves that oxygen vacancies can indeed improve the sensing properties alone and demonstrate a new facile synthesis strategy for oxygen vacancyrich sensors.

In the present investigation, we realized ultra-high selective hydrogenation of quinoline to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (py-THQ) under atmospheric conditions by encapsulating 7 +/- 2 nm Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) inside the 10 +/- 2 nm nanochannels of carbon nanotubes (CNTs). For the prepared Pd@CNTs catalysts, the encapsulated PdNPs was found to selectively absorb the nitrogen heterocyclic ring of quinoline, which led to the increase of average length of C-C bonds in the heterocyclic ring, further resulting in selective activation of the heterocyclic ring and similar to 100% selectivity to py-THQ. The DFT calculations confirmed the selective hydrogenation feature of Pd@CNTs. In contrast, the Pd-CNTs catalyst with PdNPs supported on the outer surface of CNTs is incapable of selectively activate the heterocyclic ring of quinoline, showing poor selectivity and catalytic activity. The Pd@CNTs catalysts also exhibited universal ultra-high selectivity to other quinoline derivatives (7-Methylquinoline, quinaldine and quinoxaline) and oxygen heterocyclic compounds (2,3-benzofuran). Due to the confined effect, the Pd@CNTs catalysts presented superior cycling stability to the Pd-CNTs and activated carbon (AC) impregnated with Pd (Pd-AC) catalysts. The Pd@CNTs catalyst was also found to highly stable in air storage for months, without loss of activity.

The adsorption stability of metronidazole on the surface of anatase was studied under the condition of vacuum and neutral aqueous solvent respectively, and the most stable adsorption configuration was optimized theoretically. It was found that metronidazole could be adsorbed on the surface of TiO2 under both conditions. The hydrogen bond generated by the adsorption process can enhance the stability of the adsorption structure. The surface adsorption made the CeN bond length of metronidazole longer, which could facilitate the reaction of open-loop degradation. The mechanism of ring-opening degradation of metronidazole on two surfaces of TiO2 was also studied. It was found that the activation energy of the degradation reaction of metronidazole on the crystal plane of TiO2 was decreased under the condition of water solvent, which indicated that the solvent condition could promote the degradation of metronidazole. The utilization efficiency of different crystal planes of TiO2 in the visible light and predicted the photocatalysis were achieved. The study found that TiO2 (101) crystal plane catalytic degradation of metronidazole has high visible light utilization rate, explaining the experimental results.

J	Mu, Y; Lan, JQ; Zhou, XL; Chen, QF				Mu, Yi; Lan, Jun-Qing; Zhou, Xiao-Lin; Chen, Qi-Feng			Electronic transport of SiC molecular chains in parallel via first-principles calculations	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							SUPERPOSITION LAW; CONDUCTANCE; CARBON; WIRES; DIFFRACTION; DIODES	Motivated by the trend of increasing miniaturization and multifunctional implementation, the electronic transport properties of two silicon carbide (SiC) molecular chains in parallel sandwiched between two semi-infinite Au(100)-3 x 6 electrodes are investigated using the densityfunctional theory and nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. The p-bonding molecular orbitals resulting from the in-phase combination of two p(x) or p(y) atomic orbitals of the C and Si atoms are found to play a key role in the electronic transport, and the possible electron pathways are summarized. Our results show that changing the separation between the two chains in a certain range can produce remarkable differences in transport properties. When the two chains are in small separation (d = 2.884 angstrom), their strong electrostatic interaction makes a constructive contribution to the electronic transport properties, in which the underlying physical mechanism has been revealed. We also find that d = 5.768 angstrom is the critical distance both for the transport difference and for the electrostatic interaction in the top-top configuration. Both the conductance (classical Kirchhoff's superposition law) and the current follow the superposition law well in the atomic scale when d = 5.768 angstrom, much smaller than the critical distance of 15.5 A from the result of Zhou et al. [Carbon 95, 503 (2015)]. Additionally, the superposition law is more valid for a larger chain spacing (d >= 5.768 angstrom). Our work demonstrates that the realization of the superposition law and the way of increasing current and rectification effect may lay the foundation for the miniaturization exploration and multifunctional implementation of SiC chain related molecular devices.

Herein, a new sulfate nonlinear optical material, RbSbSO4Cl2, was prepared via a facile hydrothermal synthetic route. The title compound crystallizes in the polar non-centrosymmetric (NCS) space group P2(1)2(1)2(1) and exhibits an intricate three-dimensional network constructed by interconnecting RbO5Cl4, SbO3Cl2 distorted polyhedra and a SO4 tetrahedron. The powder second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements display that RbSbSO4Cl2 exhibits a strong SHG response of about 2.7 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) and is type I phase-matchable. Theoretical calculation analysis confirmed that the large SHG effect originated from the synergistic effect of three coexisting NCS chromophores: Sb3+ with SCALP effect, highly polarizable Rb+ cations and a SO4 distorted tetrahedron.

J	Ran, R; Cheng, C; Zeng, ZY; Chen, XR; Chen, QF				Ran, Ran; Cheng, Cai; Zeng, Zhao-Yi; Chen, Xiang-Rong; Chen, Qi-Feng			Mechanical and thermal transport properties of monolayer PbI2 via first-principles investigations	PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE			English	Article						Lead iodide (PbI2); Density functional theory (DFT); Elastic properties; Thermal transport	2-DIMENSIONAL MATERIALS; OPTICAL-PROPERTIES; ELECTRONIC-STRUCTURE; BAND-STRUCTURE; CONDUCTIVITY; GRAPHENE; SEMICONDUCTOR; PHASE; GAP	With the synthesis of single-layer lead iodide (PbI2) in the laboratory in recent years, it has been widely used due to its stable structure and suitable bandgap (2.5 eV). We carried out first-principles calculations and a theoretical analysis to investigate the mechanical properties, electronic structure, and thermal transport properties of monolayer PbI2. We computed the elastic constant C-11 = 14.69 N m(-1), layer modulus = 9.35 N m(-1), and Young's modulus E-2D = 13.63 N m(-1). Our results indicate that monolayer PbI2 is more flexible than other two-dimensional materials, and it has good ductility. The Poisson's ratio v of monolayer PbI2 is 0.27, which means that ionic forces play a major role in the interatomic bonding for PbI2 layered by van der Waals forces. We also did first-principles calculations for the lattice thermal transport properties of monolayer PbI2 through the ShengBTE code. The calculated thermal conductivity of monolayer PbI2 at 300 K is 0.66 W/m K, which agrees well with the experimental data of 0.68 W/m K. Furthermore, its thermal conductivity is much lower than that of other two-dimensional materials. We concluded that the acoustic modes of monolayer PbI2 make a major contribution to its thermal conductivity.

In the absence of spin-orbital coupling (SOC), the spin-up bands host a pair of triply degenerate points together with a bird-cage-like node structure. In the presence of SOC with (001) magnetization, each triplet point splits into a double Weyl point and a single Weyl point accompanied by two nodal rings, forming two sets of WNPL fermions near the Fermi level. The novel properties of the WNPL fermion are explored by revealing the unusual Berry curvature field and demonstrating the pinned chiral surface states with exotic Fermi arcs. Our work offers new ideas for exploring novel topological semimetal states with diverse band-crossing dimensions and provides a candidate for future experimental realization.

A meticulously designed co-substitution approach was used to successfully replace the [TiO6](8-) and [PO4](3-) functional groups in KTiOPO4 (KTP) with [SbO4F2](7-) and [SO4](2-) units, respectively. The structure of CsSbF2SO4 features a pseudo-3D framework consisting of interconnected 1D [SbF2O2SO4](5-) chains of corner-sharing [SbO4F2](7-) octahedra and [SO4](2-) tetrahedra. The title compound exhibits a sharply enlarged band gap compared to its parent compound, KTP, benefitting from the introduction of F- ions and the displacement of Sb3+ cations. Second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements manifested that CsSbF2SO4 is phase-matchable and revealed a strong SHG response of about 3.0KH(2)PO(4) (KDP), which is the highest value reported for any metal sulfate reported to date. The reported fluoride sulfate is a promising near ultraviolet (UV) nonlinear optical (NLO) material.

It is found that the uniform irradiation may appear on propagation of an initial flat-topped beam from the ground to space orbits because of the phase modulation caused by self-focusing in the inhomogeneous atmosphere. This may offer a way to achieve the uniform irradiation under the effect of inhomogeneous nonlinearity. The uniform irradiation on the target is interesting for the laser space-debris clearing. To achieve the uniform irradiation on the debris target, we present the fitting formula of the modified focal length, which presents an effective design rule for the uniform irradiation on the debris target. In addition, the influence of the beam order on the beam quality due to self-focusing is also investigated.

Panel data on twenty-nine provinces in China are examined to verify the TLEG theory in this study. The estimated generalized least squares (cross-section weights) method is applied to test the influence of tourism on human capital. Our empirical analysis shows that the development of tourism negatively affects human capital endogenously. Conclusions are provided at the end of this paper accordingly.

The steric hindrance effect generated by the introduction of large alkali-metal cations and partial substitution of small Li+ cations broke the three-dimensional (3-D) framework of [B3O7](5-) borate-oxygen clusters in LBO and resulted in a - structure rearrangement to produce infrequent [B10O26](22-) 2-D layers. The unique layered structure induced an increase in birefringence in A-LBOs (A = K, Rb, Cs), which is favorable for phase matching during second-harmonic generation. All three compounds are potential deep-ultraviolet nonlinear optical materials, which was proved by UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy and second-harmonic-generation measurements.

Although many computer-assisted tools have been developed to capture and narrow the differences among learners, the use of these strategies may be highly risky because changing the environments or the participants may lead to failure. In this paper, we propose an artificial neural network (ANN)-based computational model to simulate the environment to which students are exposed. The ANN computational model equips English teachers with the ability to quickly find the predicting factors to learners' overall English competences and also provides teachers with the ability to find abnormal students, based on reviewing their individualized ANN trajectories. Finally, by observing the compound effects of cognitive factors using the same evaluation scale, new hypotheses about the mutual relationships among the phonological awareness, phonological short-term memory, and long-term memory abilities of their students can be generated. Our experimental ANNs suggested three detailed corresponding conclusions for the participants' English teachers. These results provide teachers with guidance in designing and applying cognitive ability-related intervention strategies in their L2 pedagogical activities.

Photochemical vapor generation (Photo-CVG) is a new subset of CVG and it has been demonstrated a powerful alternative to conventional CVG techniques due to its inherent advantages. For a long time, most research works have been devoted to improving vapor generation efficiency and expanding the vaporable element scope of Photo-CVG. Nowadays, with the help of nanomaterials and enhancement reagents, Photo-CVG covers a wide range of detectable elements and the vapor generation efficiency of some elements has been improved significantly. In this review, we summarizes the developments and applications of nanomaterials/enhancement reagents assisted Photo-CVG for analytical atomic spectrometry, including TiO2 and TiO2-based composites, MOFs and some metal ions utilized as photocatalysts, photo-oxidation/reduction and enhancement reagents; as well as nanomaterials for preconcentration/separation in Photo-CVG systems.

Measuring cultivated land area is costly and inefficient, however, as this land use type is often widely dispersed and scattered. A new method is therefore explored in this study that utilizes a Phantom2 Vision + (P2V), one kind of Dajiang (DJI) unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The method proposed here includes generating rural settlement images using a P2V UAV, subsequently correcting them using a camera lens model, matching them with geo-coded high resolution alternatives, mosaicking them, measuring the area of cultivated land reclaimed from rural settlements, evaluating measurement accuracy, and analyzing overall efficiency. The results of this study show that use of a P2V UAV is reasonable in price, less than 8000 yuan (RMB), and that this method is able to measure cultivated land area reclaimed from rural settlements with 99% accuracy. This method is therefore low cost, highly efficient, and low risk, as well as being easy to learn and use. This UAV-based approach is also likely to be easily popularized and be particularly useful both for application across plains and flats as well as over mountains and hills. The method proposed in this study is also likely to prove beneficial for monitoring and managing rural land use and future consolidation.

For the selective measurement proposal, we explicitly show that the counter-rotating terms (CRTs) become as significant as rotating wave terms (RWTs) with increase of temperature. We also derive an analytic expression for the survival probability which correctly captures the leading contribution for both RWTs and CRTs in the frequent measurement limit. Beyond this limit, we observe a nonexponential decay of the survival probability by further considering the effect of the variation of initial states during repeated measurements. For the nonselective measurement proposal, we find that the survival probability demonstrates the same behavior as in the selective measurement case in the short-time regime while it deviates from an exponential form and approaches a nonvanishing value in the long-time scale due to the repopulation effect.

The Gorenstein super finitely presented dimension of R is defined as G- s.gl>M is a super finitely presented R-module}. In this paper, we give a series of characterizations of the ring with )=0. We show that R is a ring with G-<mml:mspace )=0 if and only if R is self-weak injective and R is a generalized coherent ring (i.e., R is a GFC-ring), where an R-module M is called weak injective if ExtR1(N,M)=0 for every super finitely presented R-module N, and R is called a generalized coherent ring if M is super finitely presented for any super finitely presented R-module M. Further, comparing with FGF-question, we give an example to show that a ring R is not necessarily a QF-ring if every (super) finitely presented R-module can embedded in a free R-module.

Here, a dual polysulfide confinement strategy is designed by fabricating an in-situ N/P co-doped carbon, which is originating from versatile silk cocoons through a combined technology of phosphoric acid activation and carbonization and acts as both sulfur host and self-standing interlayer in Li-S batteries. The N/P co-doped porous carbon host (NPPC) provides both the physical restriction and chemical adsorption of polysulfides, while the polar interlayer is used as not only an efficient barrier for blocking polysulfides but also a second current collector, which can reuse the sulfur species, enhance the cycling stability and rate capacity. With this rational design, the NPPC/S cathode with the free-standing interlayer exhibits an initial specific capacity of 1412.6 MAh g(-1) at 0.1 C, outstanding cycling stability with the ultra-low capacity decay of 0.032% per cycle over 500 cycles at 1.0 C and splendid rate performance with 758.1 mAh g(-1) at 2.0 C. Our work provides an ecofriendly and dual employed strategy for boosting the commercialization of Li-S batteries.

This assay was based on two basic phenomena: first, melamine could bind to thymine (T) through hydrogen bond to form thymine-melamine-thymine (T-M-T) hairpin structure. Second, combination force between mercury ions (Hg2+) and I- was much stronger than that between Hg2+ and thymine, therefore, I- could combine Hg2+ from the thymine-Hg2+ -thymine (T-Hg2+-T) hairpin structure. A T-rich single-strand DNA sequence was designed for the two targets detection, which can associate with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and K+ to form G-quadruplex-NMM complex, producing a strong fluorescence signal. The concentration of free probe DNA was proportional to the amount of melamine or I-, enabling convert the target reaction events into detectable signal of G-quadruplex-NMM by fluorescence spectrometer. Under the optimized conditions, the limits of detections (LODs) were 0.08 nM and 4.6 nM for melamine and I-, respectively, which was comparable to that of other melamine and I- assays. The relative standard deviations (RSDs) (n = 7) were 1.8% and 0.3%, respectively. Besides, melamine and I- in real samples could be detected with satisfactory results. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including simple, sensitive and selective for label-free analysis.

However, the rationale for this cholesterol metabolism has not been fully understood yet. In the present study, we characterized several previously undescribed acyl-CoA synthetases that are involved in the steroid side-chain degradation in Mycobacterium smegmatis, and an analogue of intermediate from steroid degradation, 5'-O-(lithocholoyl sulfamoyl) adenosine (LCA-AMS), was successfully designed and synthesized to be used as a specific anti-mycobacterial agent. The acyl-CoA synthetases exhibited strong preferences for the length of side chain. FadD19 homologs, including FadD19 (MSMEG_5914), FadD19-2 (MSMEG_2241), and FadD19-4 (MSMEG_3687), are unanimously favorable cholesterol with a C8 alkanoate side chain. FadD17 (MSMEG_5908) and FadD1 (MSMEG_4952) showed high preferences for steroids, containing a C5 alkanoate side chain. FadD8 (MSMEG_1098) exhibited specific activity toward cholestenoate with a C8 alkanoate side chain. An acylsulfamoyl analogue of lithocholate, 5'-O-(lithocholoyl sulfamoyl) adenosine (LCA-AMS), was designed and synthesized. As expected, the intermediate analogue not only specifically inhibited those steroid-activated acyl-CoA synthetases, but also selectively inhibited the growth of mycobacterial species, including M. tuberculosis, M. smegmatis, and Mycobacterium neoaurum. Overall, our research advanced our understanding of mycobacterial steroid degradation and provided new insights to develop novel mechanism-based anti-mycobacterial agents.

All complexes show red phosphorescence in dichloromethane solution (lambda(em) approximate to 640 nm) with quantum yields in range of 4.3%-6.7% and phosphorescent lifetimes in range of 0.46-0.55 mu s in degassed dichloromethane solution. Among these complexes, the complex, Pt-12, with 12 carbons chain lengths shows columnar mesophase with liquid crystal temperature range of 22.0 degrees C to 77.8 degrees C, which was confirmed via polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The complex, Pt-12, exhibits ambipolar carrier transport behaviors, which has been confirmed by the space charge limited current (SCLC) measurement. Moreover, the carrier mobility in mesogenic state is two orders of magnitudes greater than that in the amorphous state, showing ordering packing in liquid crystalline phase can facilitate the charge transport.

We prove that the orthoferrites RFeO3 are mixtures of covalent and ionic bonds and have great capacity to resist the interior fracture and plastic deformation under the outside stress. In the assignment of the Raman spectra, the evolutionary relationship of lattice distortion, which is closely related to two soft mode frequencies, is quantified. We first report that the vibrational modes around 7.64 THz is sensitive to the radius of the rare earth and can prominently increase the vibration diversity of the center iron atom. Our results also demonstrate that not only the soft-mode frequencies but also the Born effective charges and dielectric constants are slightly sensitive to the atomic geometry. And this conclusion can be extended to the whole lanthanide system. We hope that our work can provide reference data for structural investigation and property measurements of the whole orthorhombic RFeO3 family.

However, little is known about the role of interactions among the soil aggregate, microbial communities, and nutrient traits in the soil restoration. In this study, we compared the effects of different restoration strategies on the formation of aggregates, the amount and distribution of soil nutrients, as well as the abundance and diversity of bacteria in a sandy soil of grassland at the Tibetan Plateau. The results demonstrated that both the grazing exclusion (GE: artificial planting and nutrient addition) and wise grazing (WG: artificial planting and nutrient addition with controlled grazing) treatments significantly increased the proportion of macroaggregates (4.0-and 5.2- times, p < 0.05) compared with the control. Increased soil organic carbon, total carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus were found in the aggregates of WG treatment, but not in the GE samples. In addition, WG significantly changed the bacterial composition and increased bacterial abundance in soil. This study evaluated WG as an efficient management for restoration of degraded sandy grassland in the Tibetan Plateau because it significantly enriched the soil nutrients, improved the soil structure, and increased bacterial abundance.

A Model for Basic Emotions Using Observations of Behavior in Drosophila	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						basic emotions; core affection; monoamine; evolution; instinct; emotion flow; Drosophila	IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; CIRCUMPLEX MODEL; SOCIAL-BEHAVIOR; MALE-AGGRESSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NATURAL KINDS; CORE AFFECT; DOPAMINE; OCTOPAMINE; CIRCUIT	Emotion plays a crucial role, both in general human experience and in psychiatric illnesses. Despite the importance of emotion, the relative lack of objective methodologies to scientifically studying emotional phenomena limits our current understanding and thereby calls for the development of novel methodologies, such us the study of illustrative animal models. Analysis of Drosophila and other insects has unlocked new opportunities to elucidate the behavioral phenotypes of fundamentally emotional phenomena. Here we propose an integrative model of basic emotions based on observations of this animal model. The basic emotions are internal states that are modulated by neuromodulators, and these internal states are externally expressed as certain stereotypical behaviors, such as instinct, which is proposed as ancient mechanisms of survival. There are four kinds of basic emotions: happiness, sadness, fear, and anger, which are differentially associated with three core affects: reward (happiness), punishment (sadness), and stress (fear and anger). These core affects are analogous to the three primary colors (red, yellow, and blue) in that they are combined in various proportions to result in more complex "higher order" emotions, such as love and aesthetic emotion. We refer to our proposed model of emotions as called the "Three Primary Color Model of Basic Emotions."

This work mainly combined a phenomenon that CdTe quantum dots (QDs) can be used to selectively differentiate free Hg2+ and the T-Hg2+-T complex, with the use of simple membrane filtration separation to improve the performance of the label-free bioassay methods. Upon hybridization with the DNA/protein (carcinoembryonic antigen, CEA) target, the T-Hg2+-T hairpin structure was opened and Hg2+ was released; this initiated the cation exchange reaction between Hg2+ and CdTe QDs which released Cd2+ simultaneously. Subsequently, the free Cd2+ was separated by the filtration membrane without separating the CdTe QDs, which could then be separated from the sample matrices for the CVG-AFS/ICP-MS assay. Under the optimal conditions, this method possessed high sensitivity for DNA and CEA determination with limits of detection (LODs) of 0.2 nM and 0.2 ng mL(-1), and linear dynamic ranges of 1-160 nM and 0.5-20 ng mL(-1), respectively, and exhibited excellent DNA sequence specificity and protein selectivity. This method preserves the advantages of the label-free atomic spectrometric bioassay, and combined with the selective cation exchange reaction and simple filtration separation to improve the performance.

Meanwhile, it is very important to study steelworks' low-carbon competitiveness (LCC) about low-carbon Production. Sampling some Chinese steelworks, this paper explored the LCC of steelworks. Through extensive review of literature, we constructed an evaluation index system of steelworks' LCC with 26 indicators in 5 dimensions from the perspective of carbon-intangible assets. In order to grasp the overall situation and development trend of steelworks' LCC, the TOPSIS method was modified in this study. Time dimension was incorporated to form a dynamic evaluation method used to evaluate and analyze the LCC of 12 Chinese steelworks. A major contribution of the study is the application of "vertical" and "horizontal" comparison of LCC in steelworks, which will help national governments to comprehensively understand the low-carbon level of enterprises, and helpful for managers to understand the development trend of LCC and take some targeted measures to enhance this parameter. In addition, this paper puts forward a new approach towards the research of dynamic evaluation method, which not only verifies the practicability and effectiveness of this method but also solves the problem of "vertical contrast" and realizes dynamic evaluation. Limitations of the study along with future research directions are also presented. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

In this work, we calculated the electronic structure, optical properties, and the thermal conductivity of the PtSSe monolayers, and performed a detailed comparison with other TMDs (monolayer PtS2 and PtSe2) using first-principles calculations. The calculated band gaps of the PtS2, PtSSe, and PtSe2 monolayers were 1.76, 1.38, and 1.21 eV, respectively, which are in good agreement with experimental data. At the same time, we observed a larger spin-orbit splitting in the electronic structure of PtSSe monolayers. The optical properties were also calculated and a significant red shift was observed from the PtS2 to PtSSe to PtSe2 monolayers. The lattice thermal conductivity of the PtSSe monolayer at room temperature (36.19 W/mK) is significantly lower than that of the PtS2 monolayer (54.25 W/mK) and higher than that of the PtSe2 monolayer (18.07 W/mK). Our results show that the PtSSe monolayer breaks structural symmetry and has the same ability to reduce the thermal conductivity as MoSSe and ZrSSe monolayers due to the shorter group velocity and the lower converged phonon scattering rate. These results may stimulate further studies on the electronic structure, optical properties, and thermal conductivity of the PtSSe monolayer in both experimental synthesis and theoretical efforts.

Electrochemical N-2 fixation is considered as an eco-friendly and sustainable process, but its efficiency depends greatly on the activity and stability of the catalyst used. Therefore, it is imperative to develop efficient electrocatalysts in the field of nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR). In this communication, we propose that structured polyaniline is an efficient metal-free NRR electrocatalyst in aqueous solution, achieving a NH3 yield rate of 5.45x10(-11) mol s(-1)cm(-2) and a Faradaic efficiency of 3.76% at -0.70 and -0.60 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode in 0.1 M HCl, respectively.

However, low rate capacity of the material greatly hampers the practical application due to its poor conductivity. Herein, La-doped Na3V2-xLax(PO4)(3)/C materials were prepared by a combination process of sol-gel and carbon-thermal reduction methods, All materials possess NASICON-type structure with the R (3) over barC space group. No impurity can be detected, and a thin carbon layer is coated on the surface of the materials. The doping of La3+ significantly reduces internal resistance and enhances fast Na4(+) mobility. As a result, the material with the addition of 2% La3+ exhibits excellent cyclic performance and rate capability: a high initial reversible capacity of 105.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C, capacity retentions of 96.5% at 1 C after 200 cycles, and excellent rate performance of 92.6 mA h g(-1) at 30 C. Under a high current density of 20 C for 3000 cycles, it can still deliver a superior reversible capacity of 73.5 mA h g(-1) with a high capacity retention of 93.5%. Even at 50 C, the Na3V1.98La0.02(PO4)(3)/C electrode can release a satisfactory initial capacity of 79.9 mA h g(-1) with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.3% after 8000 cycles. Our work demonstrates that La3+-doped Na3V2(PO4)(3)/C may be a promising candidate of cathode for high-performance sodium ion batteries.

The nucleation field goes up linearly with the interface anisotropy constants varying from -1 erg/cm(2) to 1 erg/cm(2) in a wide thickness range, with an amplitude up to 13%. The microscopic hysteresis loops, the evolution of the domain walls, the macroscopic demagnetization curves and the energy products are given by numerical calculations. The results indicate that the interface anisotropy affects not only the nucleation field and the maximal magnetic energy product, but also the pinning field or the coercivity. Positive interface anisotropy evidently enhances the pinning field or the coercivity, however, negative interface anisotropy obviously deteriorates the maximal energy product. These results suggest that a positive interface anisotropy should be preferred experimentally.	[Zhao, Q.; He, X. X.; Zhang, X. F.; Zhao, G. P.; Li, Z.

Herein, a series of rational wire-in-plate nanostructured CoFe LDH electrocatalysts grown on a Ni foam were developed via a one-step hydrothermal method. In this series of catalysts, Co4Fe2-LDHs/Co(OH)(2)-NWs exhibit excellent OER performance which is attributed to the most rational wire-in-plate nanostructure: the overpotentials of only 220 and 231 mV to drive current densities of 50 mA cm(-2) and 100 mA cm(-2), respectively, with a small Tafel slope of 51 mV dec(-1). Our study opens up a new horizon for the design of hierarchical structures with the coexistence of multidimensional nanounits for electrocatalysts.

The obtained materials were analyzed by several characterizations to get information on their chemical composition, crystalline structure, vibrational features and optical properties. The photocatalytic performance was evaluated by degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) and methylene blue (MB) under UV, visible and direct solar light irradiation. Its photocatalytic activity was enhanced depended on the novel structure of g-C3N4/TiO2 hybrid and the special Z-scheme electron-hole transfer model of multilayer heterointerfaces. The material preparation and structural features could be useful for the design and development of other photocatalysts with high photocatalytic activity.

In this paper, the neural network models are used to predict the properties of compounds based on Molecular Information. We predict the aqueous solubility of compounds, and evaluate the prediction results of the Neural Networks including CNN, RNN, DNN, SNN. The performance of the models in predicting the solubility is able to meet or exceed the predicted effect of the method based on the molecular structure (ESOL). DNN model performance is of more accuracy, and RNN performance is of better stability. This method can directly avoid complex molecular structure characterisation, and provide a convenient and flexible way to predict properties of compounds.

A carbon cage that can encapsulate TM atoms and isolate them from interacting with surface atoms is considered to protect the magnetic moments of the TM atoms. We have studied the magnetic moments of Fe, Co, and Ni atoms adsorbed inside the corner hole of Si(111)-(7 x 7) by using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. The results show that when Co and Ni atoms are directly adsorbed inside the corner hole, the magnetic moments are 1.353(B) and 0, respectively. However when a C-60 cage is used to encapsulate the atoms, the magnetic moments increase to 1.849(B) and 0.884(B), respectively. The results show a clear protecting effect of a carbon cage. For Fe with and without C-60, the magnetic moments are 2.909(B) and 2.825(B), respectively. The presence of a C-60 cage can also maintain their magnetic moments. Further analysis shows that the TM atoms possess magnetic moments when the conduction electrons are localized around them. All the results can be well understood in the framework of the Anderson impurity model. Our results demonstrate that a carbon cage may effectively protect the magnetic moments of TM atoms. This provides a new strategy for developing single atom spin-based devices on semiconductors.

Phylogenetically these individuals were placed in a clade with R. parvulus from Southeast Asia and pairwise genetic distances in DNA sequences of the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene ranged from 0 to 3.1% within the clade. Morphologically these specimens agree with R. parvulus in a series of characters including body size small, a large external vocal sac, vomerine teeth absent, snout slightly shorter than the diameter of the orbit, canthus rostralis indistinct, interorbital space broader than the upper eyelid, tympanum indistinct, fingers free, toes webbed at the base, an inner metatarsal tubercle, tibio-tarsal articulation reaches eye, small warts on the dorsal surfaces of body and limbs, throat smooth, belly granular, a dark triangular blotch between the eyes, a butterfly-like dark band on the back, a dark blotch on each side of lumbar region, and more or less distinct dark bars across limbs. Obvious intraspecific variation in the color pattern occurs within the population. It is possible that previous records of Raorchestes longchuanensis (Yang and Li, 1979) from southern Yunnan might be misidentification of R. parvulus.

Nitrate was preliminarily reduced into nitrite with low yield of ammonia by microscale Cu/Fe bimetal, and then the accumulated nitrite was converted into N-2 by sodium sulfite. Cu was uniformly dispersed on the surface of Fe by a simple displacement reaction. Role of major iron components and fate of nitrogen species were investigated. The selectivity for N-2 was over 90%, and the yield of ammonia was below 10%. In the system, accumulation of nitrite resulted from the lower reduction rate of nitrite by Fe2+ in solution and the Cu/Fe coated by oxidized iron layer compared with the generation rate of nitrite via the reduction of nitrate. The generation of ammonia was caused by the reduction of nitrate/nitrite by Fe2+ adsorbed on the surface of oxidized iron layer coated on the bimetal at low reaction rate.

Several important influencing factors are examined and illustrated. User information from the most recent posted microblog content of 3793 Sina Weibo users was collected. Natural language processing (NLP) was used for the sentiment and short text similarity analyses, and four machine learning techniques, i.e., logistic regression (LR), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) were compared on different rumor refuting microblogs; after which a valid and robust distinguishing XGBoost model was trained and validated to predict who would retweet disaster-related rumor refuting microblogs. Compared with traditional prediction variables that only access user information, the similarity and sentiment analyses of the most recent user microblog contents were found to significantly improve prediction precision and robustness. The number of user microblogs also proved to be a valuable reference for all samples during the prediction process. This prediction methodology could be possibly more useful for WeChat or Facebook as these have relatively stable closed-loop communication channels, which means that rumors are more likely to be refuted by acquaintances. Therefore, the methodology is going to be further optimized and validated on WeChat-like channels in the future. The novel rumor refuting approach presented in this research harnessed NLP for the user microblog content analysis and then used the analysis results of NLP as additional prediction variables to identify the anti-rumor spreaders. Therefore, compared to previous studies, this study presents a new and effective decision support for rumor countermeasures.

We find that seniors in the United States substantially outperform seniors in China, India, and Russia by 0.76-0.88 SDs and score comparably with seniors in elite institutions in these countries. Seniors in elite institutions in the United States further outperform seniors in elite institutions in China, India, and Russia by similar to 0.85 SDs. The skills advantage of the United States is not because it has a large proportion of high-scoring international students. Finally, males score consistently but only moderately higher (0.16-0.41 SDs) than females within all four countries.

Applying the law of probability decomposition, the renewal theory and the probability generating function technique, we explicitly derive the transient queue length distribution as well as the recursive expressions of the steady-state queue length distribution. Especially, some corresponding results under special cases are directly obtained. Furthermore, some numerical results are provided for illustrative purposes. Finally, a cost optimization problem is numerically analyzed under a given cost structure.

It is shown that the array laser beam with larger values f(s) and f(c) (when f(c) < 3) is less affected by the thermal blooming, and the array laser beam for CBC is more sensitive to the thermal blooming than that for IBC. For CBC the maximum intensity I-max is always larger than that for IBC, but for CBC the propagation efficiency J(PIB) is not always larger than that for IBC due to thermal blooming effect. Moreover, the optimal fill factors f(c) and f(s) for J(PIB) and I-max of array laser beams are also examined. The values of optimal fill factors needed to achieve the maximum of J(PIB) increase with increasing the beam power, but those needed to achieve the maximum of I-max are nearly independent of the beam power. In addition, the expression for the distortion parameter of array laser beams is also derived by using the analytical method, which is in agreement with numerical results.

However, structural stability and flexibility of enzymes restrict their applications in nonaqueous environments. It was proposed that nonaqueous media decrease the flexibility of enzymes, resulting in their reduced activity. There is little detailed information to clarify the impact of nonaqueous solvents on the structure and flexibility of enzymes at molecular level. In this work, by using the molecular dynamics simulation technology, we placed an entire transcription system in organic solvent to investigate the effects of nonpolar solvent on an enzyme. A small transcription machine, T7 RNA polymerase (T7 RNAP), was used as model enzyme to conduct this study. We constructed two models with the T7 RNAP complex solvated in organic solvent. The first one is to solvate the T7 RNAP complex in pure octane directly. Our observation shows that T7 RNAP suffers serious structural deterioration in octane, especially in the active site, that the original correct binding of the substrate was completely destroyed. The structural deterioration may seriously affect the activity of T7 RNAP. Another model was built by pulling the transcription system from water into octane. It was observed that a small portion of water with some ions was carried into the organic media and coated on the surface of the complex. The water layer forms a microaqueous solution environment that plays an important role in protecting the internal structure of the transcription system. However, the flexibility of some key residues was reduced in the simulation time. It is deduced that a higher temperature is necessary to improve its activity in nonaqueous solvents. Our results are in good agreement with those reported in the literature. It is expected that our research could provide valuable information for the application of enzymes in nonaqueous environments.

Using X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinement, Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectra, scanning electron microscope (SEM), differential thermal analysis (DTA), photoluminescence (PL) and vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM), the microstructures, luminescent and magnetic properties of the as-fabricated Eu-2(MoO4)(3) crystals have been investigated in detail. XRD, FT-IR and Rietveld refinement results show that the crystal structure of the final Eu-2(MoO4)(3) crystals can be remarkably influenced by the sintering temperature, exhibiting the phase transformation from tetragonal to monoclinic and then orthorhombic in the region of 600-1000 degrees C. SEM images manifest the sintering temperature has significantly influence on grain size and dispersity of the samples, although it has negligible effect on their morphology. DTA results confirm that the phase transition temperature for tetragonal to monoclinic and monoclinic to orthorhombic is 624 and 887 degrees C, respectively. PL results reveal that the excitation and emission intensities of the Eu-2(MoO4)(3) crystals initially increase and then decrease with increasing sintering temperature, given the maximum at 900 degrees C. VSM results indicate that all the as-fabricated Eu-2(MoO4)(3) crystals exhibit paramagnetic property. Our work can offer a simple and effective strategy to adjust the crystal structure of Eu-2(MoO4)(3) crystals.

Firstly, the process of the bi-directional choice between the drivers and the riders is described as a one-to-one two-sided matching problem. Next, prospect theory is used to characterize the psychological perceived behavior of both sides towards the matching scheme under the multiple criteria. Thus, the suitability function concerning the drivers and the acceptability function regarding the riders are naturally constructed. Following this, a two-sided matching decision model with two objectives is proposed. Finally, numerical experiments are presented to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed model. Besides, managerial insights associated with how to set the optimization objectives under unbalanced supply-demand in ridesharing companies are given. Increasingly, this paper aims to not only validate the proposed methodology, but also to highlight the importance and urge of incorporating sustainability into the task distribution problem in ridesharing.
