CuI-NEt3 catalyzed alkyne azide cycloaddition in toluene at room temperature connected two triphenylene discogens to a biphenyl rod-shaped mesogen. The trimers were characterized by using H-1 NMR, IR, and high resolution mass spectrometry. The mesomorphic properties were investigated using polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction. The results showed that the trimers exhibited rectangular columnar mesophase (Col(r)). The length of the flexible spacer connecting the three segments has prominent influence on the phase transition temperatures of the trimers.

The influence of the types of initiator, reation time and reaction temperature on the yield of DAPAs were investigated. The products were characterized by NMR and MS. By using DHPA, DTMPPA and DDPA (10% in kerosene) as extractants, the extraction of Co2+ and Ni2+ in sulphate medium at different equilibrium pH values were measured. The results show that the maximum yield of DHPA, DTMPPA and DDPA can all be achieved at about 130 degrees C under the initiation of di- tert-butyl peroxide (DTBP). All the extraction of cobalt with respect to DHPA, DDPA and DTMPPA precedes that of nickel. The difference in pH(1/2) value (defined as the pH at which 50% metal extraction occurs) between cobalt and nickel increases in the following sequence from large to small: DHPA, DDPA and DTMPPA, which indicates that the separation ability for cobalt and nickel ascends from DHPA, DDPA to DTMPPA.

The geometries of the reactants, transition states, intermediates and products were optimized at the B3LYP/6-311G* level. Vibration analysis was carried out to confirm the transition state structure, and the intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) method was performed to search the reaction path. In addition, atoms in molecules (AIM) theories were used to discuss bond natures. The reaction in water solution was investigated at the same level with SCRF(PCM) method. Reaction pathways were investigated in this study. The result indicates that the reaction Re -> TS1 -> IM1 -> TS2 -> IM2 -> TS3 -> IM3 -> TS4 -> IM5 -> TS7 -> IM9 -> TS13 -> IM10 -> TS14 -> P3 is the main pathway, the activation energy of which is the lowest. The dominant product predicted theoretically is in agreement with the experiment results.

Demagnetization process and hysteresis loops in perpendicularly oriented hard/soft trilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETIZATION REVERSAL; DOMAIN-WALLS; MAGNETS; NANOLAYERS	Nucleation and evolution of domain walls as well as the magnetic reversal process in perpendicularly oriented hard/soft trilayers have been investigated within a micromagnetic approach, concentrated on the situation with very thin hard layer. The formula for the nucleation field has been derived, which falls as the soft layer thickness rises. Negative nucleation field occurs at thick soft layer when the shape anisotropy surpasses the crystalline one, where the magnetization in the center of the soft layer obeys the coherent rotation model. The microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops have been calculated numerically, with the angular distribution of the magnetization between the nucleation and pinning fields obtained. The area of the hysteresis loop decreases while the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning as the soft layer thickness increases. The effect of the hard layer thickness is contrary to that of the soft layer, however, the former affects the demagnetization process and hysteresis loops significantly only when the layers are thin enough.

All the stationary points on the doublet, quartet, and sextet potential energy surfaces (PES) have been fully optimized. The reaction undergoes preferentially on the quartet PES. The whole reaction can be divided into two stages. In the stage 1, the complex is oxidized by H2O2 through an O-O bond homolytic cleavage pathway and the intermediate IM6 and the first H2O molecule are formed. In the stage 2, the IM6 is reduced by the second H2O2 molecule via two hydrogen abstraction steps and O-2 and the second H2O are formed. The rate-determining step was found to be the O-O bond breaking step with a barrier of 63.9 kJ.mol(-1). The calculated barrier for the O-O homolytic cleavage in dismutation of free H2O2 is 226.7 kJ.mol(-1). The results indicate that the [Fe(III)TMTAA] complex can decrease energy barrier of the titled reaction and it may be a potential candidate for catalase mimic.

The present author holds that this text has both self-reference of metafiction and the reference to exterior hisrory and reality, and that the former has not not only weakened but also strengthened the latter. Employing the metafiction technique of exposing its own fictionality, the novel gives prominence to the fictionality and narrativity of history in the process of telling history as a story, and discloses the narrative logic and ideology in the "objective", "real" history text; furthermore, it reveals how the history and the real world are fictionalized according to discourse hegemony. As a historiographic metafiction, the novel no longer self-refers, self-indulges or disengages itself from history and reality as radical metafiction. It refers to the operation of the discourse of social power and the ideological dialogue under the cover of self-consciousness.

The auxiliary principle technique is applied to study the existence and an iterative algorithm of solutions for the system of generalized set-valued mixed variational-like inequality problems. At first, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the auxiliary problems for (SGSMVLIP) is shown. Next, an iterative algorithm for solving (SGSMVLIP) is constructed by using the existence and uniqueness result. Finally, we prove the existence of solutions of (SGSMVLIP) and discuss the convergence analysis of the algorithm. These results improve, unify and generalize many corresponding known results given in the literature. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The physical characteristics of the Li4Ti5O12/C composite were investigated by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy techniques. The particle size of Li4Ti5O12 in the composite was about 200 nm. The electrochemical properties were evaluated by electrochemical impedance spectra and constant current charge/discharge cycling. It was demonstrated that the as-prepared Li4Ti5O12/C composite presented excellent high-rate characteristics and cycleabilities. The initial specific capacity of the composite was 130.0 mA h g(-1) at 8.60 mA cm(-2), and excellent cycle performance was still maintained with the current density increase. Moreover, it was proved that the electric conductivity and cycle performance of Li4Ti5O12 were effectively enhanced due to the uniformly dispersed pyrolytic carbon in the Li4Ti5O12 particles.

It is shown that the M-2-factor of GSM array beams depends on the beam number, the relative beam separation distance, the beam coherence parameter, the type of beam superposition, and the strength of turbulence. The turbulence results in an increase of the M-2-factor. However, for the superposition of the intensity the M-2-factor is less sensitive to turbulence than that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function. The M-2-factor of GSM array beams is larger than that of the corresponding Gaussian array beams. However, the M-2-factor of GSM array beams is less affected by turbulence than that of the corresponding Gaussian array beams. For the superposition of the cross-spectral density function a minimum of the M-2-factor of GSM array beams may appear in turbulence, which is even smaller than that of the corresponding single GSM beams.

Hack in Southwest China revealed by ISSR	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						P. paniceum (Lam.) Hack.; ISSR; genetic diversity; southwest China	MARKERS; POPULATIONS	Inter-simple sequence repeats markers were used to estimate the genetic diversity of Pogonatherum paniceum (Lam.) Hack. from Sichuan Province, Yunnan Province, Chongqing City and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in China. 100 primers were carried out on 22 wild populations, 14 could produce highly reproducible inter-simple sequence repeats markers bands. Out of the 239 discernable DNA fragments, 227 were polymorphic. The percentage of polymorphic bands was 94.98% at the species level. Nei's gene diversity and Shannon information index were 0.312 and 0.471, respectively. This indicated that the genetic diversity of P. paniceum (Lam.) Hack. was low. The values of genetic identity ranged from 0.548 to 0.820 with a mean of 0.673. Nei's genetic distance between 22 populations ranged from 0.198 to 0.601. Unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean cluster analysis based on Nei's genetic distance showed that most populations were positioned into the relevant areas. Significant correlation between genetic and geographic altitude distances among populations was found by Mantel test. The high score of percentage of polymorphic bands might be caused by low frequent polymorphism distributed in different populations.

The curve of volume dependence of energy indicates the energy of ST(AA)structure is lower than that of pyrite structure. According to our result and the experimental criterion raised by Pugh, we come to the conclusion that the PtN2 is a very hard and fragile material. But when the pressure increases, the PtN2 becomes malleable gradually. It is revealed that the pyrite structure of the PtN2 is a semiconductor and the STAA structure of the PtN2 is a conductor by analyzing their density of states and band structure.

Our results indicate that at on-axis positions, Laguerre Gaussian beams with zero angular mode number will have less scintillations than fundamental Gaussian beams, where the amount of scintillations will further decrease with rising radial mode number. When off-axis positions are considered, this situation reverses however, and the scintillations of Laguerre Gaussian beams become generally higher than the fundamental Gaussian beam. Plotted against the source size, the on-axis scintillations of Laguerre Gaussian beams fall below the fundamental Gaussian beam, following the same trend as the fundamental Gaussian beam all throughout the source size range examined.

The current study investigated body dissatisfaction, engagement in body change behaviors, and sociocultural pressures on body image, and the relationships between these variables among 517 adolescent males (N = 219) and females (N = 298) in China. Females reported greater body dissatisfaction than males, and males reported using strategies to increase their muscle bulk more often than females. Males reported pressure from a variety of sociocultural sources to increase their muscles or weight, while females reported pressure from the media to lose weight. For males body dissatisfaction was predicted by pressure from peers to increase their muscle bulk, while for females pressure to lose weight from peers, adult relatives, and the media was likely to increase body dissatisfaction. Pressure from the media and adult relatives was also predictive of body change behaviors in both males and females. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research in both Western and non-Western contexts. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

On the one hand, by proving a compactness lemma and solving a variational problem, the existence of the standing wave with ground state for the aforementioned equation is proved. On the other hand, the authors derive the instability of the standing wave by applying the potential well argument, the concavity method and an invariant region under the solution flow of the Cauchy problem for the equation under study, and the invariance of the region aforementioned can be shown by introducing an auxiliary functional and a supplementary constrained variational problem.

We prove that the dead core rate is faster than the one given by the corresponding ODE, which is contrary to the known results for the related extinction, quenching and blow up problems. Moreover, we find the dead core rate is quite unstable: the ODE rate can be recovered if the absorption term is replaced by -a(t, x)u(p) for a suitable bounded, uniformly positive function a(t, x). As an application of the above results, some new and relatively simple examples of fast blow up are provided, and a phenomenon of strong sensitivity to gradient perturbations is exhibited.

Dielectric and piezoelectric properties of (Bi1-x-yNdxNa1-y)(0.5)BayTiO3 lead-free ceramics	CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						Lead-free; Dielectric; Piezoelectric; Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3	TRANSITION	New lead-free (Bi1-x-yNdxNa1-y)(0.5)BayTiO3 ceramics were prepared by a conventional ceramic technique and their dielectric and piezoelectric properties were studied. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that Nd3+ and Ba2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure, and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < y < 0.10. The partial substitutions of Nd3+ and Ba2+ decrease effectively the coercive field E-c and increase significantly the remanent polarization P-r. Because of lower E-c, larger P-r and the formation of the MPB, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are significantly enhanced at x/y = 0.02/0.06: d(33) = 150 pC/N and k(p) = 30.5%. The ceramics exhibit relaxor characteristic, which is probably resulted from the cation disordering in the 12-fold coordination sites. The depolarization temperature T-d shows a strong compositional dependence and reaches a minimum value at the MPB. The temperature dependences of the ferroelectric and dielectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions near the depolarization temperature T-d, which cause the polarization hysteresis loop become deformed near/above T-d.

Local clustering feature refers to the phenomenon whereby one group of data is separated from another, and the data from these different groups are clustered locally. A compact class is defined as one cluster in which all similar elements cluster tightly within the cluster. Herein, the essence of the local clustering feature, revealed by mathematical manipulation, results in a novel clustering algorithm termed as the special local clustering (SLC) algorithm that was used to process gene microarray data related to Alzheimer's disease (AD). SLC algorithm was able to group together genes with similar expression patterns and identify significantly varied gene expression values as isolated points. If a gene belongs to a compact class in control data and appears as an isolated point in incipient, moderate and/or severe AD gene microarray data, this gene is possibly associated with AD. Application of a clustering algorithm in disease-associated gene identification such as in AD is rarely reported.

A morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < y < 0.10. As compared to pure Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 ceramic, the partial substitutions of Y3+ for Bi3+ and Ba2+ for (Bi0.5Na0.5)(2+) in the A-sites of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lower effectively the coercive field E (c) and increase the remanent polarization P (r) of the ceramics. Because of low E (c), large P (r) and the MPB, the ceramics with x = 0-0.02 and y = 0.06 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 155-159 pC/N and k (p) = 28.8-36.7%. The temperature dependences of dielectric properties of the ceramics show relaxor-like behaviors. The ferroelectric properties at different temperature suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions near/above T (d).

It is shown that turbulence results in a decrease of the effective radius of curvature. However, the effective radius of curvature of partially coherent HG beams with smaller beam coherence parameters and larger beam order is less sensitive to turbulence. In addition, when the beam coherence parameter increases, the effective radius of curvature increases or decreases, depending on the strength of turbulence.

Simulation results, which are consistent to the experimental data, show that PEI-5 with four methylene units in each alkyl side chain has higher T(g) (glass transition temperature) and higher tensile strength, but lower tensile elongation at break than those of PEI-6 with five and PEI-8 with seven methylene units in each alkyl side chain. However, unlike the traditional phenomena, conformational analysis provides that PEI-5 with the highest T(g) gives the highest flexibility to the polymer chain, whereas PEI-8 with the lowest T(g) imparts the lowest flexibility resulting from attachment of longer alkyl side chain increase the rigidity of backbone. From the calculated ratio of the accessible volume to the total volume for each system, the highest ratio of PEI-8 indicates that long alkyl side chains generate more free volume than short side chains, acting as an internal plasticizer in bulk structure. It is the internal plasticizing effect that is predominantly responsible for the abnormal properties, instead of the rigidity from side chains. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

X-ray diffraction patterns reveal that a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) of rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.10 < x < 0.20, 0 < y < 0.04, and 0.01 < z < 0.03. After the partial substitutions of (Bi0.5K0.5)2+, Ba2+, and Sr2+ for the A site (Bi0.5Na0.5)2+ ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3, the coercive field E-c decreases greatly and the remnent polarization P-r increases significantly. Because of the MPB, lower E-c and higher P-r, the piezoelectricity of the ceramics is greatly improved. For the ceramics with x=0.15, y=0.02, and z=0.015, the piezoelectric properties become optimum, giving d(33)=203 pC/N, k(p)=31.4%, and k(t)=46.7%. The depolarization temperature T-d reaches a minimum value at the MPB. Our results also suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and nonpolar regions near T-d, which causes the polarization hysteresis loop to become deformed and the ceramics to become depolarized.

In this work, we propose two extensions of DS-FP to minimize the on-line scheduling overhead. The proposed algorithms produce a hyperperiod from DS-FP so that the schedule generated by repeating the hyperperiod infinitely satisfies the temporal validity constraint of the real-time data. The first algorithm, named DEferrable Scheduling with Hyperperiod by Schedule Construction (DESH-SC), searches the DS-FP schedule for a hyperperiod. The second algorithm, named DEferrable Scheduling with Hyperperiod by Schedule Adjustment (DESH-SA), adjusts the DS-FP schedule in an interval to form a hyperperiod. Our experimental results demonstrate that while both DESH-SC and DESH-SA can reduce the scheduling overhead of DS-FP, DESH-SA outperforms DESH-SC by accommodating significantly more update transactions in the system. Moreover, DESH-SA can also achieve near-optimal update workload.

Turbulence distance of radial Gaussian Schell-model array beams	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION CHARACTERISTICS; LASER	The effect of turbulence on the spreading of radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beams is studied quantitatively by examining the mean-squared beam width. The analytical expression for the turbulence distance z (T) of radial GSM array beams is derived by using the integral transform technique, which indicates within what ranges radial GSM array beams will be less affected by turbulence. It is shown that the effect of turbulence on the spreading of radial GSM array beams can be reduced by choosing the suitable array beam parameters and the type of the beam superposition. In addition, a comparison with the previous work is also made.	[Li, X.; Ji, X.] Sichuan Normal Univ, Dept Phys, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Eyyuboglu, H.

It finds that under a certain condition different types of partially coherent beams may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam in free space and also in atmospheric turbulence if the angular spread is chosen as the characteristic parameter of beam directionality. On the other hand, it shows that generally, the directionality of partially coherent beams expressed in terms of the angular spread is not consistent with that in terms of the normalized far-field average intensity distribution in free space, but the consistency can be achieved due to turbulence.

We analyze the transmission probabilty of this system in both the equilibrium and nonequilibrium cases, and our results reveal that the transport properties show some noticeable characteristics depending upon the spin-polarized strength p, the magnetic flux Phi and the number of lattice sites N-R in the mesoscopic ring.

In this study, we performed quantitative analysis by confocal microscopy assay for evaluation of HER2 expression in individual tumor cells. HER2 testing by confocal microscopy assay exhibited high concordance with results of real-time PCR, Western blot analysis and FISH analysis. We found that there was a significant positive correlation between HER2 overexpression and gene amplification in individual CTCs, which provided validation of confocal microscopy assay for HER2 expression in CTCs. By using subsets of 10 consecutive cells (bins), we conclude that HER2 expression (3+) in CTCs predicts HER2 overexpression of tumor with high probability in breast cancer patients. These results may provide interpretive guidelines for HER2 status assay in CTCs and raise great opportunities for using CTCs as non-invasive and 'real-time' biopsy to examine and monitor the status of tumor markers.

The influences of synthetic conditions such as polymerization temperature, the amount of initiator (AIBN) and the property of template on the morphologies and diameter sizes of MIPMs were investigated in details. The results indicated that the morphologies of MIPMs were evidently affected by the polymerization temperature and the amount of AIBN. The diameters of MIPMs were decreased with increasing the polymerization temperature but increased with increasing the amount of AIBN, while the influences of template on the diameters of microspheres are not visible. The resultant MIPMs was characterized by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM), IR analysis, BET adsorption test and Scatchard analysis as well as the controlled release test in mimetic gastric juice (pH = 1). The IR analyses proved that the polymerization effects really occurred. The BET adsorption test indicated that the adsorption amount of MIPMs to LMD was as three times as that of non-imprinted microspheres (NIPMs). The controlled release test indicated that the release ratio of LMD on NIPMs was linearly increased with increasing time, which suggests that the release process is completely controlled by diffusion. Meanwhile, the release ratio of LMD on MIPMs was curvedly increased with increasing time, which indicates that the release process is controlled by both diffusion and the imprinting effect. And the release time was prolonged. The results indicate that the MIPMs released the LMD for 10 h while the NIPMs for only 5 h in the mimetic gastric juice. Therefore, the resultant MIPMs of LMD looks forward to being used as the materials for DDS.

J	Ji, XL				Ji Xiao-Ling			Influence of atmospheric turbulence on the spreading and directionality of radial Gaussian array beams	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						radial Gaussian array beam; atmospheric turbulence; coherent and incoherent combinations; mean-squared beam width	PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; OFF-AXIS SUPERPOSITION; SCHELL-MODEL BEAMS; LASER ARRAYS; FAR-FIELD; PROPAGATION	The analytical expressions for the mean-squared beam width and the far-field divergence angle of radial Gaussian array beams in atmospheric turbulence are derived. The influence of turbulence on the spreading and directionality is studied in detail. It is shown that for the coherent combination, the radial Gaussian array beams with smaller beam number N and larger radial radius r(0) are less affected by the turbulence. The spreading of radial Gaussian array beams for the coherent combination is smaller than that for the incoherent case. However, the spreading of radial Gaussian array beams for the coherent combination is more affected by turbulence than that for the incoherent case. Specially, the mean-squared beam width in the far-field for the coherent combination is the same as that for the incoherent case when N is small enough or r(0) is large enough. On the other hand, the condition under which radial Gaussian array beams for both coherent and incoherent combinations have the same farfield divergence angle as a single Gaussian beam is also given. The main results are interpreted physically.

Here, we investigated the antitumor activity of periplocin against lung cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo, and explored its anti-cancer mechanism. Periplocin inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells and induced their apoptosis in time-and dose-dependent manners by cell cycle arrest in G0/G1 phase. Periplocin exhibited anti-tumor activity both in human (A549) and mouse (LL/2) lung cancer xenograft models. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that intratumoral angiogenesis was significantly suppressed. Furthermore, anti-cancer activity mediated by periplocin was associated with decreased level of phosphorylated AKT and ERK both in vitro and in vivo, which were important for cell growth and survival. Moreover, periplocin induced apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-2 and upregulating Bax, leading to activation of caspase-3 and caspase-9. These findings suggested that periplocin could inhibit the growth of lung cancer both in vitro and in vivo, which could be attributed to the inhibition of proliferation and the induction of apoptosis signaling pathway, such as AKT and ERK. These observations provide further evidence on the anti-tumor effect of periplocin, and it may be of importance to further explore its potential role as a therapeutic agent for cancer.

The adsorption energies, equilibrium geometries and vibration frequencies of CH3OH on nine types of sites on the Pt-Mo(111)/C surface were predicted and the favorite adsorption site for methanol is the top-Pt site. Both sites of valence and conduction bands of doped system have been broadened, which are favorable for electrons to transfer to the cavity. The possible decomposition pathway was investigated with transition state searching and the calculation results indicate that the O-H bond is first broken, and then the methanol decomposes into methoxy. The activation barrier of O-H bond breaking with Pt Mo catalyst is only 104.8 kJ mol(-1), showing that carbon supported Pt Mo alloys have promoted the decomposition of methanol. Comparing with the adsorption energies of CH3OH on the Pt(111)/C surface and that of CO, the adsorption energies of CO are higher, and Pt(111)/C is liable to be oxidized and loses the activity, which suggests that the catalyst Pt Mo(111)/C is in favor of decomposing methanol and has better anti-poisoning ability than Pt(111)/C.

Selenium (Se)-enriched yeast has probably been the most widely investigated food supplement and the literature on Se speciation in the Se-enriched yeast is fairly abundant, however, the strategy for Se speciation commonly requires complicated pretreatment procedures such as digestion and stepwise extraction. The present study was carried out to apply X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) for the direct speciation of Se species with minimal pretreatment steps. By comparison of the XAS spectra of Se-enriched yeast samples with that of the standard Se species, organic R-Se-R (represented by selenomethionine) was found to be the main chemical form of Se. Quantitative speciation through principal component analysis (PCA) and least-squares linear combination (LC) fitting the Se-enriched yeast samples found 83%, 85% and 81% of R-Se-R (probably selenomethionine which is known to exist in yeast) for SelenoPrecise (R) yeast, SelenoPrecise (R) tablets, and Xiweir (R) tablets, respectively, which is in agreement with those from HPLC-ICP-MS analysis. More broadly, XAS can also be applied to other Se-enriched products with the merit of minimal pretreatment. However since XAS, specifically XANES, can only identify the chemical type rather than specific molecules, other methods like HPLC-ICP-MS are necessary to give not only the coordination environment of Se but also the identity of the Se species.

The supramolecular network of asym-TTT facilitates the formation of the directional-oriented molecular arrays of zinc phthalocyanines (ZnPc). The high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopic (STM) images as well as the density-functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the preferential adsorption of ZnPc dimers in the anisotropic rearrangement of an asym-TTT supramolecular network. The self-repairing process of the molecular arrays after sweeping ZnPc dimers further confirms the anisotropic reconstruction of the asym-TTT network. The controlled experiments on the symmetrically substituted compound indicate the impact of the asymmetrically substituted carboxyl groups on the supramolecular networks.

Hybrid battery capacitors LAC/Li4Ti5O12 and DMLAC/Li4Ti5O12 were then assembled. The effects of the content of LiFePO4 and the preparation method on the cyclic voltammograms, the rate of charge discharge and the cycle performance of the hybrid battery capacitors were investigated. The results showed the overall electrochemical performance of the hybrid battery capacitors was the best when the content of LiFePO4 in the composite cathode materials was in the range from 11.8 to 28.5 wt. %, while the preparation method had almost no impact on the electrochemical performance of the composite cathodes and hybrid battery-capacitors. Moreover, the hybrid battery capacitor devices had a good cycle life performance at high rates. After 1000 cycles, the capacity loss of the DMLAC/Li4Ti5O12 hybrid battery capacitor device at 4C was no more than 4.8 %. Moreover, the capacity loss would be no more than 9.6 % after 2000 cycles at 8C.

The truxene discogens HTn (n = 4-8, 10, 12) were characterised by using 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance, and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Their thermal stability was studied with thermal gravimetric analysis and their liquid crystal properties were investigated by using polarising optical microscopy, differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction.

J	Liao, ZW; Hu, SX; Chen, WF				Liao, Zhiwu; Hu, Shaoxiang; Chen, Wufan			Determining Neighborhoods of Image Pixels Automatically for Adaptive Image Denoising Using Nonlinear Time Series Analysis	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							SHRINKAGE	This paper presents a method determining neighborhoods of the image pixels automatically in adaptive denoising. The neighborhood is named stationary neighborhood (SN). In this method, the noisy image is considered as an observation of a nonlinear time series (NTS). Image denoising must recover the true state of the NTS from the observation. At first, the false neighbors (FNs) in a neighborhood for each pixel are removed according to the context. After moving the FNs, we obtain an SN, where the NTS is stationary and the real state can be estimated using the theory of stationary time series (STS). Since each SN of an image pixel consists of elements with similar context and nearby locations, the method proposed in this paper can not only adaptively find neighbors and determine size of the SN according to the characteristics of a pixel, but also be able to denoise while effectively preserving edges. Finally, in order to show the superiority of this algorithm, we compare this method with the existing universal denoising algorithms. Copyright (C) 2010 Zhiwu Liao et al.

The positive charge mobility was observed to be in the order of 10(-5) similar to 10(-4) cm(2) V-1 s(-1). Though the thermal stability of Colh mesophase is higher than that of 2, the carrier mobility of 1 is smaller by one order of magnitude probably due to the presence of an electrical dipole of the carbonyl group. Also the temperature dependence of mobility in 1 exhabits a thermally activation behavior in a stronger way than in 2, indicating the hydrogen bond interaction affect the thermal behavior of charge hopping by a modification of molecular dynamics.

Here, we consider the quantum transport along the one-dimensional electron structures driven by time-dependent external fields, typical the open mesoscopic rings threaded by time-periodic magnetic fluxes. Based on the well-known Floquet theorem we effectively separate the time and space variables in the transport equations. As a consequence, the time-dependence behaviors can be characterized by the so-called Floquet energies and the usual quantum waveguide theory (only involving with elastic scatterings) could be generalized to treat the situations with various inelastic scatterings between different Floquet energy sidebands. Our numerical results show clearly that, due to the interaction between the electrons and the applied oscillating fields (i.e., time-dependent fluxes), transmission resonances can be induced by means of photon emissions and absorptions. The influence of the amplitude of the additional static magnetic flux on these photon-assisted tunnelings are also investigated. (C) 2009 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The lattice constants and electronic band structure are found consistent with the available experimental and theoretical values. The pressure of the wurtzite-to-rocksalt structural transition is 13.4 GPa, which is in an excellent agreement with the most recent experimental values. The optical characteristics reproduce the experimental data thus justifying the feasibility of our theoretical predictions of the optical properties of InN at high pressures.

The complexes have the general formula ppyPt(O boolean AND O), where ppy is 2-phenylpyridyl, and O boolean AND O is beta-diketonate ancillary ligands with the acyl substituent group in position 3 of (D)-(+)-camphor. Although, like the many Pt(II) complexes with square-planar geometry, these complexes have plane stacking modes in crystal structure, the sterically bulky camphor-derived groups compel extensive slipping of the molecular stacking planes, resulting in the negligible overlapping of the aromatic ring fragments between molecules and the considerable Pt-Pt distance. The resolved spectra and a little shifted emission in solid state of complexes show that there is significant reduction of pi-pi interactions and Pt-Pt interactions, and suggest these complexes may be good candidates for doped phosphorescent organic light emitting diodes (PhOLEDs) and even for nondoped PhOLEDs.
