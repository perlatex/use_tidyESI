J	Liu, K; Wang, SM; Zhou, XL; Chang, J				Liu, Ke; Wang, Shan-Min; Zhou, Xiao-Lin; Chang, Jing			Theoretical calculations for structural, elastic, and thermodynamic properties of c-W3N4 under high pressure	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							1ST-PRINCIPLES CALCULATIONS; LATTICE-VIBRATIONS; CONSTANTS; MINERALS; NITRIDE; SILICATES; SOLIDS; APPROXIMATION; TRANSITION; PLATINUM	We have investigated the structural and elastic properties of c-W3N4 at high pressures using generalized gradient approximation within the plane-wave pseudopotential density functional theory. The obtained normalized volume dependence of the resulting pressure is in excellent agreement with our experimental data investigated using high-P synchrotron x-ray diffraction. The elastic constants as a function of the applied pressure, the bulk modulus, Young's modulus and shear modulus on the pressure P are also successfully obtained. The superior mechanical properties indicate that c-W3N4 is a potential candidate structure to be one of the ultra-incompressible and hard materials. The high-pressure elastic constants indicate that c-W3N4 is mechanically stable up to 50GPa. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that c-W3N4 is not stable above 110GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that c-W3N4 possesses ductile nature in the range of pressure from 0 to 50GPa. The calculated elastic anisotropic factors suggest that c-W3N4 is elastically anisotropic. Through the quasi-harmonic Debye model, we also investigate the thermodynamic properties of c-W3N4.

J	Zhang, DG; Ting, CS				Zhang, Degang; Ting, C. S.			Proposed detection of time-reversal symmetry in topological surface states	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SINGLE DIRAC CONE; INSULATORS; BI2TE3	By employing the T-matrix approach, we investigate a nonmagnetic impurity located on the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators, where the time-reversal symmetry is preserved. It is shown that the images of the local density of states (LDOS) around the single impurity have dip-hump structures with six-fold symmetry at different bias voltages. The peaks are produced by quasiparticle interference, while the local minima at the backscattering wave vectors are due to the absence of backscatterings. With increasing the bias voltage, the peaks and dips move forward to the location of the impurity. These dips at the backscattering wave vectors in the LDOS spectra can be regarded as a signature of the time-reversal symmetry in the topological surface states, which can be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy.

Growth occurred with 0-3% (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum pH 7.2) and at 40-60 degrees C (optimum 50 degrees C). The main respiratory quinone was MK-7. The predominant polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and diphosphatidylglycerol. The major fatty acids were iso-C-15:0 and anteiso-C-15:0. The DNA G+C content was 46.6 mol%. The phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain S9Z-7(T) should be assigned to the genus Bacillus and was related most closely to Bacillus drentensis LMG 21831(T) (sequence similarity 97.2%). The result of the DNA DNA hybridization experiment revealed a low relatedness (27.2%) between the isolate and B. drentensis LMG 21831(T). The results of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and genotypic analyses clearly indicated that strain SgZ-7(T). represents a novel species, for which the name Bacillus thermocopriae sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-7(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012030(T)=KACC 16700(T)).

This study proposes an alternative approach for obtaining optimized impurity structures using molecular dynamics calculation in conjunction with the superposition model. This new approach is specifically applied to a system named alpha-Al2O3:Yb3+, in which the simulated defect structure is used to fit the superposition model parameters directly onto the observed energy levels. Such an approach provides predicted values of crystal-field parameters, Zeeman splitting g-factor, and hyperfine structure constants. Moreover, the C-3v site symmetry is found to be a good approximation for the actual C-3 site of Yb3+, as doped in an alpha-Al2O3 crystal.

Under some suitable conditions, relations between Levitin-Polyak well-posedness and Hadamard well-posedness of a general mixed variational inequality are studied. We also establish some characterizations of Hadamard well-posedness for a genaral mixed variational inequality. Finally, we derive some conditions under which a general mixed variational inequality is Hadamard well-posed.

Confirmatory factor analyses (CFAs) were conducted on data collected from 700 Chinese mothers and 700 Chinese fathers, and 385 Malay parents of children aged 6-12 years. The CFA results suggested that the model was a good fit for both the Chinese and Malaysian responses. Furthermore, invariance testing showed that although there was factor loading invariance across cultures, the assumption of intercept invariance did not hold. This suggests that although the scale is suitable for use in both cultures, mean comparisons across contexts could be problematic. The internal reliabilities for the Typical and Malicious cruelty subscales were adequate across the samples. All findings show that the CABTA is a promising scale for international use.

The influence of the bandwidth Omega of spectrum, the beam decentered parameter beta, and the fractal constant alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum on the beam spreading is examined in detail. It is found that polychromatic laser beams are less sensitive to turbulence than monochromatic ones, and decentered laser beams are less sensitive to turbulence than centered ones. The larger the Omega and beta are, the larger the beam spreading is in free space, but the less the beam spreading is affected by turbulence. In turbulence laser beams with different values of beta will have the same directionality if the angular spread is chosen as the characteristic parameter of beam directionality, which is quite different from the behavior in free space. The beam spreading is largest and the influence of turbulence on the beam spreading is also largest when alpha is in a region about 3.1. In addition, the dependence of the turbulence distance on Omega and beta is also investigated, and some interesting results are obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is demonstrated that by employing a maximally entangled (respectively, nonmaximally entangled) four-particle cluster state as the quantum channel, quantum information initially and generally (respectively, specially) distributed in three spatially separated qubits can be remotely and probabilistically concentrated back to a single qubit without performing any global operations. Moreover, the total success probabilities of these two protocols are also worked out. It is more easier to realize experimentally by POVM than by projective measurement.

Here we disclose that the use of plant pholyphenol as amphiphilic large molecule ligand/stabilizer allows for the preparation of noble metal complex and noble metal nanoparticle catalysts. These catalysts are found to be highly selective and active in aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis of cinnamaldehyde and quinoline, and can be reused at least 3 times without significant loss of activity. Moreover, the catalytic activity and reusability of the catalysts can be rationally controlled by simply adjusting the content of polyphenols in the catalysts. Our strategy may be extended to design a wide range of aqueous-organic biphasic catalysis system.

By the nonequilibrium Green's function theory, we calculate the linear conductance of the system, which possesses a different Fano structure both in the parallel and anti-parallel configuration of the FM leads. The results come from the quantum interference between resonant and nonresonant processes in the system. Our studies indicate that the system is an ideal platform to investigate the Fano physics, even in some relevant experiments. (C) 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.

We used genome-wide RGA markers for genetic analyses of structure and diversity in a global rice germplasm collection. Of the 472 RGA markers, 138 were polymorphic and these were applied to 178 entries selected from the USDA rice core collection. Results from the RGA markers were similar between two methods, UPGMA and STRUCTURE. Additionally, the results from RGA markers in our study were agreeable with those previously reported from SSR markers, including cluster of ancestral classification, genetic diversity estimates, genetic relatedness, and cluster of geographic origins. These results suggest that RGA markers are applicable for analyses of genetic structure and diversity in rice. However, unlike SSR markers, the RGA markers failed to differentiate temperate japonica, tropical japonica, and aromatic subgroups. The restricted way for developing RGA markers from the cDNA sequence might limit the polymorphism of RGA markers in the genome, thus limiting the discriminatory power in comparison with SSR markers. Genetic differentiation obtained using RGA markers may be useful for defining genetic diversity of a suite of random R genes in plants, as many studies show a differentiation of resistance to a wide array of pathogens. They could also help to characterize the genetic structure and geographic distribution in crops, including rice, wheat, barley, and banana.

Growth occurred with 0-1 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum 1%) and at pH 5.5-8.5 (optimum pH 7.2) and at 25-37 degrees C (optimum 30 degrees C) in nutrient broth (NB). The strain had the ability to grow under anaerobic conditions via the oxidation of various organic compounds coupled to the reduction of anthraquione-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS). Chemotaxonomic characteristics (main ubiquinone Q-10, major fatty acid C-18:1 omega 7c/C-18:1 omega 6c and DNA G+C content 67.7 mol%) were similar to those of members of the genus Azospirillum. According to the results of phylogenetic analyses, strain SgZ-5(T) belonged to the genus Azospirillum within the family Rhodospirillaceae of the class Alphaproteobacteria, and was related most closely to the type strains of Azospirillum lipoferum, Azospirillum thiophilum and Azospirillum oryzae (98.0, 97.6 and 97.1 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity, respectively). DNA DNA pairing studies showed that the unidentified organism displayed reassociation values of 36.7 +/- 3.7, 24.1 +/- 2.2 and 22.3 +/- 2.4 % to the type strains of A. lipoferum, A. thiophilum and A. oryzae, respectively. Similarities between nifH gene sequences of strain SgZ-5(T) and members of the genus Azospirillum ranged from 94.0 to 97.0%. A combination of phenotypic, chemotaxonomic, phylogenetic and genotypic data clearly indicated that strain SgZ-5(T) represents a novel species, for which the name Azospirillum humicireducens sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is SgZ-5(T) (=CCTCC AB 2012021(T)=KACC 16605(T)).

The influences of the beam decentred parameter beta, the fractal constant alpha of the atmospheric power spectrum, and the bandwidth Omega of spectrum on propagation property are studied. It is shown that the larger the value of beta, the bigger the deviation of centre of beam gravity from the propagation axiis, and the more unsymmetrical the coherence degree is. However, the on-axis spectrum is nearly independent of beta. The influence of alpha on total intensity, on-axis spectrum and coherence degree is non-monotonic. When alpha = 3.1, the propagation properties are most affected by turbulence. It is mentioned that at certain propagation distances, the shifts of on-axis spectrum are the same for different values of alpha. Furthermore, the on-axis spectral shift disappears at other propagation distances which are independent of Omega, and these propagation distances decrease due to turbulence. The results obtained in this paper will be useful for the applications of polychromatic partially coherent decentred laser beams propagating in non-Kolmogorov turbulence.

The phytase gene (phyC) of B. subtilis GYPB04 was cloned into the plasmid pMG36e for expression in Lactococcus lactis. The enzyme activity in L lactis cultured in GM17 broth was 20.25 U/mL at 36 degrees C. The expressed phytase was characterized as active in a pH range of 2.0-9.0 at a temperature range of 20-80 degrees C, with an optimum pH of 5.5-6.5 and temperature of 60 degrees C. When cultured in food-grade milk broth, the transformed L lactis grew to an OD600 nm value of 1.05 and had a phytase yield of 13.58 U/mL. In same broth under optimized conditions for cell growth and phytase production, the transformant reached an OD600 nm value of 1.68 and a phytase yield of 42.12 U/mL, representing approximately 1.6-fold and 3.1-fold increases, respectively, compared to growth in natural milk broth. Fermentation was scaled to 5 L under optimized conditions, and product analysis revealed a final OD600 (nm) value of 1.89 and an extracellular enzyme activity of 24.23 U/mL. The results of this study may be used in the dairy fermentation industry for the development of functional, healthy yogurts and other fermented dairy foods that provide both active phytase and viable probiotics to the consumer.

We first consider the situation of two sender and demonstrate a flexible deterministic joint remote state preparation compared with previous probabilistic schemes. And then generalize the protocol to multi-sender and show that by only adding some classical communication the success probability of preparation can be increased to four times. Finally, using a proper positive operator-valued measure instead of usual projective measurement, we present a new scheme via two non-maximally entangled states. It is shown that our schemes are generalizations of the usual standard joint remote state preparation scheme and more suitable for real experiments with requirements of only Pauli operations.

J	He, B; Li, W				He, Bing; Li, Wei			Efficient Production of androstadienedione and testolactone from progesterone by biotransformation using Fusarium solani	RESEARCH JOURNAL OF BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Androstadienedione; testolactone; progesterone; Fusarium solani 14-2; biotransformation	BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERPLASIA; ASPERGILLUS-TAMARII-KITA; MCCUNE-ALBRIGHT SYNDROME; AROMATASE INHIBITORS; PRECOCIOUS PUBERTY; MICROBIAL TRANSFORMATION; LACTONIZATION PATHWAY; THERAPY; SERIES; GIRLS	This study describes the efficient production of androstadienedione (androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione, ADD) and testolactone (1-dehydrotestololactone) from progesterone by biotransformation using the filamentous fungus Fusarium solani 14-2. These two metabolites produced in high yield were purified and were characterized on the basis of spectroscopic features ((HNMR)-H-1, C-13 NMR, IR and TOF-MS). The effects of some process conditions, like the pH value, concentration of substrate, solubilizing agents have been investigated. When tween-80 was used to solubilized progesterone with concentration of 10g/L, the substrate was completely consumed at 120 h and the yield of ADD reached its maximum at 120 h with concentration of 8.355 g/L and testolactone reached its maximum at 240 h with concentration of 8.682 g/L. The conversion rate of progesterone to androstadienedione and testolactone was not affected by progesterone concentration below 10 g/L. The optimum pH value for the bioconversion was 5.8. The results obtained in this study indicate that the strain of Fusarium solani 14-2 has the ability to convert a high concentration of progesterone to produce androstadienedione and testolactone in high yield and indicating its potential for commercial production of testolactone or ADD.

The magnetic fields induce some nonlocal effects in these nonlinear Schrodinger systems, and the main goal of this paper is to understand these effects. The key is to establish some a priori estimates on the nonlocal terms generated by the magnetic field, through which we obtain various conclusions including finite time blow-ups, sharp threshold of global existence and instability of standing waves for these equations.

A K0.5Na0.5NbO3-based solid solution with perovskite structure is formed after the addition of Bi-0.5(Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3 to K0.5Na0.5NbO3. A small amount of Bi-0.5(Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3 retards the grain growth, induces a diffuse phase transition at T-C, decreases Curie temperature and weakens the ferroelectricity of the ceramics. The ferroelectric orthorhombic-ferroelectric tetragonal phase at TO-T is shifted to low temperature after the addition of (Na0.7K0.2Li0.1)(0.5)TiO3, leading to the formation of the coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases near room temperature at 0.015 < x < 0.035. Because of the more possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of the two phases, enhanced piezoelectric properties are obtained in the ceramics situated near the coexistence zone of two phases. The ceramic with x=0.030 possesses the relatively high T-C of 372 degrees C and large d(33) of 183 pC/N. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Eyyuboglu, HT; Ji, XL				Eyyuboglu, Halil Tanyer; Ji, Xiaoling			Radius of curvature of Bessel and modified Bessel Gaussian beams	OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Radius of curvature; Bessel Gaussian and modified Bessel Gaussian beams; Random phase screen; Turbulent atmosphere	ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; VORTEX BEAMS; PROPAGATION; MOMENTS	We analyze the radius of curvature of Bessel Gaussian (BG) and modified Bessel Gaussian (mBG) beams. The study is based on the results of analytic derivation as well as those of the random phase screen approach. Our results are displayed in graphs as variations of radius of curvature against propagation distance at various settings of beam order, width parameter, source focal length, wavelength, refractive index structure constant. Our findings indicate that mBG beams, in general will have larger radius of curvature values than BG beams. It is further observed that increases in beam order will lead to greater radius of curvatures. Rises in the width parameter will reveal more the differentiations between BG and mBG beams. At small focal lengths, the difference between BG and mBG beams is hardly noticeable. Higher wavelengths will initially cause a reduction in the radius of curvature, but at longer propagation distances, the reverse will happen. Increases in the refractive index structure constant will lead to smaller radius of curvature values. A general agreement is found in comparing the analytic results of BG beams with those of phase screen approach. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Upon co-doping with transition metal (TM) and carbon, the calculated results show a shift in the Fermi level and a remarkable change in the covalency of ZnO. Such cases energetically favor ferromagnetic semiconductor with high Curie temperature due to p-d exchange interaction between TM ions and holes induced by C doping. The total energy difference between the ferromagnetic and the antiferromagnetic configurations, spatial charge and spin density, which determine the magnetic ordering, were calculated in co-doped systems for further analysis of magnetic properties. It was also discovered that optical properties in the higher energy region remain relatively unchanged while those at the low energy region are changed after the co-doping. These changes of optical properties are qualitatively explained based on the calculated electronic structure. The validity of our calculation in comparison with other theoretical predictions will further motivate the experimental investigation of (TM, C) co-doped ZnO diluted magnetic semiconductors.

A maintenance policy (N-1,N) based on the number of failures of the service machine is introduced into the system. Assuming that a failed service machine after repair will not be as good as new', and the spare service machine for replacement is only available by an order. More specifically, we suppose that the procurement lead time for delivering the spare service machine follows a phase-type (PH) distribution. Under such assumptions, we apply the matrix-analytic method to develop the steady state probabilities of the system, and then we obtain some system performance measures. Finally, employing an important Lemma, the explicit expression of the long-run average cost rate for the service machine is derived, and the direct search method is also implemented to determine the optimal value of N for minimising the average cost rate.

Firstly, we establish a global existence-uniqueness lemma for the SFDEs under the global Lipschitz condition in a", without the linear growth condition. Then, under the local Lipschitz condition in a",, we show that the non-continuable solution of SFDEs still exists if the drift coefficient and diffusion coefficient are square-integrable with respect to t when the state variable equals zero. And the solution of the considered equation must either explode at the end of the maximum existing interval or exist globally. Furthermore, some more general sufficient conditions for the global existence-uniqueness are obtained. Our conditions obtained in this paper are much weaker than some existing results. For example, we need neither the linear growth condition nor the continuous condition on the time t. Two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

The performances of various exchange-correlation functionals and basis sets used in the polarizability calculations for these non-bonded systems were carefully examined. M06-2X and CAM-B3LYP produce results similar with those at MP2 level. The total polarizability of methane hydrates is about the sum of those of methane and empty water cages. However, this does not mean a simple summation rule for the polarizability of methane hydrates. Further analysis reveals a reduced polarizability of encapsulated CH4 and an enhanced polarizability of water cage. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Three candidate structures of known transition-metal diborides are chosen to probe. The calculated lattice parameters, elastic properties, Poisson's ratio, and B/G ratio are derived. It is observed that the ReB2-type structure containing well-defined zigzag covalent chains exhibits an unusual incompressibility along the c axis comparable to that of diamond. Formation enthalpy calculations demonstrate that the ground-state phase is synthesizable at low pressure, whereas the other phase can be achieved through the phase transformation. Moreover, according to Mulliken overlap population analysis, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with a partial metallic bond is presented. The predicted hardness of WB2-WB2, ReB2-ReB2, and OsB2-OsB2 is in reasonable agreement with experiment data. Both strong covalency and a zigzag topology of interconnected bonds underlie the ultraincompressibilities. In addition, the superior performance and largest hardness of ReB2-ReB2 indicate that it is a superhard material. This work provides a useful guide for designing novel borides materials having excellent mechanical performances.

This paper presents a kernelized version of a quantile estimator integrated with coefficient-based regularization, which can be solved efficiently by a simple linear programming. Fast convergence rates are obtained under mild condition on the underlying distribution. Besides, this algorithm can be adapted easily to large scale problems and sparse solution is often achieved as that of Lasso. In our work we make the following main contributions: girst, improved learning rates are obtained by employing so called variance bounds, which is optimal in the literatures of learning theory; second, we establish stronger convergence rates by employing self-calibration inequalities; third, our learning rates can also be derived by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method; finally, the performance of the classical and our new algorithms are compared respectively in a simulation study and an actual problem.

J	Ma, Y; Ji, XL				Ma Yuan; Ji Xiao-Ling			Average intensity of tilted and off-axis Gaussian Schell-model beams propagating through a cat-eye optical lens in atmospheric turbulence	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						cat-eye optical lens; atmospheric turbulence; partially coherent beam; intensity	LASER; RETROREFLECTOR; DESIGN; CAVITY	The influences of atmospheric turbulence and the beam coherence on the average intensity of tilted and off-axis laser beams propagating through a cat-eye optical lens in the turbulence are studied. It is shown that the oscillatory behavior and the skewness of average intensity may appear because there exist apertures and active detection laser beams are tilted or off-axis. The skewness is independent of turbulence, but the oscillatory behavior disappears due to turbulence. For a small positive defocus of a cat-eye optical lens, the on-axis average intensity reaches its maximum. The a positive defocus value becomes small as the focal length of the cat-eye optical lens decreases, but it is independent of atmospheric turbulence and the coherence of active detection laser beams. And the average intensity becomes an off-Gaussian-like profile when the propagation distance is large enough in turbulence. However, less beam spreading may occur with increasing propagation distance for active detection laser beams with less coherence, which is quite different from the behavior of laser beams propagating in free space. The better the coherence of active detection laser beams is, the more the average intensity is affected by the turbulence, but the difference is small. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for the applications is active laser detection.

J	Peng, JY; Mo, ZW				Peng Jia-Yin; Mo Zhi-Wen			Several teleportation schemes of an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state via different quantum channels	CHINESE PHYSICS B			English	Article						quantum information; quantum teleportation; quantum state sharing; multi-particle state	PARTIALLY ENTANGLED STATE; ORTHOGONAL COMPLETE SET; PROBABILISTIC TELEPORTATION; TRANSFORMATION OPERATOR; ONE-PARTICLE; W-STATE; EXPANSION; AGENTS	We first provide four new schemes for two-party quantum teleportation of an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state by using three-, four-, and five-particle states as the quantum channel, respectively. The successful probability and fidelity of the four schemes reach 1. In the first two schemes, the receiver can only apply one of the unitary transformations to reconstruct the original state, making it easier for these two schemes to be directly realized. In the third and fourth schemes, the sender can preform Bell-state measurements instead of multipartite entanglement measurements of the existing similar schemes, which makes real experiments more suitable. It is found that the last three schemes may become tripartite controlled teleportation schemes of teleporting an arbitrary multi-particle state after a simple modification. Finally, we present a new scheme for three-party sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state. In this scheme, the sender first shares three three-particle GHZ states with two agents. After setting up the secure quantum channel, an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state can be perfectly teleported if the sender performs three Bell-state measurements, and either of two receivers operates an appropriate unitary transformation to obtain the original state with the help of other receiver's three single-particle measurements. The successful probability and fidelity of this scheme also reach 1. It is demonstrated that this scheme can be generalized easily to the case of sharing an arbitrary unknown multi-particle state among several agents.

A computational model of visual attention was developed for solving the problem, inspired by the behavior and the neuronal architecture of human visual attention. Firstly, the global feature was extracted from input image by law's rules, then local features were extracted and evaluated with an improved saliency map model of Itti. The local features were fused into a single topographical saliency map by a multi-feature fusion operator differenced from Itti model, in which the better feature has the higher weighting coefficient and more contribution to fusion of the feature's images. Finally, the regions were "popped out" in the map. Experimental results show that the model can locate regions of interest and exclude the most background regions.

Using the probability decomposition theory and renewal process, two variants on this model, namely the late arrival system with delayed access (LAS-DA) and early arrival system (EAS), have been examined. For both the cases, recursive solution for queue length distributions at arbitrary, just before a potential arrival, pre-arrival, immediately after potential departure, and outside observer's observation epochs are obtained. Further, various performance measures such as potential blocking probability, turned-on period, turned-off period, vacation period, expected length of the turned-on circle period, average queue length and sojourn time, etc. have been presented. It is hoped that the results obtained in this paper may provide useful information to designers of telecommunication systems, practitioners, and others. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Both tree and one-loop diagrams for the processes are evaluated. In addition to their decay rates and dilepton invariant mass distributions, we focus on the forward-back asymmetries in these modes. Our calculation shows that the forward-backward asymmetries in h -> gamma e(+)e(-) and h -> gamma mu(+)mu(-) could be up to 10(-2) while in the tau(+)tau(-) final state, these asymmetries are below 1%. Thus the forward-backward asymmetries in h -> gamma l(+)l(-) might be interesting observables in the future precise experiments both to test our understanding of Higgs physics in the standard model and to probe the novel Higgs dynamics in new physics scenarios.

It is found that the prominent peaks of the dielectric functions and the refractive index significantly shift towards lower energies in the order of Al --> Ga --> In, and these compounds are characterized by similar optical spectra with some anisotropy effects. Present findings predict that CuGaTe2 and CuInTe2 are promising for photovoltaics due to their high absorption of solar radiations and photoconductivity in the visible range. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

The progress of synthetic organic chemistry and new molecular designing ideas will result in improved discotic liquid crystalline semiconductors. In this report, we have investigated the CuI-Et3N catalyzed click reaction between terminal alkyne and azide, both of which contain a triphenylene moiety. Series new mono-dispersed triphenylene discotic liquid crystal oligomers containing the 1,4-disubstituted-1,2,3-triazole ring have been synthesized. Their structures have been fully characterized by FT-IR, H-1 and C-13 NMR spectroscopy, MALDI Mass spectrometry. The monodispersity of oligomers has been confirmed by the result of GPC. Their thermal stability and liquid crystalline properties have been studied by thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results demonstrated that all oligomers possessed the hexagonal columnar mesophase, and were room temperature liquid crystals.

With proper values of the relative phase, the transient absorption can be eliminated, and the high refractive index without absorption can be achieved. It is shown that amplitude of the microwave field is also important factor that can result in different gain and dispersion behaviors of the probe.

Due to its extremely harsh environment, the Tibetan Plateau breeds possibly abundant, extreme microorganisms. In this research, 67 phytate-degrading bacteria were isolated from different habitats in the Tibetan Plateau. Among all isolates, 40.3% were screened from farmland, 25.3% from wetland, 4.5% from saline-alkaline soil, 7.5% from hot springs, and 22.4% from lawns, which showed that the distribution of the phytate-degrading bacteria varied with habitats. By the PCR-RFLP method, 16 different species were identified and named, 4 of which are reported for the first time as phytate-degrading bacteria, that is, Uncultured Enterococcus sp. GYPB01, Bacillaceae bacterium strain GYPB05, Endophytic bacterium strain GYPB16, and Shigella dysenteria strain GYPB22. Through the assay of phytase activity of 16 strains, Klebsiella sp. strain GYPB15 displayed the highest capability of phytase production. Through analysis of the optimum pH, the optimum temperature, and the thermal stability of enzyme from 16 strains, some especial phytate-degrading bacteria were obtained. Our findings clearly indicate a good relation between the composition of the soils from the different environments in the Tibetan Plateau and populations of cultivable phytate-degrading bacteria. Moreover, extreme harsh soils are logically the best soils in which to find some strains of phytate-degrading bacteria for exploiting in the fields of biotechnology and industry.

In this article, we provide a sequential rank-based nonparametric adaptive EWMA (NAE) control chart for detecting the persistent shift in the location parameter. This NAE chart is a self-starting scheme and thus can be used to monitor processes at the start-up stages rather than waiting for the accumulation of sufficiently large calibration samples. Moreover, we do not require any prior knowledge of the underlying distribution, and to prespecify any tuning parameter either. A Markov chain model is suggested to calibrate the run-length distribution of NAE, which is shown to have approximate tail probability as a geometric distribution. A simulation study demonstrates that the proposed control chart not only performs robustly for different distributions, but also is efficient in detecting various magnitude of shifts. A real-data example from manufacturing shows that it performs quite well in practical applications.

The results show that, the forward random laser pumping exhibits larger averaged gain and gain fluctuation while the backward random laser pumping has lower averaged gain and nonlinear impairment under the same signal input power and on-off gain. The effective noise figure (ENF) of the forward random laser pumping is lower than that of the bi-directional 1st-order pumping by similar to 2.3dB, and lower than that of bi-directional 2nd-order pumping by similar to 1.3dB at transparency transmission, respectively. The results also show that the spectra and power of RFL are uniquely insensitive to environmental temperature variation, unlike all the other lasers. Therefore, random-lasing-based distributed fiber-optic amplification could offer low-noise and stable DRA for long-distance transmission.

Among them, the mechanism of the high pressure structural phase transition has been studied in a detailed manner. Our results show that the structural phase transition pressure from MnP- to CuTi-structure in NiSi is 14.6GPa, which is in good agreement with other theoretical report. We have also calculated the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's coefficients, and elastic anisotropy factors of MnP-type NiSi under high pressure. We find that the pressure has an important influence on the elastic modulus. Moreover, on the basis of the Mulliken overlap population analysis, the hardness H (H=11.3GPa) of the MnP-type NiSi has been obtained, which is compatible with the experimental value.

In this paper, we assume that the retailer will provide a full trade credit to his/her good credit customers and request his/her bad credit customers pay for the items as soon as receiving them. Under this assumption, we model the retailer's inventory system as a cost minimization problem to determine the retailer's optimal inventory cycle time and optimal payment time under the replenishment rate is finite. Then, an algorithm is established to obtain the optimal strategy. Finally, numerical examples are given to illustrate the theoretical results and obtain some managerial phenomena.

We study the global well-posedness, finite time blowup and asymptotic behavior of this problem. By Hamiltonian property, we establish two types of invariant evolution flows. Then from one flow and the stability of classical energy-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation, we find that the solution exists globally and scattering occurs.

Then it is proved that the content of a realizable fuzzy relation is equal to the chromatic number of a simple graph generated by the realizable fuzzy relation. Therefore, many existing algorithms (including exact and heuristic algorithms) developed to find the chromatic number or to get an upper bound on chromatic number of a graph can be applied to solve the calculating problem of the content of a realizable fuzzy relation.

By using the total probability decomposition technique, we study the transient and equilibrium properties of the queue length from the beginning of the arbitrary initial state, and obtain both the recursion expressions of the z-transformation of the transient queue length distribution and the recursion expressions of the steady state queue length distribution at arbitrary time epoch n(+). The results obtained in this paper indicate that the queue length distribution in equilibrium no longer follows the stochastic decomposition discipline. The important relations between the steady state queue length distributions at different time epochs (n(-), n, n(+)) are discovered. Finally, by numerical examples, we discuss the sensitivity of the steady state queue length distribution towards system parameters, and illustrate the application of the expressions for the steady state queue length distribution in the system capacity design.

The repairman may mean here the human beings who are used to repair the failed device. When the device functions smoothly, the repairman leaves the system for a vacation, the duration of which is an exponentially distributed random variable. In vacation period, the repairman can perform other secondary jobs to make some extra profits for the system. The lifetimes and the repair times of the device are governed by phase-type distributions (PH distributions), and the condition of device following repair is not "as good as new". After a prefixed number of repairs, the device is replaced by a new and identical one. The spare device for replacement is available only by an order and the procurement lead time for delivering the spare device also follows a PH distribution. Under these assumptions, the vector-valued Markov process governing the system is constructed, and several important performance measures are studied in transient and stationary regimes. Furthermore, employing the standard results in renewal reward process, the explicit expression of the long-run average profit rate for the system is derived. Meanwhile, the optimal maintenance policy is also numerically determined. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to decrease or avoid the shortage during the teleportation process based on probabilistic channel, we propose a new scheme to reconstruct a deterministic teleportation eight-qubit channel using Bell-state measurements based on the probabilistic channel, which replaces high-dimensional unitary operations. In our scheme, a new quantum channel without alterable parameters replaces the general quantum channel with parameters as probabilistic teleportation. It shows that if we choose an eight-qubit probabilistic channel to construct deterministic channel, the relevant parameters of the eight-qubit probabilistic channel can be avoided. Thus, in quantum teleportation process, quantum channel can be chosen as a deterministic channel. This shows that our scheme makes real experiments more suitable.

The equation of state of monoclinic CdP4 has also been evaluated by synchrotron-radiation angle-dispersive X-ray diffraction (ADXRD) under quasihydrostatic compression up to 26.4 GPa in a diamond-anvil cell. The ADXRD data yield a bulk modulus B-0 = 94 +/- 9 GPa with a pressure derivative B-0' = 8.0. The experimental data are discussed and compared to the results of first-principles calculations.

In the scheme, the sender Alice distributes a quantum secret with a Bell-state measurement and publishes her measurement outcomes via a classical channel to three agents who are divided into two grades. One agent is in the upper grade while other two agents are in the lower grade. Then introducing an ancillary qubit, the agent of the upper grade only needs the assistance of any one of the other two agents for probabilistically getting the secret, while an agent of the lower grade needs the help of all the other two agents by implementing a controlled-NOT operation and a proper positive operator-valued measurement instead of usual projective measurement. In other words, the agents of two different grades have different authorities to reconstruct Alice's secret by a probabilistic manner. Moreover, the total success probability and the maximum success probability of the scheme are also worked out.

With increasing the ratio of solvophilic to block length to solvophobic block length(R-H/T), solvophobic sphere, ordered hexagonal phase, onion phase, perforated onion phase and flocculent phase are formed, respectively. Since onion phase has potential application in controlled drug release, it has received wide attention experimentally and theoretically. Our simulation indicates onion phase forms at a certain R-H/T(close to but less than 1). A star-block copolymer molecule has two conformations in onion phase: either fully located in a shell or shared by two neighboring shells. Central structure affects onion's final shape. The molecular number of the copolymer in each shell is a quadratic function of the shell's radius. The arm number of star-block copolymer has little influence on onion's structure, but slightly affects the solvent content. Additionally, we studied the influence of arm length on onion's structure.

The method to derive higher-order intensity moments in atmospheric turbulence is proposed, and the simple expressions for intensity moments up to the fourth-order are derived. The results obtained in this paper are general, which can reduce to higher-order intensity moments of an arbitrary optical beam propagating in both free space and turbulence. Taking the Gaussian beam for example, the propagation of the kurtosis parameter in atmospheric turbulence is studied. It is shown that the kurtosis parameter of Gaussian beams is not a propagation invariant in atmospheric turbulence, which depends on propagation distance, waist width, inner and outer scales of turbulence and refraction index structure constant. This result is different from that obtained by using the quadratic approximation of Rytov's phase structure function or the strong fluctuation condition of turbulence. The reasonable explanations for the differences are given in this paper.

The results indicate that imaginary part decreases with frequency increasing, and tetrahedral structure of H2O and hydrogen bond of aqueous NaCl solution is broken by high temperature, leading to the decreasing of real part of dielectric. The loss angle tangent in solution obviously decreases in a low frequency zone at 353 K compared with that in pure water. Temperature window effect that complex dielectric increases or decreases with temperature varying at 2.45 GHz and 5.8 GHz, thereby leading to the oscillation of dissipation power in microwave heating process and the nonequilibrium distribution of temperature is also confirmed.

Due to the covalent effect, the doped Fe and Co atoms preferentially occupy the A sites. It causes that some MnA (-2.1 mu B) atoms become MnD (3.2 mu B) and a local ferromagnetic structure of MnB-CoC-MnD is generated in the ferrimagnetic matrix, showing that an increment of molecular moment is as high as 6.18 mu B. The achievement of the ferromagnetic structure consumes the exchange interaction energy, consequently, reducing the T-C in Fe doping alloys. It is found that the toleration for doping Co in Mn2CoAl reaches up to x = 0.64, much more than that in Mn2CoGa (x = 0.36), and the change from ordered B2 to A2 structures along with the decrease of Al content. These observations reveal the importance of the covalent effect in these intermetallic compounds. The Cr doping shows an abnormal increment of molecular moment of 3.65 mu B and increases the T-C rapidly, which implies that Cr atoms may take an atomic configuration thereby disobeying to the occupation rule.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure. The ceramics have an orthorhombic symmetry at x <= 0.05 and transform gradually to a tetragonal structure with x increasing. A morphotropic phase boundary is formed at 0.05 < x < 0.125. A small amount of Ba-0.6(Bi0.5K0.5)(0.4)TiO3 (x >= 0.025) transforms NaNbO3 from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric and strong ferroelectricity is observed in the ceramics with x = 0.05-0.175. The ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes diffusive with x increasing. High mechanical quality factor Q(m) values of 1211-1862 are obtained at x = 0.05-0.075. Due to the MPB and the weakened stability of ferroelectric domain induced by the decrease in the T-c, the ceramics with x = 0.10-0.175 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d(33) = 105-131pC/N and k(p) = 20.8-26.5%.

The obtained data were mainly used to explore origins of the observed optical-transparency loss and behaviors of the refractive-index change for MgO under relatively strong shock compression. Results show that the V-0(+2)-induced heterogeneous absorption within similar to 300-700 nm should be a source causing the transparency loss. It is found that the refractive index of perfect MgO at 532 nm increases with shock pressure. The V-0(+2) leads to a rise in refractive index, and the increment increases with shock pressure. If the vacancy concentration increases with shock pressure, effects of the V-0(+2) on refractive index are enhanced further. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, L.; Tang, M.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure, indicating that La ions are incorporated into Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 lattices to form a lead-free solid solution. The ceramics are transformed from coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases to pseudocubic phase with the doping level of La increasing. After the doping of La, grain growth is inhibited, ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition temperature (T (C)) is decreased and the degree of diffuse phase transition is increased. The ferroelectricity of the ceramics is weakened after the addition of La. Unlike donor-doped lead zirconate titanate ceramics, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are degraded after the partial substitution of La3+ for (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(2+) because of the weakness or disappearance of coexistence of orthorhombic and tetragonal phases near room temperature. The (Ba0.85Ca0.15)(1-x)La2/3xTi0.90Zr0.10O3 + 1 mol% MnO2 ceramic with x = 0 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 277 pC/N and k (p) = 30.3 %, respectively.

The Boss Alice wants to distribute a quantum secret to seven distant agents who are divided into two grades. Three agents are in the upper grade and four agents are in the lower grade. Every agent of the upper grade only needs the collaboration of three of the other six agents to get the secret, but all the agents of the lower grade need the collaboration of all the other six agents. In other words, different agents in different grades have different authorities to recover Boss' secret. And the agent in upper grade is more powerful than the one in the lower grades which needs more information to recover the secret.

The initial state is setup by coating an amphiphilc solution with a layer of water, which prevents the formation of crossing periodic configuration. The influence of the concentration of the amphiphilc solution is investigated. At low concentration, amphiphilic molecules aggregate into a lot of micelles and small vesicles. With the increase of amphiphilc concentration, vesicles with simple and complex structures are formed. A new vesicle formation pathway, which is slightly different from the classic vesicle formation pathway, is observed in current simulation condition. Vesicle is formed by the union of many large micelles directly instead of by bilayer-vesicle transition. At high concentration, complex vesicles with multichamber structures are formed. These chambers are separated by bilayer membranes and filled with solvent particles. The volume of complex vesicle as well as its chamber number is increasing with the initial concentration. Present simulation results are in well agreement with experimental result.

The addition of 0.25 mol% MnO2 promotes grain growth, improves the ferroelectricity of the ceramics and strengthens ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C. Because of the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases and the combinatory effects of soft and hard doping of Mn ions, the ceramic with x = 0.25 exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties (d(33) = 306 pC/N and k(p) = 42.2 %, respectively). Excess MnO2 inhibits the grain growth and degrades the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. Sintering temperature has an important influence on the microstructure, tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C, ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The increase in sintering temperature leads to large grains and more noticeable tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition near 40 degrees C, enhances ferroelectricity and thus improves effectively the piezoelectricity of the ceramics. The Ba0.85Ca0.15Ti0.90Zr0.10O3 ceramic sintered at 1350 degrees C possesses the optimum piezoelectric constant d(33) value of 373 pC/N.

Nine college students from a Chinese university participated in the wiki-mediated collaborative writing project. Analyses of data from the wiki Discussion, Page, and History modules on each group tab revealed that the three small groups displayed three distinct patterns of online interaction: collectively contributing/mutually supportive, authoritative/responsive, and dominant/withdrawn. These patterns were substantiated by the roles group members assumed and members task approaches in terms of equality and mutuality. Also, findings from semi-structured interviews suggested that the different patterns of interaction influenced the students perceived learning experiences. The collectively contributing/mutually supportive group reported themost learning opportunities. This study not only fills a gap in current collaborative writing literature but also makes a theoretical contribution to research on computer-mediated interaction in collaborative learning. Pedagogical implications on how to conduct computer-mediated collaborative writing are also addressed.

Calculated lattice parameters, elastic constants and theoretical Vickers hardness are in excellent agreement with available experimental and theoretical results. The transition pressure from NaCl to CsCl phase is determined with values of 5.695 Mbar for TiC and 3.482 Mbar for TiN. Pressure-induced effects on mechanical properties of NaCl-type TiC and TiN show that the Vickers hardness increases first, to a maximum value 43.65 and 27.48GPa at the pressure of 2.1 and 0.9 Mbar for NaCl-type TiC and TiN, respectively, and then decreases with increasing pressure.

Our calculations are based on the full potential linear augmented plane wave (FP-LAPW) plus local orbitals method, together with generalized gradient approximation for the exchange-correlation potential. Half-metallic (HM) ferromagnetism is observed in these binary compounds for their optimized cell volumes. In the HM state, these compounds possess an integer magnetic moment (1.000 mu(B)) per formula unit, which is one of the important characteristics of half-metallic ferromagnets (HMFs). The ferromagnetic (FM) state is found to be stable for ZB TcC, TcSi and TcGe against the nonmagnetic (NM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) states. Calculations show that half-metallicity can be maintained for a wide range of lattice constants in these binary compounds. Density functional calculations of exchange interactions and the Curie temperatures reveal similar trends for the three compounds with respect to the lattice parameter. These compounds are compatible with the traditional semiconductors, and could be useful in spinelectronics and other applications. The most important aspect of this work is to explore the possibility of not only magnetism, but HM ferromagnetism in compounds involving NM elements and 4d transition element Tc.

It is proved in this note that a domain R is a G-Dedekind domain if and only if every ideal of R is Gorenstein-projective (G-projective for short).

The changes of the intensity distribution, the centroid position and the mean-squared beam width of an Airy beam propagating through the atmosphere are studied by using the four-dimensional (4D) computer code of the time-dependent propagation of Airy beams through the atmosphere. It is shown that an Airy beam can't retain its shape and the structure when the Airy beam propagates through the atmosphere due to thermal blooming except for the short propagation distance, or the short time, or the low beam power. The thermal blooming results in a central dip of the center lobe, and causes the center lobe to spread and decrease. In contrast with the center lobe, the side lobes are less affected by thermal blooming, such that the intensity maximum of the side lobe may be larger than that of the center lobe. However, the cross wind can reduce the effect of thermal blooming. When there exists the cross wind velocity v(x) in x direction, the dependence of centroid position in x direction on v(x) is not monotonic, and there exists a minimum, but the centroid position in y direction is nearly independent of v(x).

The field includes AD gene clustering by computing gene order which generates higher quality gene clustering patterns than most other clustering methods. However, there are few available gene order computing methods such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). Further, their performance in gene order computation using AD microarray data is not known. We thus set forth to evaluate the performances of current gene order computing methods with different distance formulas, and to identify additional features associated with gene order computation. Methods: Using different distance formulas- Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance, and other conditions, gene orders were calculated by ACO and GA (including standard GA and improved GA) methods, respectively. The qualities of the gene orders were compared, and new features from the calculated gene orders were identified. Results: Compared to the GA methods tested in this study, ACO fits the AD microarray data the best when calculating gene order. In addition, the following features were revealed: different distance formulas generated a different quality of gene order, and the commonly used Pearson distance was not the best distance formula when used with both GA and ACO methods for AD microarray data. Conclusion: Compared with Pearson distance and Euclidean distance, the squared Euclidean distance generated the best quality gene order computed by GA and ACO methods.

The structure and physical chemistry properties of the target molecule have been discussed, ranging from the traditional H-1 NMR and high-resolution mass spectroscopy (HRMS), over UV and PL spectra, and to the surface science research. The results revealed that the Py-TP2 molecule shows a narrowed energy gap between LUMO-HOMO and a bathochromic shift of 27 nm in the solid state as compared to that in solution, which is important for its practical applications in optoeletronic devices. Moreover, combined with DFT calculations, our STM results clearly show that the Py-TP2 molecule assembled into a stable long-ranged zigzag structure on HOPG surface. The interesting results in this contribution will boost the physical chemistry study of other functional materials under such methods.

We investigate the dependence of the transport properties on the wire-graphene coupling strength in detail. It is found that the peaks of the density of states fade away and the current is suppressed with the increasing wire-graphene coupling strength. The spin polarized strength of the two leads can effectively suppress the current and the transmission. The results obtained provide valuable theoretical guidance to the spintronics experiment.

In this paper, we propose a new FOPMD method for low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging, which is called regularized fully spatial FOPMD (RFS-FOPMD), whose numerical scheme is also given based on Grunwald-Letnikov derivative (G-L derivative). Here, fully spatial FOPMD represents all the integer-order derivatives (IODs) in the right hand of Perona-Malik Diffusion (PMD) which are replaced by fractional-order derivatives (FODs). Since the new scheme has advantages of both regularization and FOPMD, it has good abilities in singularities preserving while suppressing noise. Some real sinogram of LDCT are used to compare the different performances not only for some classical but also for some state-of-art diffusion schemes. These schemes include PMD, regularized PMD (RPMD), and FOPMD in (Hu et al. 2012). Experimental results show that besides good ability in edge preserving, the new scheme also has good stability for iteration number and can avoid artifacts and speckle effect with suitable parameters.

They are caused by not considering the discrete nature of digital signal. In order to improve the performance of AD in sinogram restoration of low-dosed computed tomography (LDCT), we propose a new AD method, named regularized multidirections and multiscales anisotropic diffusion (RMDMS-AD), by extending AD to regularized AD (RAD) in multidirections and multiscales. Since the multidirections can reduce the discrete errors to the maximum extent, meanwhile multiscales and RAD make searching neighborhood of solution be as large as possible which can get more optimal solution to AD, the new proposed method can improve the performance of AD both in denoising and in stability of solution. Moreover, the discrete errors and ill-posed solutions occur mostly near the EADs; the RMDMS-AD will also preserve EADs well. Comparing the proposed new method to existing AD methods using real sinogram, the new method shows good performance in EADs preserving while denoising and suppressing artifacts.

We investigate the exact travelling wave solutions of the nonlinear Schrodinger equation using three methods, namely, the auxiliary equation method, the first integral method, and the direct integral method. As a result, Jacobi elliptic function solution, hyperbolic function solution, trigonometric function solution, and rational solution with parameters are obtained successfully. When the parameters are taken as special values, the two known solitary wave solution and periodic wave solution are derived from the solutions obtained. The aim of the paper is to compare the efficiency of the three methods.

A splitting is used to establish the approximating equation of the system for a sufficiently small singular perturbation parameter. The approximating equation is a stochastic parabolic equation when the power exponent of the singular perturbation parameter is in [1/2, 1) but is a deterministic wave equation when the power exponent is in (1, +infinity). Moreover, if the power exponent of a singular perturbation parameter is bigger than or equal to 1/2, the same limiting equation of the system is derived in the sense of distribution, as the perturbation parameter tends to zero. This limiting equation is a deterministic parabolic equation.

Phase-dependent squeezing and entanglement in a cavity QED	OPTIK			English	Article						Squeezing; Entanglement; Cavity QED; Relative phase	ATOMIC SYSTEM; SINGLE-ATOM; QUANTUM; OUTPUT; LIGHT; FIELD	The output squeezed spectrum of the output two modes from a cavity QED system which is embedded by a four-level atom driven by two classical fields are calculated. The effects of the cavity decay rates, relative phase between two classical fields, and effective coupling constants between the atom and the cavity on the entanglement and squeezing of the two cavity modes are investigated. It is shown that the depth of the squeezing or entanglement spectrum is insensitive to the cavity decay rates while its width is dependent on the cavity decay rates and the coupling constants. In particular, the squeezing or entanglement spectrum including their maximal values and widths is remarkably affected by the relative phase between the classical fields. It is found that the output spectrum varies with the relative phase in a cosine-like behavior with a period of 2 pi. The results can indicate how to suitably adjust the relative phase for acquiring maximal squeezing or perfect entanglement for the two cavity fields.

To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to obtain the LMI-based stability criterion derived by a fixed point theory. It is worth mentioning that LMI methods have high efficiency and other advantages in largescale engineering calculations. And the feasibility of LMI-based stability criterion can efficiently be computed and confirmed by computer Matlab LMI toolbox. At the end of this paper, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Here we report the synthesis of three tetraphenylethene-triphenylene oligomers 7, 8E and 8Z by a CuSO4/sodium ascorbate catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (CuAAC), and the successful separation of the cis-and trans-isomers by column chromatography. The structure and conformation of the oligomers were fully characterized. The photophysical properties were studied by using UV-vision and photoluminescent (PL) spectroscopy. The morphology of the aggregates was investigated by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the thermal stability and mesomorphic properties were investigated using thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA), polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results revealed that the oligomers possess an AIE effect, but display no mesomorphism. However, 7 exhibits a hexagonal columnar mesophase when mixed with 2,4,7-trinitrofluorenone (TNF), forming a charge transfer complex.

Although species richness, composition, diversity and cover of moss communities vary, they grow well almost in all forests. Why mosses can grow in different conditions? What are the adaptive strategies of mosses in different forests along primary succession sequences? It is not still completely clear. In order to answer these questions, nutrient and carbohydrate accumulation in mosses were tested along the primary succession following deglaciation of Hailuogou glacier, Gongga Mountain, China. Nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) content, total organic carbon (TOC), soluble sugar and starch accumulated in the dominant moss species were determined and compared. TOC increased insignificantly with forest age. N, P, K contents in mosses were significantly higher in forests with dense shrubs, where N content was seperately 1.69% in A. hookeri and 1.35% in P. schreberi in 30 yr aged forest, P content in 30 yr and 52 yr aged forest was seperately 0.022% and 0.020% in A. hookeri and 0.020% and 0.017% in P. schreberi, and K content in 30 yr and 52 yr aged forest was seperately 0.570% and 0.553% in A. hookeri and 0.490% and 0.493% in P. schreberi. Soluble sugar was higher in the early stage of succession, but the opposite was observed for starch and non-structure carbohydrate content, which was lower in early successional stage. Mosses adopted different adaptive strategies in different aged forests along receding glacier, in which starch and N, P, K contents were key for adaptiation. That is, mosses accumulated much more starch in the severe environment of early succession stage. In more favourable environment, N, P, K was found to be accumulated for plant growth.

Thanks to some methods different from those of previous literature, the difficulties brought by fuzzy stochastic mathematical model and impulsive model have been overcome. By way of the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, It formula, Dynkin formula and a differential inequality, new LMI-based global stochastic exponential stability criteria for the above-mentioned PDEs are established. Some applications of the obtained results improve some existing results on neural networks.

The as-prepared CaWO4 microcrystallines were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra and photoluminescence spectra (FL). The growth process of these CaWO4 microcrystallines obtained in the presence of CTAB and PVA has been discussed. The structural characterization results indicate that the obtained CaWO4 are ellipsolid-like microcrystallines with the average size of approximate to 350 nm in short axis and approximate to 800 nm in long axis, and the CaWO4 microcrystallines possess a pure scheelite structure with a tetragonal symmetry. The FTIR spectra provide the evidence of W-O stretching vibration in [WO4](2-) tetrahedrons at 796 cm(-1) and W-O bending bands at 438 cm(-1). FL spectra reveal that the CaWO4 microcrystallines exhibit the only green peak at 430nm excited by ultraviolet ray (UV) with the wavelength at 220 nm, 240 nm and 260 nm, respectively. The SEM results indicate that the morphology of the CaWO4 microcrystallines can be affected by the concentration of surfactants.

Fuzzy mathematical model brings a great difficulty in setting up LMI criteria for the stability, and stochastic functional differential equations model with nonlinear diffusion makes it harder. To study the stability of fuzzy CGNNs with diffusion, we have to construct a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional in non-matrix form. But stochastic mathematical formulae are always described in matrix forms. By way of some variational methods in W-1,W-p(Omega), Ito formula, Dynkin formula, the semi-martingale convergence theorem, Schur Complement Theorem, and LMI technique, the LMI-based criteria on the robust exponential stability and almost sure exponential robust stability are finally obtained, the feasibility of which can efficiently be computed and confirmed by computer MatLab LMI toolbox. It is worth mentioning that even corollaries of the main results of this paper improve some recent related existing results. Moreover, some numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and less conservatism of the proposed method due to the significant improvement in the allowable upper bounds of time delays.

We find that the vacuum-induced coherence and the relative phase between probe and coupling fields can clearly affect the transient absorption (gain) properties, but the steady-state value of the probe absorption (gain) is remarkably dependent on the incoherent pumping. And the steady population distribution is sensitive to the incoherent pumping and insensitive to the relative phase. Additionally, it is shown that the lasing with inversion can be reached with the incoherent pumping. (c) 2013 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved.

The as-prepared catalyst was found to be highly active in aqueous-organic biphasic hydrogenation of quinoline, which exhibited 100% selectivity to 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline (py-THQ). Furthermore, the BWT-Pd catalyst can be reused 3 times without significant loss of catalytic activity, thus providing an effective and environmentally benign strategy for the production of py-THQ.

The polymer is shape memory polyurethane (SMPU) with carboxyl groups; the mesogenic unit, named as cholesteryl isonicotinate (INCh), is a liquid crystal compound with an electron-rich pyridine ring. The H-bonding interactions between carboxyl and pyridine ring are proved by FT-IR spectroscopic analysis and H-1 solid-state NMR. The introducing of INChs promotes the bonded PU segments to change into glassy form by restraining the movement of polymer chains, which is responsible for the triple-shape memory property. Therefore, the composite presents excellent triple-shape effect, and may be of great potential for applications in the biomedical field.

In this paper, we propose a simple way to improve the spatial adaptivity (SA) of NLMs using pointwise fractal dimension (PWFD). Unlike existing fractal image dimensions that are computed on the whole images or blocks of images, the new PWFD, named pointwise box-counting dimension (PWBCD), is computed for each image pixel. PWBCD uses a fixed size local window centered at the considered image pixel to fit the different local structures of images. Then based on PWBCD, a new method that uses PWBCD to improve SA of NLMs directly is proposed. That is, PWBCD is combined with the weight of the difference between local comparison windows for NLMs. Smoothing results for test images and real sinograms show that PWBCD-NLMs with well-chosen parameters can preserve anatomical features better while suppressing the noises efficiently. In addition, PWBCD-NLMs also has better performance both in visual quality and peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) than NLMs in LDCT imaging.

With experimentations, the new algorithm is thereafter evaluated. Design/methodology/approach - Nearest-neighbor algorithm is the earliest proposed and the main collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm, and its recommendation quality is seriously influenced by the sparsity of user ratings. By using rough set theory, the nearest-neighbor collaborative filtering algorithm can be improved in the sparsity data situation. The union of user rating items is used as the basis of similarity computing among users, and then a rating predicting method based on rough set theory is proposed to estimate missing values in the union of user rating items for decreasing sparsity. Findings - The sparsity problem of collaborative filtering can be alleviated by using the union of user rating items and estimating missing values based on rough set theory. The experimental results show that the new algorithm can efficiently improve recommendation quality of collaborative filtering. Originality/value - The union of user rating items was used as the basis of similarity computing among users. A rating prediction method based on rough set theory with an assistant method was proposed to complete the missing values in the union of user rating items. Orthogonal list was used to storage user-item ratings matrix.

This paper presents research on the existing clustering algorithm applied in heterogeneous sensor networks and then puts forward an energy-efficient prediction clustering algorithm, which is adaptive to sensor networks with energy and objects heterogeneous. This algorithm enables the nodes to select the cluster head according to factors such as energy and communication cost, thus the nodes with higher residual energy have higher probability to become a cluster head than those with lower residual energy, so that the network energy can be dissipated uniformly. In order to reduce energy consumption when broadcasting in clustering phase and prolong network lifetime, an energy consumption prediction model is established for regular data acquisition nodes. Simulation results show that compared with current clustering algorithms, this algorithm can achieve longer sensor network lifetime, higher energy efficiency, and superior network monitoring quality.

Considering an early arrival system, as soon as the server empties the system in a regular busy period, he leaves the system and takes a working vacation for a random duration at time n. The service times both in a working vacation and in a busy period and the vacation times are assumed to be geometrically distributed. By using embedded Markov chain approach and difference operator method, queue length of the whole system at random slots and the waiting time for an arriving customer are obtained. The queue length distributions of the outside observer's observation epoch are investigated. Numerical experiment is performed to validate the analytical results.

Data used in the study were obtained from 58 Malaysian Malays, 95 Malaysian Chinese, 242 Chinese from China, and 81 non-Asian Australians aged 12-19 years (M=15.72, SD=1.72) who were recruited from high schools. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing dissatisfaction with their body overall, and dissatisfaction with varying aspects of their body. Malaysian Chinese were the most dissatisfied with their bodies. After controlling for body mass index (BMI), age and dissatisfaction with weight/shape, upper, middle and lower body, and muscles, dissatisfaction with the face was positively correlated with overall body dissatisfaction among Malaysian Malays and Australians.

Our method is proven to be globally convergent to a solution of the variational inequality problem, provided the multi-valued mapping is continuous and pseudomonotone with nonempty compact convex values. We present an algorithmic framework of extragradient-type methods for multi-valued variational inequalities. Preliminary computational experience is also reported.

The monomers [HC C(CH2)(m)C18H6(OC6H13)(5); m = 1, 3] are prepared by consecutive etherization, coupling, and etherization reactions, and the chemical structures were confirmed by mass spectroscopy and H-1/C-13-NMR. The phase behaviors of the monomers were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), polarized light microscopy (PLM), and wide-angle X-ray diffraction (WAXD). The results show that both of the monomers form a hexagonal columnar liquid crystal phase at room temperature. The monomers are polymerized using [Rh(nbd)Cl](2) as catalyst and producing soluble polymers in the yields of 55% and 52%, respectively. The chemical structures and phase behaviors of the two polymers are characterized and evaluated by IR, NMR, TGA, DSC, and WAXD analyses. Both of the two polymers show enhanced thermal and chemical stability with thermal decomposition temperatures up to higher than 340 degrees C due to the protection of the "jacketed effect" of the side-chain triphenylenes wrapped around the rigid polyacetylene main-chain. The polymers adopt a columnar shaped structure and self-organized into hexagonally packed columnar phase. The relative electron density maps of the columnar structure are also reconstructed.

Both products are liquid crystals at room temperature; one trimer exhibits an ordered hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colho) and a plastic hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colhp) on cooling, and just a plastic hexagonal columnar on heating, whilst the other displays an ordered rectangular columnar mesophase (Colro).

It's very significant that designing fast algorithm for set operation. In this paper, the quantum algorithm for calculating intersection set is presented. Its runtime is for case and for case (i.e. C is empty set), while classical computation needs O (|A| x |B|) steps of computation in general, where |.| denotes the size of set. The presented algorithm is the combination of Grover's algorithm, classical memory and classical iterative computation, and the combination method decrease the complexity of designing quantum algorithm. The method can be used to design other set operations as well.

First, an auxiliary mixed equilibrium problem (AMEP) is introduced. The existence and the uniqueness of the solutions to the AMEP are proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions. Next, by using the solution mapping of the AMEP, a system of generalized equation problems (SGEP) is considered, and its equivalence with the SGMIEP is shown. By using the SGEP, a new iterative algorithm for solving the SGMIEP is proposed and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new, which unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

Our probabilistic shape model estimates the probability of an individual voxel belonging to the estimated shape of the object. The probability density of the estimated shape is derived from a combination of the shape variations of target class and the observed shape information. To better capture the shape variations, we used probabilistic principle component analysis optimized by expectation maximization to capture the shape variations and reduce computational complexity. The maximum a posteriori estimation was optimized by the iterated conditional mode-expectation maximization. We used 72 training datasets including low-and high-contrast computed tomography images to construct the shape models for the liver, spleen, and both kidneys. We evaluated our algorithm on 40 test datasets that were grouped into normal (34 normal cases) and pathologic (six datasets) classes. The testing datasets were from different databases and manual segmentation was performed by different clinicians. We measured the volumetric overlap percentage error, relative volume difference, average square symmetric surface distance, false positive rate, and false negative rate and our method achieved accurate and robust segmentation for multiple abdominal organs simultaneously.

Different from many previous related literatures, the nonlinear p-Laplace diffusion item plays its role in the new criterion though the nonlinear p-Laplace presents great difficulties. Moreover, numerical examples illustrate that our new stability criterion can judge what the previous criteria cannot do.

Energy Prices and Housing Property Demand in Shanghai, China	ENERGY SOURCES PART B-ECONOMICS PLANNING AND POLICY			English	Article						cointegration; energy price; finite sample; housing demand; industrial output; structural break; weak exogeneity	EXPLAINING COINTEGRATION ANALYSIS; LIKELIHOOD RATIO TESTS; RESIDENTIAL ENERGY; IMPROVEMENTS	This study investigates long-run relations among the prices of fuel and power, sales of new residential constructions, and total industrial output in Shanghai, China. Structural break and unit root tests show that these three variables each contain a unit root. Allowing for finite-sample biases, a trivariate cointegration system is suggested. Both housing property demand and industrial output are weakly exogenous for the equilibrium system, but energy prices are not. Therefore, the results imply that housing demand influences energy prices in the long run, but not vice versa. By decreasing the demand (or expected demand) for residential property, municipal authorities could expect to restrain or reduce energy use and prices, thereby facilitating the restructuring of the economy into a resource-saving one.

The results of X-ray diffraction show that the ceramics exhibit a pure perovskite structure at 0 <= x <= 0.175 and 0 <= y <= 0.175, suggesting that Ca2+ and Zr4+ diffuse into BaTiO3 lattices to form a solid solution. The substitution of Zr4+ for the B-site Ti4+ ions of BaTiO3 decreases greatly Curie temperature T-C and strengthens the relaxor character of the ceramics, while the addition of Ca2+ has a weak influence on T-C and leads to an inhibition of grain growth. Owing to the more possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases near room temperature, the ceramics with x = 0.075-0.125 and y = 0.1 exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 254-345 pC/N and k(p) = 38.0-45.2%, respectively.

Thirteen stable structures for the catechin-thymine complexes have been found which form two hydrogen bonds at least. The vibrational frequencies are also studied at the same level to analyze these complexes. The results indicated that catechin interacted with thymine by three different hydrogen bonds as N-H center dot center dot center dot O, C-H center dot center dot center dot O, O-H center dot center dot center dot O and the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Theories of atoms in molecules and natural bond orbital have been adopted to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all systems. The interaction energies of all complexes have been corrected for basis set superposition error, which are from -18.15 kJ/mol to -32.99 kJ/mol. The results showed that the hydrogen bonding contribute to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in agreement with experimental results.

Compared with the previous researches, the new technique can provide more and accurate information. In this study, ultrasound diagnosis shows that longitudinal wave can real-time characterize the data of the injection process and polymer morphology changes, including melt flow arrival time, the part ejection time, filling and packing stages, polymer solidification process, and the morphology changes during polymer crystallization. Shear waves can real-time diagnose Young's and shear storage modulus, anisotropy property of polymer in injection molding. During our research, real-time ultrasonic diagnosis shows that the storage modulus along the vertical direction is larger than that of the parallel to the melt flow direction under our setup injection conditions. Scanning electron microscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis measurements present that it is because the crystalline lamellas of HDPE are parallel arrangement and grow in a vertical to melt flow direction owing to injection shear force under a certain injection conditions.

Fast and efficient multidimensional scaling algorithm for mobile positioning	IET SIGNAL PROCESSING			English	Article							MITIGATION	Mobile station (MS) localisation that plays an important role in the process of target continuous localisation has received considerable attention. In this study, a new framework based on subspace approach for positioning an MS at minimum localisation system with the use of time-of-arrival measurements is introduced. Unlike ordinary multidimensional scaling algorithm using eigendcomposition or inverse computation to estimate the MS position, a computationally simple weighting estimator is proposed by introducing Lagrange multiplier and mean-square error weighting matrix. Computer simulations are included to corroborate the theoretical development and to contrast the estimator performance with several conventional algorithms as well as the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). It is shown that the new method with low computational complexity attains the CRLB for zero-mean white Gaussian range error at moderate noise level.

The ceramics with perovskite structure are transformed from tetragonal to pseudocubic phases by increasing the doping level of MnO2. After the addition of MnO2, the Curie temperature T-C of the ceramics decreases and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition at T-C becomes more diffusive. Because of the donor and acceptor doping effects of Mn ions simultaneously, the piezoelectric constant d(33), electromechanical coupling coefficient k(p), relative permittivity epsilon(r), and mechanical quality factor Q(m) are enhanced considerably after the addition of 1 mol% MnO2. The ceramic with 1 mol% MnO2 doping possesses the optimum piezoelectricity (d(33) = 131 pC/N and k(p) = 21.8%) and relatively high Q(m) = 627. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

(E)-4-(3,4-Dimethoxybenzylidene)-6,7-dimethoxy-1H-isochromen-3(4H)-one (6), oxided by 2,3-dichloro-5,6-dicyanobenzoquinone (DDQ)/CH3SO3H in CH2Cl2, gave no polymethoxy-substituted phenanthrene derivative (1) but unexpected 3-(2-(hydroxymethyl)-4,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-6,7-dimethoxy-2H-chromen-2-one (2) and 4,5-dimethoxy-2-(6,7-dimethoxy-2-oxo-2H-chromen-3-yl)benzaldehyde (3). Further experiments showed that the steric hindrance of a ring of isochromen-3-one (6) resulted in coumarin (2) not phenanthrene derivative (1), supported by comparative experiments of 2,3-diphenylacrylic acid (10, 12). The possible mechanism of 2 via radical cation and 3 through oxidation of precursor of 2 was proposed based on the result of experiments.

Following problems will be discussed: 1) The probability that the server is in a "generalized busy period" at time n; 2) The probability that the service station is in failure at time n, i.e., the transient unavailability of the service station, and the steady state unavailability of the service station; 3) The expected number of service station failures during the time interval (0, n], and the steady state failure frequency of the service station; 4) The expected number of service station breakdowns in a server's "generalized busy period". Finally, the authors demonstrate that some common discrete-time queueing models with unreliable service station are special cases of the model discussed in this paper.

The phase structure is analysed for a strong-coupling Thirring model. Subsequently, a soliton star model with cool Fermi matter coupling is constructed. We found that the soliton state and the mass of a star can change the density and pressure of matter at certain temperatures. Moreover, the stability of dark energy in the center of a star is proved when the coupling coefficient of the scalar field and Fermi matter satisfies some constraint conditions.

First, a system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems are introduced. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems is proved. Next, by using the auxiliary principle technique, an iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed equilibrium problems is constructed. Finally, the existence of solutions and the convergence of iterative sequences generated by the algorithm are proved under suitable conditions. These results improve, unify, and generalize many corresponding known results given in literature.

The insensitizing problem consists in finding a control function such that some energy functional of the equation is locally insensitive to a perturbation of the initial data. As usual, this problem can be reduced to a partially null controllability problem for a cascade system of two parabolic equations with equivalued surface boundary conditions. Compared the problems with usual boundary conditions, in the present case we need to derive a new global Carleman estimate, for which, in particular one needs to construct a new weight function to match the equivalued surface boundary conditions.

Here, the ring and a tangential lead form a single collimating contact. In the framework of Floquet scattering theory, we exactly treat such tunneling problems. Our numerical results clearly show that if the incident electronic energy E equals to the integer times of the driven frequency omega, i.e., E=nh omega, n = 1,2,3,..., then the resonant peaks of transmissions (along the tangential-connected lead) reveal. The feasibility to test such an effect, due to the nonelastic interactions between the transported electrons and the applied oscillating external fields, is also discussed. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Y.			3D calculation of hysteresis loops, magnetic orientations and reversal processes for exchange-spring bilayers with perpendicular anisotropy	PHYSICA B-CONDENSED MATTER			English	Article						Hard/soft bilayers; Hysteresis loops; 3D micromagnetic calculation	ENERGY PRODUCT; NUCLEATION; COERCIVITY; FILMS; NANOLAYERS; MEDIA	Hysteresisloops and magneticreversalprocesses have been determined by a three dimensional (3D) micromagnetic model for exchange-coupled Nd2Fe14B/alpha-Fe bilayers and carefully compared with a popular one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic model. It is found that the calculated hysteresisloops, the critical fields and the magnetic phase diagrams agree well with the results given by the 1D model. However, the calculated nucleation mode is a quasi-curling one where the magnetic moment exhibits a curling in the film plane and varies in the thickness direction, in contrast with the reported quasi-coherent mode. The calculated spatial distribution of the magnetization orientation in the thickness direction at various applied fields signifies a three-step magneticreversalprocess, which includes nucleation, growth and displacement of the domain wall as well as the rotation and the reversal of magnetization in the hard phase. The magneticreversal of the hard phase is much slower than that given by the 1D model, leading to a more slant hysteresisloop near the coercivity point. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Investigation of eccentric PVA brush behaviors in post-Cu CMP cleaning	MICROELECTRONIC ENGINEERING			English	Article						CMP; PVA brush; Cleaning; Eccentric; Tribology		Behavior of an eccentric PVA brush is investigated during post-Cu chemical mechanical planarization (CMP) brush cleaning. It is observed that the measured contact pressure and contact area of the eccentric brush vary significantly under different brush orientations. Moreover, the eccentric brush behaves differently from the good (i.e. concentric) brush in both the variance of shear force as well as the force spectra during cleaning. This study provides a rapid detection method to screen out eccentric brushes before they are used in semiconductor manufacturing, thereby potentially reducing wafer defects as well as chemical, water, and energy consumption associated with using eccentric PVA brushes.

N.			3D and 1D micromagnetic calculation for hard/soft bilayers with in-plane easy axes	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Hard/soft bilayer; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetic calculation	REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MAGNETS; NANOLAYERS	Macroscopic hysteresis loops and microscopic magnetic moment distributions have been determined by three-dimensional (3D) as well as one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic models for exchange coupled Nd2Fe14B/alpha-Fe bilayers and carefully compared with each other. It is found that the results obtained from the two methods are consistent with each other, where the nucleation and coercive fields decrease monotonically as the soft layer thickness L-s increases whilst the largest maximum energy products (roughly 600 kJ/m(3)) occur at L-s = 5 nm. Moreover, the calculated angular distributions in the thickness direction for the magnetic moments are similar. Nevertheless, the calculated critical fields and energy products by 3D OOMMF are systematically smaller than those given by the 1D model, mainly due to the local demagnetization fields, which are taken into account in the 3D calculation and ignored in the 1D calculation. It is demonstrated by the 3D calculation that the large demagnetization fields in the corners of the soft layers reduce the nucleation fields and thus facilitate the magnetic reversal. Such an effect enhancesas L-s increases. When L-s=20 nm, the differences between the coercivity is as large as 30%, while the nucleation fields obtained by the two methods have opposite signs.

All the ceramics possess a pure perovskite structure. The coexistence of tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is formed at room temperature in the ceramics with 0.45 <= x <= 0.55. The tetragonal-orthorhombic phase-transition temperature TO-T decreases from 110 to 54 degrees C with x increasing from 0.35 to 0.55 and then increases from 84 to 144 degrees C with x further increasing from 0.6 to 0.7, while the Curie temperature T-C deceases from 388 to 348 degrees C with x increasing from 0.35 to 0.70. Because of the coexistence of the two phases near room temperature, the ceramics with x = 0.50 exhibit the optimum piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 230 pC/N and k(p) = 49%. The ceramics possess good time stability of piezoelectric properties. (C) 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The results indicate that as the intensity of the electromagnetic filed increased, the radial distribution functions of the aqueous solution of N,N-dimethyl formamide became more pronounced. There appears to be a threshold microwave field intensity below which no tangible field effects are apparent, 10(5) V/m, the lowest field strength used in this study, there was no significant effect on the systems structure. Microwave energy is partly transferred to intermolecular energies of mixture, which induce the change of angle distribution functions of the hydrogen bonding.

The M-2-factor of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is always larger than that of truncated Gaussian beams both in free space and in turbulence. However, in turbulence the beam quality of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs may be better than that of truncated Gaussian beams if the z(R) is taken as the characteristic parameter of beam quality. For laser beams with AMs and PFs in turbulence, the beam quality expressed in terms of z(R) is consistent with that in terms of the M-2-factor versus the phase fluctuation parameter alpha, but not versus the intensity modulation parameter sigma(A). The beam quality of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is less sensitive to turbulence than that of truncated Gaussian beams. The beam quality of laser beams with smaller alpha and larger sigma(A) is less affected by turbulence than those with larger alpha and smaller sigma(A). (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

It is found that the pressures for transition from the NaCl structure to the CsCl structure are 364.1 GPa (for GGA) and 322.2 (for LDA) from equal enthalpies. The calculated ground state properties such as equilibrium lattice constant, bulk modulus, and its pressure derivative are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical data of others.

All the ceramics possess a perovskite structure with orthorhombic symmetry, indicating that (Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 diffuses into NaNbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution. A low (Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 doping level transforms the NaNbO3 ceramics from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The ceramics with x <= 0.075 are normal ferroelectric, and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase become diffusives with the doping level of Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 increasing. As x increases, the Curie temperature of the ceramics decreases linearly, while the relative permittivity er increases. 0.925NaNbO(3)-0.075(Bi0.5Li0.5)TiO3 ceramic exhibits the relatively large piezoelectric constant (d(33) = 58 pC/N), high Curie temperature (T-C = 228 degrees C) and good temperature stability, suggesting that the ceramics are one of new possible candidates for lead-free piezoelectric materials.

Three stable phases were considered, i.e., two hexagonal phases (epsilon and theta) and a cubic delta phase. The obtained equilibrium structure parameters and ground state mechanical properties are in excellent agreement with the experimental and other theoretical results. A full elastic tensor and crystal anisotropy of the ultra-incompressible TaN in three stable phases are determined in the wide pressure range. Results indicated that the elastic properties of TaN in three phases are strongly pressure dependent. And the hexagonal theta-TaN is the most ultraincompressible among the consider phases, which suggests that the theta phase of TaN is a potential candidate structure to be one of the ultraincompressible and hard materials. By the elastic stability criteria, it is predicted that theta-TaN is not stable above 53.9 GPa. In addition, the calculated B/G ratio indicated that the epsilon and delta phases possess brittle nature in the range of pressure from 0 to 100 GPa. While theta phase is brittleness at low pressure (below 8.2 GPa) and is strongly prone to ductility at high pressure (above 8.2 GPa). The calculated elastic anisotropic factors for three phases of TaN suggest that they are elastically highly anisotropic and strongly dependent on the propagation direction.

The results showed that appropriate concentration range of REE could promote Spirodela polyrhiza absorbing N, P effectively, improve the carbonic anhydrase activity (a maximum value of 0.684 EU/mu g) and improve the efficiency of light energy utilization and transformation which made photosynthesis improved and thus it could promote plant growth, with the highest rate of growth of Spirodela polyrhiza reaching 63.85% and maximum value of chlorophyll up to 9.594 mg/L and further, with the increase of Spirodela polyrhiza breeding density, dissolved oxygen (DO) reduced but chemical oxygen demand (COD) raised (a maximum value of 6.448 mg/L) in water, which eventually led to the water quality worsen. The research results demonstrate that the suitable contents of REE can promote small aquatic plants such as Spirodela polyrhiza growing, thereby contributing a positive catalytic effect to the development process of eutrophication. This no doubt provides basic theory for sustainable development and utilization of rare earth and provides a scientific basis for the study of rare earth influencing on the promoting regularity of water eutrophication and integrated control of water pollution.

The importance of H2D+ in the areas such as astrophysics is stated and the study on H2D+ of recent years is outlined. The formation mechanism for the H2D+ under laboratory conditions is also analysed. The structural pattern of H2D+ and the mean internuclear separation are determined using Coulomb explosion technique. Once again, the existence of wake effects in the interaction of molecular ions with solid is confirmed and three-body wake effect module is used to determine the geometric structure of H2D+. Finally, the unusual structure of the wake of energy spectrum for the heavier ions in the H2D+ Coulomb explosion is discussed.

Thicker and larger ring sized annular beams are found to exhibit larger absolute field correlations. For the same transverse distance at the receiver plane, annular beams attain larger field correlations if the transverse distance starts from the receiver origin. Comparisons of the annular beam absolute field correlations in extremely strong turbulence with the no turbulence results show that the absolute field correlation variations follow similar trends, except that the magnitudes of the absolute field correlations are much smaller in extremely strong turbulence and the annular fields become decorrelated at very short transverse distances. When the inner scale of turbulence becomes smaller, the absolute field correlations of the annular beams in extremely strong turbulence become smaller. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this letter, an effective OFDMA cellular mobile system based on multiple fractional Fourier transform (FrFT) angle reuse scheme is proposed. In this system, FrFT angle is regarded as new resource, which can be optimally allocated to each BS of cellular system. Because chirp bases, generated by different FrFT with optimally allocated angle, are mutually approximately orthogonal at same subcarrier, ICI can be perfectly suppressed. Both theory and simulations show the essential advantages over conventional OFDMA cellular systems for ICI suppression and bit error rate.

The pressure effect for the cell volume, lattice constants, and molecular geometry of solid PE are presented and discussed. It is observed that the C-C bonds has maximum variation, followed by C-H and C-O bonds, which means decomposition of the initial explosion may begin with the C-C bonds. The vibrational frequencies at ambient conditions slightly more than experimental results, and the pressure-induced frequency shifts of these modes are discussed. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, we divide the network into rings, and then have an analysis and calculation on nodes' energy consumption in each ring of the network when clustering algorithm is applied to collect data. We also put forward a scheme of nonuniform node distribution on the basis of the proportion of nodes' energy consumption in each ring, and change nodes' active/hibernating states under density control mechanism when network coverage is guaranteed. Simulation shows NNDC algorithm can satisfyingly balance nodes' energy consumption and effectively avoid the problem of energy hole.

Based on CBC, an anonymous authentication protocol featured with conditional privacy preservation and non-repudiation is proposed for vehicular ad-hoc network. First, a certificate-based signature scheme with only one pairing computation and only one element signature is proposed. Then, an anonymous authentication protocol is constructed by applying the proposed signature scheme and a novel concept called the account index which helps to realize On-Board Units anonymity, non-reputation, and conditional privacy preservation. A secure session key is established in the protocol which provides perfect forward secrecy.

Our numerical results clearly show that the transporting probabilities of the incident photons are controlled by adjusting the coupling strength between the quantum dot and the surface plasmons.

Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3 diffuses into NaNbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with perovskite structure. The addition of Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3(x >= 0.025) transforms NaNbO3 from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The diffusive ferroelectric - paraelectric phase transition is induced in the ceramics with high concentration of Ba0.85Ca0.15(Ti0.9Zr0.1)O-3. The ceramics with x = 0.05-0.125 possess large P-r values of 18.6-25.5 mu C/cm(2). A morphotropic phase boundary between tetragonal and orthorhombic phases is formed at 0.05 < x < 0.15, leading to a significant enhancement of piezoelectric properties. The ceramic with x = 0.125 situated near the morphotropic phase boundary exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties. d(33) = 151 pC/N and k(p) = 31.6%.

On the one hand, for c(0) = +infinity we obtain two finite time blow-up results of solutions to the aforementioned system. One is obtained under the condition alpha >= 0 and 1 + 4/N <= p < N+2/N-2 or alpha < 0 and 1 < p < 1 + 4/N (N = 2,3); the other is established under the condition N = 3, 1 < p < N+2/N-2 and alpha(p - 3) >= 0. On the other hand, for c(0) < +infinity and alpha(p - 3) >= 0, we prove a blow-up result for solutions with negative energy to the Zakhasov system under study.

The analytic formula of the effective radius R of curvature of truncated laser beams with amplitude modulations (AMs) and PFs propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived by using the statistical optics method. It is shown that the R in free space increases with the increases of the phase fluctuation parameter, the intensity modulation parameter and the truncated parameter. And the influence of turbulence on the R also increases with the increases of the three parameters. Furthermore, the R of Gaussian beams is largest in free space, but it is most affected by turbulence. Therefore, in turbulence the R of truncated laser beams with AMs and PFs is even larger than that of Gaussian beams when the propagation distance is large enough. In particular, the relative effective radius R-r of curvature varies non-monotonically with propagation distance, and there exists a minimum at a propagation distance where the influence of turbulence on the R is largest. In addition, the position where the R-r reaches its minimum increases with the increasees of intensity modulation and phase fluctuation.

Three structures are chosen to investigate for RhN2, namely, simple hexagonal P6/mmm (denoted as SH), orthorhombic Pnnm (marcasite), and simple tetragonal P4/mbm (denoted as ST). Our calculations show that the SH phase is energetically more stable than the other two phases at zero pressure. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, we find that the phase transition pressures from an SH to a marcasite structure and from a marcasite to an ST structure are 1.09 GPa and 354.57 GPa, respectively. Elastic constants, formation enthalpies, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Debye temperature of RhN2 are derived. The calculated values are, generally speaking, in good agreement with the previous theoretical results. Meanwhile, it is found that the pressure has an important influence on physical properties. Moreover, the effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of RhN2 is investigated. This is a quantitative investigation on the structural properties of RhN2, and it still awaits experimental confirmation.

The method was applied to images of western Sichuan Province, China taken between 2002 and 2008. The model for extracting data on snow cover from MODIS images was created by spectral analysis. The multi-temporal snow layers were used to evaluate the temporal and spatial change in the area under snow cover between 2002 and 2008 using overlay and statistical analysis in ARCGIS. The majority (60.4%) of western Sichuan was rarely covered by snow and only 0.3% was covered by perennial snow in 2002. Snow cover was primarily distributed in Garz and Aba. The area under snow cover was significantly and negatively correlated with the average monthly temperature and rainfall in 2002. The largest area under snow cover was measured in 2006 and the smallest was in 2007. Similarly, the area of snowmelt was the highest in 2006 and lowest in 2007. In general, the elevation of the snow line increased throughout the period 2002-2008; however, the elevation decreased in some years. Our results provide an important insight into the distribution of snow in this region, and may be useful for climate modeling and predicting the availability of water resources and the occurrence of floods and droughts.

Near-field and far-field spreading of partially coherent annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							DARK HOLLOW BEAMS; RANDOM-MEDIA; DIRECTIONALITY	Based on the extended Huygens-Fresnel principle, closed-form expressions for the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle of partially coherent annular beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived by using the Wigner distribution function (WDF). Taking the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle as the characteristic parameters of near-field and far-field spreading, respectively, the spreading of partially coherent annular beams both in free space and in turbulence is studied in detail. It is found that the effect of the strength of turbulence and beam parameters (e.g., the spatial correlation length, the waist width, and the wave length) on the beam spreading in the near field is in agreement with that in the far field. However, in turbulence, the effect of the obscure ratio of annular beams on the spreading is different between in the near field and in the far field. Namely, in turbulence the beam spreading in the near field becomes smaller and the beam spreading in the far field becomes larger as the obscure ratio increases. In particular, the effect of turbulence on the Rayleigh range and the far-field divergence angle is nearly unchanged versus the obscure ratio when the spatial correlation length is small. The main results obtained in this paper are explained physically.

Magnetotransport anisotropy in lattice-misfit-strained ultrathin La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 films epitaxially grown on (110)-oriented SrTiO3 and LaAlO3 substrates	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETORESISTANCE; MAGNETOSTRICTION	(110)-Oriented manganite thin films are essential for studies on the interface effects concerning spin-polarized electron injection, especially the proximity effect with high temperature superconducting cuprates. However, due to the peculiarity of the (110) plane, an atomically smooth surface generally can only sustain up to a quite low film thickness. Therefore, anisotropy along the two crystallographically asymmetric [001] and [1 (1) over bar0] in-plane directions in ultrathin (110)-oriented manganite films are worthy of a careful investigation. Here, studies on the magnetotransport anisotropy of (110)-oriented epitaxial La2/3Ca1/3MnO3 (LCMO) thin films of 20 nm thickness grown by pulsed laser deposition are reported. Both SrTiO3 (STO) and LaAlO3 (LAO) substrates were adopted to highlight the lattice-misfit-strain effects. While in LCMO/STO film, the magnetic easy axis is along the [1 (1) over bar0] direction, in LCMO/LAO film the [001] direction is easier. Accordingly, the resistivity and magnetoresistance measured along the easy axes are lower. The correlation between the magnetic and transport anisotropy then has been undoubtedly demonstrated. For the LCMO films on STO, property evolutions with temperature and magnetic field are free from fine features, and thus clear and easily understood, making STO a more appropriate substrate for interface studies in (110)-oriented heterostructures.

This study investigated the factor structure and psychometric properties of the Chinese version of the Resilience Scale (RS) for college students with Wenchuan earthquake exposure. Methods: A total of 888 Chinese college students with Wenchuan earthquake exposure completed a set of scales, including the RS, the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Self-rating Scale, the Zung Self-rating Depression Scale, the Zung Self-rating Anxiety Scale, and the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire Short Scale for Chinese. The internal consistency and concurrent validity were investigated. Sex and regional differences were also examined. Results: The results of exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis showed that the 4-factor structure was suitable for both Chinese samples 1 and 2. The Cronbach a coefficient was .94 (P < .01), split-half reliability coefficient was .92 (P < .01), and the test-retest reliability coefficient was .82 (P < .01). The total resilience score was correlated negatively with posttraumatic stress disorder (r = 0.21; P < .01), depression (r = 0.45; P < .01), anxiety(r = 0.34; P < .01), and neuroticism (r = 0.23; P < .01), and correlated positively with extraversion (r = 0.23; P < .01). Men showed higher resilience scores than women, and people living in the high earthquake-exposure areas reported higher level of resilience than those from low earthquake-exposure areas. Conclusions: The Chinese version of the RS was demonstrated to be a reliable and valid measurement in assessing resilience for Wenchuan earthquake survivors. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Significant deterioration of energy products in exchange-coupled composite magnets	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							PERMANENT-MAGNETS; NANOLAYERS; REMANENCE; MEDIA	Hysteresis loops and energy products have been calculated reliably for a hard/soft/hard trilayer system with a deviation of easy axis beta taken into account, which affects the coercivity significantly, and hence leads to much smaller energy products than those predicted by the previous theory. Such a deterioration is much sharper than the corresponding fall for a single-phased material and a 30 degrees deviation of in-plane easy axis could result in a drop of the maximum energy product by more than 60%. Consequently, the advantage of the composite phase can be realized only when the material is well oriented, which offers a possible explanation to the large discrepancy between the experimental and theoretical energy products.

Influence of Vessel Configuration and Size of Vessel Wall Based on the Numerical Analysis of Polar Solvent Heated by Microwave	ASIAN JOURNAL OF CHEMISTRY			English	Article						Microwave heating; Polar solvent; Temperature uniformity; Multiphysics	CHEMISTRY	The choice of vessel is vital for heating polar solvent. In this paper, water at silicon carbide or glass vessel with three different configurations and size of vessel wall were heated by microwave. The uniformities of temperature were analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics under different configurations and size of vessel wall during microwave heating. It was concluded that the temperature uniformities were influenced by the parameters of different configurations and size of vessel wall, when the improvement in temperature uniformity is not obvious for one configuration, it can be significantly improved by changing to another specific configuration and size of vessel wall.

In this paper, the heating uniformity of water with rotation or stir and their combination under microwaves were investigated through multiphysics calculation. It was found that among the three above cases, the temperature uniformity of water under microwave heating with the combination of stir and rotation is the best.

Seeking for new resistance source is urgently required to meet the challenge of the rapid loss of resistance due to the co-evolution of the pathogen's virulence. Wheat line 07jian126 (Triticum aestivum L.) is highly resistant to the Pm disease prevailing in Sichuan province of China. Previous study showed that a SSR marker Xbarc183 was linked to the Pm resistance in 07jian126, which might be controlled by a single dominant gene, designated as Pm07J126. In this study, two additional F-2 populations were used to confirm the linkage between Pm07J126 and Xbarc183. Furthermore, rye chromatin was detected in 07jian126 by molecular analysis of a rye-specific SCAR marker O5 which co-segregated with Pm07J126. This result indicated that Pm07J126 might originate from rye. The reaction patterns to 21 Bgt isolates and molecular marker analysis implied that Pm07J126 might be different from the known rye-derived Pm genes Pm7, Pm8, Pm17 and PmJZHM2RL. Chromosome observation, molecular marker, and A-PAGE analysis suggested that 07jian126 might be a rye introgression line and neither contain 1RS translocation nor secalins gene. Consequently, 07jian126 could be considered as a valuable resource for Pm resistance development of wheat. Besides, the molecular markers Xbarc183 and O5 are useful in marker-assisted selection of Pm07J126 in wheat breeding programs.

The white noises appear both in the model and in the dynamical boundary condition. Since the energy relation of this stochastic system does not directly imply the a priori estimate of the solution, we propose a pseudo energy equation to infer almost sure boundedness of the solution. Then a unique invariant measure is shown to exist for the system.

J	Liao, QY				Liao, Qunying			The Gaussian normal basis and its trace basis over finite fields	JOURNAL OF NUMBER THEORY			English	Article						Finite fields; Complexity; Trace map; Dual bases; Gaussian normal bases	NORMAL BASES; COMPLEXITY	It is well known that normal bases are useful for implementations of finite fields in various applications including coding theory, cryptography, signal processing, and so on. In particular, optimal normal bases are desirable. When no optimal normal basis exists, it is useful to have normal bases with low complexity. In this paper, we study the type k (>= 1) Gaussian normal basis N of the finite field extension F-qn/F-q, which is a classical normal basis with low complexity. By studying the multiplication table of N, we obtain the dual basis of N and the trace basis of N via arbitrary medium subfields F-qm/F-q with m vertical bar n and 1 <= m <= n. And then we determine all self-dual Gaussian normal bases. As an application, we obtain the precise multiplication table and the complexity of the type 2 Gaussian normal basis and then determine all optimal type 2 Gaussian normal bases.

The results show that, by selecting appropriate input optical power, as large as > 20 dB RIN suppression improvement can be achieved for R-SOA, without sacrificing the noise rejection bandwidth. With increased injection current, the optimized input signal power is decreased and the operation region is extended for the best RIN reduction. For RIN suppression in WDM spectrum slicing, the bandwidth optimization of receiver filter should be performed to avoid the spectral broadening induced by self-phase modulation (SPM) and four wave mixing (FWM). Our derived result is helpful for designing and optimizing the R-SOA in application of noise suppression enhancement. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The current paper presents a variant of the normalized cut (NCut) algorithm based on homogeneous patches (HP-NCut) for the segmentation of ultrasonic breast tumors. Methods: A novel boundary-detection function is defined by combining texture and intensity information to find the fuzzy boundaries in US images. Subsequently, based on the precalculated boundary map, an adaptive neighborhood according to image location referred to as a homogeneous patch (HP) is proposed. HPs are guaranteed to spread within the same tissue region; thus, the statistics of primary features within the HPs is more reliable in distinguishing the different tissues and benefits subsequent segmentation. Finally, the fuzzy distribution of textons within HPs is used as final image features, and the segmentation is obtained using the NCut framework. Results: The HP-NCut algorithm was evaluated on a large dataset of 100 breast US images (50 benign and 50 malignant). The mean Hausdorff distance measure, the mean minimum Euclidean distance measure and similarity measure achieved 7.1 pixels, 1.58 pixels, and 86.67%, respectively, for benign tumors while those achieved 10.57 pixels, 1.98 pixels, and 84.41%, respectively, for malignant tumors. Conclusions: The HP-NCut algorithm provided the improvement in accuracy and robustness compared with state-of-the-art methods. A conclusion that the HP-NCut algorithm is suitable for ultrasonic tumor segmentation problems can be drawn. (C) 2012 American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The results show that higher awards, easier tasks, longer duration and lower competition intensity lead to a higher number of solvers. Higher awards, longer duration and higher difficulty level of tasks lead to higher ability level of winners, but competition intensity and market price for other competing projects do not show significant correlation with the ability level of winners.

Inspired by Newton's universal gravitation model and based on binary differences strategy, we propose an algorithm for global optimization problems, which is called the binary difference gravitational evolution (BDGE) algorithm. BDGE is a population-based algorithm, and the population is composed of particles. Each particle is treated as a virtual object with two attributes of position and quality. Some of the best objects in the population compose the reference-group and the rest objects compose the floating-group. The BDGE algorithm could find the global optimum solutions through two critical operations: the self-update of reference-group and the interactive-update process between the reference-group and floating-group utilizing the gravitational evolution method. The parameters of BDGE are set by a trial-and-error process and the BDGE is proved that it can converge to the global optimal solution with probability 1. Benchmark functions are used to evaluate the performance of BDGE and to compare it with classic Differential Evolution. The simulation results illustrate the encouraging performance of the BDGE algorithm with regards to computing speed and accuracy.

Our phylogenetic results indicate: (1) the subfamily Natricinae is strongly supported as monophyletic including a majority of extant genera, and a poorly known and previously unassigned species Trachischium monticola, (2) two main clades are inferred within Natricinae, one containing solely taxa from the Old World (OW) and the other comprising taxa from a monophyletic New World (NW) group with a small number of OW relatives. Within the first clade, the genera Xenochrophis and Amphiesma are apparently not monophyletic. Divergence dating and ancestral area estimation indicate that the natricines originated in tropical Asia during the later Eocene or the Oligocene. We recover two major dispersals events out of Asia, the first to Africa in the Oligocene (28 Ma) and the second to the Western Palearctic and the New World at 27 Ma.

J	Gong, X; Li, XX; Feng, L; Xia, R				Gong, Xun; Li, Xin-Xin; Feng, Lin; Xia, Ran			A robust framework for face contour detection from clutter background	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MACHINE LEARNING AND CYBERNETICS			English	Article						Skin color; Single Gaussian model; Face contour; C-V; Level set		When applying Chan-Vese (C-V) model to segment a face from an image, the result is always influenced by the initial position, especially in a real scenarios with clutter background. An improved skin tone detection model is proposed based on the Gaussian function, which could generate an accurate initial contour for C-V model. As the single Gaussian model (SGM) only uses the prior information to determine the likelihood of a pixel, it lacks adaptability for an image with lighting and poses variances. A more adaptive SGM (ASGM) is proposed in this paper that, by updating the model parameters according to the input image, could provide a more stable approximation of face region. And then, we apply the estimated initial contour to C-V model for precise face segmentation. Tests conducted on a public face dataset (220 images with pose and illumination changes) have shown that the accuracy of skin region detected by ASGM is at a ratio higher than 99%, which lays a good foundation for further segmentation by the C-V model. Extensive experiments have validated effectiveness and efficiency of our system in face segmentation.

First, an auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problem (AGMEP) to compute the approximate solutions of the generalized mixed equilibrium problems (GMEP) and bilevel generalized mixed equilibrium problems (BGMEP) involving set-valued mappings is introduced. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and uniqueness of solutions of the AGMEP is proved under quite mild conditions. By using auxiliary principle technique, new iterative algorithm to compute the approximate solutions of the GMEP and the BGMEP is suggested and analyzed. Strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the proposed algorithms is proved under quite mild assumptions. These results are new and generalize some recent results in this field.

We put the background spacetime into the Kruskal-like coordinate to find the period with respect to Elucidean time. Our result shows that area spectrum of the rotating black hole is evenly spaced and the spacing is the same as the one of Schwarzschild black hole, indicating that area spectrum of a black hole is independent of its parameters. Different from the quasinormal mode analysis, our study need not to impose the small angular momentum limit.

The spatial and temporal evolution of the predominantly strike-slip movement along the fault remains unclear, as estimates for the initiation age of its different segments range from 5 to 13 Ma. The Jinhe-Qinghe fault (JqF; the south part of the Longmen Shan thrust belt) provides a key for understanding the tectonic role and deformation history of the Xianshuihe-Xiaojiang fault zone in terms of timing, magnitude of displacement, and spatial-temporal evolution. This paper presents research on the structure and chronology of the JqF. The results of a geometric and kinematic study of the Jinhe-Qinghe fault show it to be a thrust fault with a left-lateral strike slip component: The strike slip offset extends at least 13-18 km to southwest, based on the shortening of its folds and faulting, and based on stream deflection. Ten apatite fission track apparent ages shows pronounced change in age/elevation gradient at similar to 17 +/- 2 Ma, consistent with an abrupt increase of exhumation due to uplift of the hanging wall of the JqF at that time. Combined with the age of deformed Tertiary strata in the footwall of the JqF and the geometric relationships of the JqF with the Chenghai fault and the XFZ, this indicates that the JqF was active between 17 and 5 Ma. Based on the fault chronology, geometry, and movement, we suggest that the fault was a transpressional structure at the south end of the XFZ during the period from 17 to 5 Ma. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

But this method can :not be very effective and precise in spatial alignment, due to a small number of moving objects in the scene, limited coverage of the trajectories and the short temporal duration of the trajectories. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a new sequence-to-sequence alignment method, combining the method proposed by Caspi et al. with a feature-based image registration method. In this paper, we made a comparison between our method and that of Caspi et al. Experimental results show that the presented method improves alignment precision both on X-axis orientation and on Y-axis orientation. The PSNR value is approximately improved by 13.5dB. At the same time, the time needed by Our-method will be slightly increased but can be ignored. When the results of the alignment are applied in space-time super-resolution reconstruction, the effect also proves the validity of our-method.

The results showed that: while increasing pressure up to 5.69 GPa, excitation energy for a soliton reduced from 10.02 to 3.64 eV, meanwhile the gap and the lattice distortion disappeared. Original band changed from style of a semiconductor to that of a metal. The results agree with the experimental observations that electrical conductivity is increasing with applied pressure until a saturated value. Our theory supports soliton-conduction mechanism for the polymer under pressures less than 5.69 GPa. Under higher pressure, carriers would be electrons as if in a metal.

The model of extracting vegetation from CBERS images was formulated using the differentiation knowledge of vegetation and non-vegetation discovered by image analysis and geographic analysis. The damage degree index (DDI) of the vegetation was defined here, which was the difference of the normalized difference vegetation index before the earthquake and that after earthquake. The China-Brazil Earth Resource Satellite (CBERS)-02's images acquired, respectively, on 6 May and 27 June 2008, the model of extracting vegetation, and DDI were used to obtain the information about the area and degree of the damage vegetation in the study. There was 87.94 square kilometers vegetation damaged by Wenchuan earthquake, which accounted for 7.9% of the total area in Dujiangyan city. The area percentage of the damage vegetation in each grade related strongly and positively to the elevation grade and slope grade and weakly related to the aspect type. The distribution characteristics of the damage vegetation were useful for making plan of restoring vegetation here.

The doped Ln ions have noticeable influences on the TE characteristics of [Ca2CoO3](0.62)[CoO2] system. The substitutions of Ln(3+) for Ca2+ change hole concentration and meanwhile introduce a strong point-defect phonon scattering. From Ln=La to Yb, the increased structural distortion, enhanced electron correlation, and increasing ionic mass fluctuation are responsible for the different TE response. Furthermore, compared with the ceramic bulks, in the highly textured nano-sized compacts the thermal conduction is efficiently suppressed. A doubling of ZT has been achieved by the nanoengineering (ZT exceeds 0.45 at 1000 K). On the basis of these results, some strategies for further improvement in ZT are proposed.

The absorption spectrum, PL spectra and photoluminescence efficiency of complexes were compared with the corresponding complexes with acetylacetone (acac) as the ancillary ligand. It was found that all of their photoluminescence efficiency could be improved when sterically hindered 3-acetyl camphor was introduced. When [(ppy)(2)Ir(acam)] was used as light-emitting devices, the EL spectra has the largest peak intensity at 516 nm. The device has the greatest brightness of 10930 cd/m(2) and maximum brightness efficiency of 14.6 cd/A at 12 V. The highest power effciency and brightness are 4.23 lm/W and 698 cd/m(2) respectively at 10.7 V.

J	Dou, LY; Ji, XL; Li, PY				Dou, Lingyu; Ji, Xiaoling; Li, Peiyun			Propagation of partially coherent annular beams with decentered field in turbulence along a slant path	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							DARK HOLLOW BEAMS; FLAT-TOPPED BEAMS; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; GAUSSIAN BEAMS; DIRECTIONALITY; MEDIA	The model of partially coherent annular beams with linear non-uniformity field profile in the x direction is set up. The analytic expressions for the average intensity and the centre of gravity of partially coherent annular beams with decentered field propagating through atmospheric turbulence along a slant path are derived. The propagation equation governing the position of the intensity maximum is also given. It is found that the beam non-uniformity is amended gradually as the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence increase. The centre of beam gravity is independent of both the propagation distance and the turbulence. However, the position of the intensity maximum changes versus the propagation distance and the turbulence, and is farthest away from the propagation z-axis at a certain propagation distance. When the propagation distance is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum reaches an asymptotic value which increases with decreasing the zenith angle and is largest for the free space case. When the propagation distance is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum is not on the propagation z-axis, and is nearer to the propagation z-axis than the centre of beam gravity. On the other hand, changes in the intensity maximum in the far field are also examined in this paper.

The simulation is performed by relaxing disordered copolymer nanodroplets in a solvent bath. Microphase separation is then carried out inside the nanodroplet, which allows block copolymers self-assemble into many new morphologies differing from those formed in pure melts or in solution. These patterned structures depend on the volume ratio of solvophilic/solvophobic blocks (R-H/T). As the value of R-H/T increases, the following structures are formed: plum-pudding microsphere, volleyball-like structure, multilamellar vesicle, cage-like structure, nanorods, and discrete micelles. Density analysis is performed to characterize the onion's structure. At high R-H/T values, block copolymers exhibit mainly solvophilicity and form swollen loose structures or small micelles suspended in the solvent. The simulation results are in good agreement with experimental and theoretical results.

The system error induced by the non-local effect worsens with increased powers of probe wave and Raman pump. For smaller Brillouin pump power, the non-local effect is almost independent of Brillouin pump power. For larger Brillouin pump power, the non-local effect deteriorates gradually due to Raman gain saturation and cross-gain modulation (XGM). The purely backward pumping (relative to probe light) is preferable for non-local effect suppression. The frequency-division multiplexing (FDM) and time-division-multiplexing (TDM) technologies exhibit similar performance for suppressing the non-local effect under the same conditions. The sensing range near the far-end (relative to the Brillouin pump) should be appropriately shorter to minimize the non-local effect in FDM and TDM. The physical mechanisms of the non-local effect in long-distance BOTDA with Raman amplification are also shown.

The performance comparisons on flatness of signal distribution, optical signal-noise ratio (OSNR), and noise figure (NF) among first-order, second-order, and third-order Raman pumping based on UL-FLs are discussed numerically. The results display that the gain distribution is pushed more uniformly along UL-FLs using third-order Raman pumping, which is very useful to further extend the quasi-lossless midspan distance. For transparency transmission, enhanced quasi-lossless transmission could be achieved without sacrifice to OSNR and NF. We also analyze the transmission dynamics of loss-managed fundamental solitons for different pumping configurations. The amplifier span and transmission quality are improved considerably, even for lower dispersion lengths, by employing the proposed scheme.

The observed values of the permittivity gradually increased with increasing concentration of methanol in ethanol, whereas the relaxation time decreased with increasing concentration and temperature. The increase in the dielectric I relaxation time in ethanol-methanol mixtures is attributed to the spatial constraints of ethanol molecules on the hydrogen-bond network. I the reorientation processes in pure liquids and mixtures are controlled by enthalpic rather than by entropic factors.

On the basis of electrostatics, rate theory, solution thermodynamics and hydrogen bond dynamics we have summarized dielectric "mixing rules" that describe the frequency-dependent dielectric properties of the solvent organic aqueous solution based on solution composition and the dielectric parameters for the solution components. These "mixing rules" yield good agreement between the predicted and experimental dielectric properties of DMF-water mixture's over all solution compositions.

Here, we reconstructed the phylogenetic relationships of the genus Blarinella based on one nuclear (ApoB) and two mitochondrial (cyt-b, 16S rRNA) genes. Our results supported the monophyly of the genus Blarinella and the valid species status of Blarinella wardi. Nevertheless, two morphologically defined Blarinella species, B. quadraticauda and B. griselda, were poorly differentiated by molecular data; B. quadraticauda was found embedded within B. griselda making the latter a paraphyletic group. These results indicate that B. quadraticauda might be under a budding speciation scenario or is a restricted geographical subspecies of B. griselda. Phylogeographic analyses suggest that diversification and speciation of Blarinella might have been promoted by vicariance events associated to the complex topography of Southwest China. Further morphological, genetic and ecological studies are necessary to examine these hypotheses.

Impact of step defects on surface states of topological insulators	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							SINGLE DIRAC CONE; BI2TE3	The eigenstates in the presence of a step defect (SD) along the x or y axis on the surface of topological insulators are exactly solved. It is shown that unlike the electronic states in conventional metals, the topological surface states across the SD can produce spin rotations. The magnitudes of the spin rotations depend on the height and direction of the SD. The oscillations of local density of states (LDOS) are characterized by a wave vector connecting two points on the hexagonal constant-energy contour at higher energies. The period of the oscillation caused by the SD along the y axis is root 3 (1/root 3) times that induced by the SD along the x axis at a larger positive (negative) bias voltage. With increasing the bias voltage, the period of the oscillation, insensitive to the strength of the SD, becomes smaller. At lower energies near the Fermi surface, the two types of wave vectors coexist in the LDOS modulations. These results are consistent qualitatively with recent observations of scanning tunneling microscopy.	[Zhang, Degang; Ting, C.

We find that the properties of transient process can be greatly affected by the SV whether the vacuum-induced coherence (VIC) exists or not. The combined influence of the SV and the VIC can dramatically modify the transient absorption and gain. Especially, the transient gain can be almost eliminated in the absence of VIC. And the response time from the transient to the steady situation is dependent on the SV. When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV. Besides, it is shown that the considerable steady state population without inversion can be always induced by the SV.

On the basis of Marcus theory, the charge-transfer is the course of electron-electron interaction and electron-phonon interaction, and the greater the electron-phonon interaction coupling strength, the greater the reorganization energy is, which is not conducive to the charge transport. The greater the electron-electron interaction coupling strength, the greater the charge transfer matrix element is, which is beneficial to the charge transport. Charge transport properties of triphenylene derivative discogens molecules with a 1, 2, 3-triazole, 1, 2, 4-triazole or I. 2, 3-trinitrogen-2, 3-cyclopenten side chain are investigated computationally. The results show that the electronic mobility and the hole mobility of I, 2, 3-triazole triphenylene derivative are nearly equal, and the rate constant is 2 x 10(12) s(-1). The hole transfer rate constant of the 1, 2, 4-triazole triphenylene derivative molecules is 5 x 10(12) s(-1), which is ten times higer than the electronic transfer rate constant. Triphenylene containing 4, 5-dihydro-1, 2, 3-triazole has better electronic mobility but smaller hole mobility than triphenylene discogens containing 1, 2, 3-triazole or 1, 2, 4-triazole, and the electronic mobility is 3 x 10(12) s(-1), which is equal to ten times of the hole mobility. The hole transfer or electron transfer rate of the target molecules is affected mainly by the transfer matrix element, in other words, electron-electron interaction coupling strength determines the magnitude of mobility rate variation.

The results of XRD diffraction show that after the addition of K+, Ba2+, and Li+, a new Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3-based solid solution with a pure perovskite structure is obtained and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.10 < x < 0.20, 0.01 < y < 0.04, and z = 0.075. The partial substitutions of (Bi0.5K0.5)(2+), Ba2+, and (Bi0.5Li0.5)(2+) for the A-site (Bi0.5Na0.5)(2+) ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 decrease effectively the coercive field E-c and improve significantly the remanent polarization P-r. The piezoelectricity of the ceramics is greatly enhanced because of the MPB, lower E-c and higher P-r. The ceramic with x = 0.15, y = 0.02, and z = 0.075 situated at the MPB exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d(33) = 209 pC/N and k(p) = 30.5%. Two dielectric anomalies are observed, suggesting diffuse phase transition characteristics. The depolarization temperature T-d reaches a minimum value near the MPB. The deformed P-E loop is observed near/above T-d, indicating that the ceramics may contain both the polar and nonpolar regions. (C) 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Within the framework of the generalized master equation, we analyze the current, differential conductance and tunnel magnetoresistance versus bias for different electron correlations. Our results reveal that spin correlations can induce a giant tunnel magnetoresistance, while Coulomb correlations can lead to the occurrence of negative tunnel magetoresistance and negative differential conductance, and the relevant underlying physics of this problem is discussed.

The structure of the LiFePO4/C composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The micromorphology of the precursors and LiFePO4/C powders was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Laser particle analyzer and BET were also used to characterize the materials. It was found that the micromorphology, particle size distribution and specific surface area of LiFePO4/C composites were greatly influenced by the molecular weight of LiPAA. The electrochemical properties of the LiFePO4/C composites were evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and constant current charge/discharge cycling tests. The results showed that the molecular weight of LiPAA, heating rate, synthetic temperature and sintering duration directly affected the electrochemical properties of LiFePO4/C composites. The sample with the optimized electrochemical properties were obtained in the following conditions, i.e., LiPAA with the molecular weight of 20,000, heating rate of 10 A degrees C min(-1), synthetic temperature of 700 A degrees C and sintering duration of 15 h.

First, by using a minimax inequality, some new existence results of solutions and the behavior of solution set for the mixed equilibrium problems and the bilevel mixed equilibrium problems are proved under suitable assumptions without the coercive conditions. Next, by using auxiliary principle technique, some new iterative algorithms for solving the mixed equilibrium problems and the bilevel mixed equilibrium problems are suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the proposed algorithms is proved under suitable assumptions without the coercive conditions. These results are new and generalize some recent results in this field.

We assume that the spare system for replacement is available only by an order and the lead time for delivering the spare follows exponential distribution. Moreover, we also suppose that the repair facility may be subject to failure during the repair period. Under these assumptions, by using the geometric process and the supplementary variable technique, some important reliability indices such as the system availability, rate of occurrence of failure (ROCOF) and the probability that the system is waiting for replacement are derived. An ordering policy N - 1 and a replacement policy N based on the number of failures of the system are also considered. Furthermore, employing several Lemmas, the explicit expression of the average cost rate is derived. Meanwhile, the optimum value N* for minimizing the average cost rate could be determined numerically. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The modified Becke and Johnson potential is used to give a much more reasonable semiconductor gap. Our results demonstrate that ferromagnetic phase is always energetically favorable than the antiferromagnetic and nonmagnetic ones for all considered compounds. Magnetic moments are mainly attributed to the partly filled anionic p states. Especially, half-metallic ferromagnetism has been obtained for Ca- and Sr-doped AlAs, which may be promising for spintronic applications. The calculated results are also useful for understanding of the origin of ferromagnetism in diluted magnetic semiconductors. (C) 2012 American Institute of Physics.

Our data indicate that the calculated refractive-index of a perfect LiF crystal increases more rapidly with increasing pressure than those determined by shock experiments and above similar to 50-60 GPa there is also a similar behavior in density-pressure curve. It is found that Li-1 (+) vacancy-induced decreases in refractive-index and density are supposed to be a possible source causing these differences. Our results support that the vacancy-defect concentrations should increase with increasing shock-pressure. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[He, L.; Tang, M.

J	Lin, DM; Kwok, KW				Lin, Dunmin; Kwok, Kin Wing			Structure and piezoelectric properties of K0.5Na0.5NbO3-Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; SINTERING AID; TEMPERATURE	Lead-free (1-x) K0.5Na0.5NbO3-xBi(0.5)Li(0.5)TiO(3) + 1 mol% MnO2 piezoelectric ceramics have been prepared by a conventional ceramic technique and their structure and piezoelectric properties have been studied. Our results reveal that Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 diffuse into K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a perovskite structure. The addition of Bi0.5Li0.5TiO3 to the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 solid solution decreases the paraelectric cubic-ferroelectric tetragonal phase transition temperature (T (C)) slightly, but shifts the ferroelectric tetragonal-ferroelectric orthorhombic phase transition temperature (T (O-T)) significantly to low temperatures. As a result, coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.01 < x < 0.03 near room temperature, leading to a significant improvement in the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics. The ceramic with x = 0.025 exhibits a relatively high T (C) (392 A degrees C) and optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 191 pC/N, k (p) = 51.5% and k (t) = 45.5%. The ceramic also exhibit a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

The values of lattice constant, bulk modulus and its pressure derivatives and elastic constants are in excellent agreement with the available experimental data and other theoretical results. It is found that the ZB structure MN should be unstable above 20 GPa mechanically. The pressure and temperature dependencies of the bulk modulus, the heat capacity and the thermal expansion coefficient and the entropy S, as well as the Gruneisen parameter are obtained by the quasiharmonic Debye model in the ranges of 0-1500 K and 0-25 GPa.

It is shown that the two types of the Rayleigh range definitions are consistent in free space. However, in turbulence the Rayleigh range defined by the mean-squared beam width is smaller than that defined by the effective radius of curvature. The main results obtained in this paper are illustrated by numerical calculation examples, where partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian (PCH-G) beams are considered. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Our results reveal that the obtained Ca(1-3x/2)TbxWO4 microcrystallines are single-phase scheelite structure with tetragonal symmetry. The doping of Tb3+ inhibits the grain growth, decreases the intrinsic emission of WO42- complex ions and enhances the green emission of the microcrystallines. Moreover, the green emission intensity (lambda = 545 nm) of the as-synthesized Ca(1-3x/2)TbxWO4 microcrystallines phosphors increases with the increasing doping level of Tb3+ ions, giving the maximum value at x = 0.07.

One method of studying AD-related gene is to cluster similar genes together into a gene order. Gene order is a good clustering method as the results can be optimal globally while other clustering methods are only optimal locally. Herein we use the Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO)-based algorithm to calculate the gene order from an Alzheimer's DNA microarray dataset. We test it with four distance measurements: Pearson distance, Spearmen distance, Euclidean distance, and squared Euclidean distance. Our computing results indicate: a different distance formula generated a different quality of gene order the squared Euclidean distance approach produced the optimal AD-related gene order.

Let H = {R vertical bar R is a commutative ring with 1 not equal 0 and the nilradical n(R) is a divided prime ideal of R}. Let R is an element of H and let T(R) be the total quotient ring of R and define phi : T(R) -> R-n(R) by phi(a/b) = a/b for every a is an element of R and regular element b of R. A nonnil ideal I is a phi-w-ideal if phi(I) is a w-ideal of phi(R) and a phi-ring R is called a phi-SM ring if it satisfies the ascending chain condition on phi-w-ideals. We show that the theory of phi-SM rings resembles that of strong Mori domains.

It is shown that the decentred intensity distribution is amended gradually with increasing the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence, and it becomes an off-axis Gaussian-like beam when the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence become large enough. The centre of beam gravity is independent of both the propagation distance and the strength of turbulence. On the other hand, there are two intensity maxima, and their positions are symmetrical around the propagation z-axis when the propagation distance z is small. With increasing z, there is only one intensity maximum. As z further increases, position of the intensity maximum is further shifted towards the z-axis. When z is large enough, the position of the intensity maximum is unchanged. The unchanged position of the intensity maximum moves further away from the z-axis with an increase in the refraction index structure constant, the decentred parameter and the waist width.

Through a qualitative approach, a case study using semi-structured interview was employed to identify the crucial factors leading the users who do not use m-banking services to reject, postpone, or oppose them. Twenty non m-banking users from each country were interviewed and the data were analysed using qualitative content analysis with the software NVivo9. This study informs m-banking decision-makers of the significant inhibitors of m-banking services use and the characteristics of those who are classified as non-users. The results indicate that well developed traditional electronic banking services are significant barriers to m-banking services use. Perceived risk and lack of knowledge about m-banking contribute to non-use or rejection of m-banking services.

Although bilateral filter provides an efficient way to preserve image details while denoising, its performance in sinogram restoration for low-dosed X-ray computed tomography (LDCT) is unsatisfied. The main reason for this situation is that the range filter of the bilateral filter measures similarity by sinogram values, which are polluted seriously by noises and nonstationary artifacts of LDCT. In this paper, we propose a simple method to obtain satisfied restoration results for sinogram of LDCT. That is, the range filter weighs the similarity by Gaussian smoothed sinogram. Since smoothed sinogram can reduce the influence of both noises and nonstationary artifacts for similarity measurement greatly, our new method can provide more satisfied denoising results for sinogram restoration of LDCT. Experimental results show that our method has good visual quality and can preserve anatomy details in sinogram restoration even in both noises and nonstationary artifacts.

The singularities are detected by canny operator firstly and then dilated using mathematical morphology for finding pixels "near" singularities instead of "on" singularities. The denoising results for pixels near singularities are obtained by nonlocal means in spatial domain to preserve singularities while the denoising results for pixels in smooth regions are obtained by EM algorithm constrained by a mask formed by downsampled spatial image with dilated singularity prior to suiting the sizes of the subbands of wavelets. The final denoised results are got by combining the above two results. Experimental results show that the scheme can preserve singularity well with relatively high PSNR and good visual quality.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme, named Fractal-order Perona-Malik Diffusion (FPMD), which replaces the integer-order derivative of the Perona-Malik (PM) Diffusion with the fractional-order derivative using G-L fractional derivative. FPMD, which is a interpolation between integer-order Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion (NAD) and fourth-order partial differential equations, provides a more flexible way to balance the noise reducing and anatomical details preserving. Smoothing results for phantoms and real sinograms show that FPMD with suitable parameters can suppress the staircase effects and speckle effects efficiently. In addition, FPMD also has a good performance in visual quality and root mean square errors (RMSE).

In particular, high achievement motive is associated with subsequent economic growth, which in turn increases power motive. Increased national achievement and power motives have been argued to precede social changes that lead to decreased affiliation motives, and engagement in wars. The present study aimed to examine differences in achievement, power, and affiliation motives between 266 college students in China (a nation with sustained high economic growth) and 255 college students in the USA (a nation with previously strong but now slowing economic growth, and engaged in war). Analysis of personal strivings suggested that Chinese college students showed significantly higher levels of achievement motive than the American college students, but American college students showed significantly higher levels of affiliation motive than Chinese college students. Overall, males exhibited higher achievement motivation than females. No significant interaction effects were found for gender by location for any of the three motives. The findings are discussed in relation to previous research.

We also tested the reliability and validity of a Chinese version of the Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist Civilian Version (Weathers, Litz, Huska, & Keane, 1994) with this group. PTSD occurred more frequently among females compared with males, and among those exposed directly, indirectly, or not at all to the earthquake, the highest incidence of PTSD was among the group exposed directly. Among 3 groups aged between 11 and 13, 14 and 15, and 16 and 18, the highest incidence of PTSD was in students aged 14 and 15. Compared with other groups those with the highest incidence of PTSD were students with low socioeconomic status, who witnessed the earthquake, had heavy loss of their houses and other possessions, and whose family members were casualties. Factor analysis showed that the 3-factor model of the PCL-C had good construct validity. The internal consistency of Cronbach's alpha and split-half reliability was also satisfactory. Therefore, the PCL-C was determined to be a reliable instrument to detect PTSD among Chinese adolescents exposed to the earthquake.

The results show that two structures are stable under high pressure and the incompressibility increases with pressure. In addition, the electron structures, the total and the partial densities of states are also calculated. BC5 is found to be metallic with band gap, unlike other B-C compounds. The material properties of BC5 are mainly determined by B 2p(1) and C 2p(2) electronic states together. All these show that BC5 is an unusual super hard material, and it may be a potential candidate for diamond at high temperature. The given density of states indicates the covalent hybridization between B and C atoms in this compound. The pressure slightly influences the density of states and the band gap, indicating stability under high pressure. We also find that pressure has no influence on the density of states near Fermi level and the band gap, except for slight shifts of the bands. It can be further inferred that BC5 will have good stability under high pressure.

After establishing a characterization of epsilon-subdifferential of the minimal time function, we obtain that the limiting subdifferential of the minimal time function is representable by virtue of the corresponding normal cones of sublevel sets of the function and level or sublevel sets of the support function of U.

We calculate the density of states in this system by solving Green function. Our results reveal that the density of states show some noticeable characteristics not only depending upon the interdot coupling t(ab), the energy level epsilon(d1) of the side coupled quantum dot QD(b), and the relative angle theta of magnetic moment M, but also the asymmetry parameter a in ferromagnetic leads and so on. All these parameters greatly influence the density of states of the central quantum dot QD(a). This system is a possible candidate for spin valve transistors and may have potential applications in the spintronics.

In vitro antioxidant activities of FPR were investigated through hydroxyl and superoxide radical scavenging activities. In vivo anti-fatigue activity of FPR was investigated through loaded swimming exercise of mice. Results showed that FPR had not only in vitro antioxidant activities, but also an in vivo anti-fatigue activity in mice. FPR possessed superoxide and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity in in vitro experimental studies. In vivo experimental studies, FPR could evidently extend exhaustive swimming time of mice, inhibit the increase of blood lactic acid (BLA), decrease serum urea nitrogen (BUN) and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents, promote increases in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) of mice after swimming. The results provided an important basis for developing the FPR as a novel antioxidant and anti-fatigue compound.

Following the idea of Moudafi, we consider a system of generalized equations problems and show its equivalence with the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems. By using a fixed point formulation of the system of generalized equation problems, a new iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems is suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new and unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

J	Lin, DM; Kwok, KW				Lin, Dunmin; Kwok, Kin Wing			Phase transition, dielectric and piezoelectric properties of K0.5Na0.5NbO3-CaTi0.9Zr0.1O3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE			English	Article							ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES	Lead-free (1 - x)K0.5Na0.5NbO3-xCaTi(0.9)Zr(0.1)O(3) + 0.75 mol%MnO2 piezoelectric ceramics have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their phase transition, dielectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction show that CaTi0.9Zr0.1O3 diffuse into K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a perovskite structure. After the addition of CaTi0.9Zr0.1O3, both the cubic-tetragonal and tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition temperatures decrease, and a relaxor behavior is induced. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is formed in the ceramics with 0.03 < x < 0.07 at room temperature. Owing to the higher number of possible polarization states resulting from the coexistence of the two phases, the piezoelectric properties of the ceramics are enhanced significantly. The ceramic with x = 0.05 exhibits the following optimum properties: d (33) = 203 pC/N, k (p) = 45.0%, and T (C) = 342 A degrees C.

Here, enzyme catalysis acrylonitrile reaction was carried out and the coupled multiphysics field equations were solved by finite difference time domain (FDTD) method. The temperature curves can be obtained under the different power. Then, the results calculated by chemical reaction kinetic show that the power window of product concentration can be induced by thermal effect.

This paper aims to make a comparative study of the 2 models. Rough set regions, primitive notions, are proposed first for the 2 models, which classify the universe more precisely. Then, both of their logical meanings related to quantitative indexes and their basic structure are investigated, and their precise descriptions are obtained as well. Furthermore, in the graded rough set model, macroscopic and microscopic algorithms are proposed and analyzed to calculate rough set regions; then, the conclusion is drawn that macroscopic and microscopic algorithms have advantages in time and space complexities, respectively, and a medical example is provided to illustrate the rough set regions and the 2 algorithms. In addition, 3 new properties of the 2 models are investigated, which are the results of extending the classical rough set model, i.e. the relationships between approximations and the basic set, the power actions of approximation operators, and the modifications of approximation operator actions on set operations. Finally, the classical rough set model is used to obtain many corresponding results, and moreover, the relationship and transformation between the 2 models is investigated. The study results of this paper have extended and enriched rough set theory from both operator-oriented and set-oriented points of view. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Wang, SY; Zhang, B; Yang, CJ; Zhao, Y; Wang, H				Wang, Siyuan; Zhang, Bing; Yang, Cunjian; Zhao, Yan; Wang, Hui			Temporal change and suitability assessment of cropland in the Yellow River Basin during 1990-2005	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SCIENCE			English	Article						cropland suitability assessment; remote sensing (RS); geographical information system (GIS); Yellow River Basin	LAND-USE CHANGE; SPATIAL-PATTERN; LOESS PLATEAU; CHINA; LANDSCAPE; GIS; AREA	Rapid landscape pattern change has taken place in many arid and semi-arid regions of China such as Yellow River Basin over the past decade. In this article, the physical suitability of cropland and its change were evaluated and analyzed by the combined use of satellite remote sensing, geographical information system, and landscape modeling technologies. The aim was to improve our understanding of cropland change so that sustainable cropland utilization could be established. First, the spatial pattern change of cropland was analyzed using the 1-km(2) area percentage model; second, the numerical model for cropland suitability assessment was explored and developed using analytical hierarchy process analysis method. Using this model, cropland suitability index was computed for the whole of the basin from 1990 to 2005. The cropland suitability index was classified into five levels: better, good, middle, bad, and worse, following the natural breaks classification. The spatial distribution of cropland suitability level and its changes over the 15 years from 1990 to 2005 were analyzed and the driving factors of cropland change were investigated. The results showed that the cropland suitability in the study area was at good level, and the cropland quality had been gradually improved on the whole. However, the cropland quality had become worse over the 15 years in some regions. In the study area, governmental policies for eco-environmental protection and population growth were found to be the major factors that caused the cropland change over the past 15 years.

Firstly, we establish a global existenceuniqueness theorem for the IDSDEs under the global Lipschitz condition in C without the linear growth condition. Secondly, the non-continuable solution for IDSDEs is given under the local Lipschitz condition in C. Then, the classical ItO's formula is improved and a global existence theorem for IDSDEs is obtained. Our new theorems give better results while conditions imposed are much weaker than some existing results. For example, we need only the local Lipschitz condition in C but neither the linear growth condition nor the continuous condition on the time t. Finally, two examples are provided to show the effectiveness of the theoretical results.

This study constructed a novel insert-type air-cathode microbial fuel cell (ITAC-MFC) as an alternative to a sediment-type MFC and a two-chambered MFC for the generation of bioelectricity and the degradation of sewage sludge organic matter. Meanwhile, a pH adjustment was carried out to enhance substrate bioavailability of sludge and to suppress methane production in the MFC. RESULTS: A maximum power density of 73 +/- 5 mW m(-2) was obtained at sludge pH 10.0, much higher than those of 33 +/- 3 and 4 +/- 0.5 mW m(-2) obtained at pH 8.0 and 6.0, respectively. It was observed that the soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) of sewage sludge at pH 10.0 was almost three times greater than that at pH 6.0. At the same time, the total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD) removal and coulombic efficiency (CE) at pH 10.0 were also much higher than at the other two conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that improved electricity production and organic degradation could be achieved by maintaining the sludge pH at 10.0 in an MFC. ITAC-MFC offers an attractive alternative for the environmentally-friendly removal of organic matter in sewage sludge.

Two kinds of hydrogen bonds with different strength are involved in the multi-component self-assembly, one is H-bond between carboxyl group of sym-TTT and melamine, the other is intermolecular H-bond between melamine molecules. These interactions drive a structural transformation from close-packed network to hexagonal network with active amino groups inside of the cavity. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements reveal that the functionalized network of sym-TTT/melamine could recognise Fe3+. These results could be helpful for designing functionalized molecular networks by multi-component self-assembling strategy.

The homogenous patch, composed by homogenous points, is formed by the points similar to the center point using similarity sorting, similarity decreasing searching, and variance analysis in a very large neighborhood (VLN) to avoid manual selection of parameter for similarity measures. Homogenous pixels in the VLN allow us find the largest number of samples, who have the highest similarities to the center point, for noise estimation, and the noise level can be estimated according to unbiased estimation. Experimental results show that for the simulated noisy sinograms, the method proposed in this paper can obtain satisfied noise estimation results, especially for sinograms with relatively serious noises.

The bonding processing, adsorption energy, dynamic track, and diffusion coefficient are investigated. The results indicate that the adsorption process may be divided into four stages: physical adsorption, chemical adsorption early stage, chemical adsorption late stage, and the superficial stable state. The Si=O structure, the Si-O-Si surface oxygen-bridge structure, and the Si-O-Si oxygen-bridge structure where oxygen atoms are inserted into the backbonds between the surface and the second layer of silicon atoms in the stable adsorption structures, are beneficial to the formation of the silica tetrahedral structure. We conclude that the remarkable difference between the diffusion coefficients during the physical adsorption stage leads to different diffusion paths, which results in the formation of two concomitant stable structures in the early process of silicon surface oxidation.

A system of auxiliary mixed equilibrium problems (SAMEP) for solving the SGMEP is introduced and the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of the SAMEP is first proved. Next, by using the auxiliary principle technique, a new iterative algorithm to compute the approximate solutions of the SGMEP is suggested and analyzed. Finally, the strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is also proved under quite mild conditions. These results improve, unify and generalize some known results in recent literature. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Magnetic reversal processes and critical thickness in FePt/alpha-Fe/FePt trilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Nucleation field; Hysteresis loop; Critical thickness	EXCHANGE-COUPLED NANOLAYERS; NUCLEATION; COERCIVITY	Magnetic reversal processes of a FePt/alpha-Fe/FePt trilayer system with in-plane easy axes have been investigated within a micromagnetic approach. It is found that the magnetic reversal process consists of three steps: nucleation of a prototype of domain wall in the soft phase, the evolution as well as the motion of the domain wall from the soft to the hard phase and finally, the magnetic reversal of the hard phase. For small soft layer thickness L(s), the three steps are reduced to one single step, where the magnetizations in the two phases reverses simultaneously and the hysteresis loops are square with nucleation as the coercivity mechanism. As L(s) increases, both nucleation and pinning fields decrease. In the meantime, the single-step reversal expands to a standard three-step one and the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning. The critical thickness where the coercivity mechanism alters, could be derived analytically, which is found to be inversely proportional to the square root of the crystalline anisotropy of the hard phase. Such a scaling law might provide an easy way to test the present theory. Further increase of L(s) leads to the change of the coercivity mechanism from pinning to nucleation. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

First, an auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problem (AGMEP) is introduced to compute the approximate solutions of the BGMEP involving the GMVLIPs. By using a minimax inequality, the existence and the uniqueness of solutions of the AGMEP are proved under mild conditions without any coercive assumptions. By using an auxiliary principle technique, the new iterative algorithms are proposed and analyzed, with which the approximate solutions of the BGMEP are computed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequence generated by the algorithms is shown under mild conditions without any coercive assumptions. These new results can generalize some recent results in this field.

First, it introduces the notion of an irredundant decomposition of an element in a join-semiring, then discusses the cardinality of a basis and proves that the cardinality of each basis is n if and only if the multiplicative identity element 1 is join-irreducible. If 1 is not a join-irreducible element then each basis need not have the same number of elements in semilinear spaces of n-dimensional vectors over join-semirings.

The Laplacian Estrada index of a graph G is defined as LEE(G) = Sigma(n)(i=1) e(mu i) where mu(1), mu(2), ... , mu(n) are the Laplacian eigenvalues of G. An edge grafting operation on a graph moves a pendent edge between two pendent paths. We study the change of Estrada index of graph under edge grafting operation between two pendent paths at two adjacent vertices. As the application, we give the result on the change of Laplacian Estrada index of bipartite graph under edge grafting operation between two pendent paths at the same vertex. We also determine the unique tree with minimum Laplacian Estrada index among the set of trees with given maximum degree, and the unique trees with maximum Laplacian Estrada indices among the set of trees with given diameter, number of pendent vertices, matching number, independence number and domination number, respectively.

The surface composition, crystalline components and morphology of V6O13 were characterized by X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurements, respectively. An intercalating-exfoliatingself- assembly model was proposed to explain the formation process of hollow-flower structure based on experimental results. The obtained hollow flowers-like V6O13 exhibits high specific capacitance, good cyclability and low resistance as revealed by analysis of cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). Experimental results also indicate that hollow flowers-like V6O13 can deliver a capacitance of 417 F g(-1) at a scan rate of 5 mV s(-1). This value would decrease to 400 F g(-1) after 1000 cycles in potential range from 0 to 0.8 V versus saturated calomel electrode (SCE) in 1 mol L-1 NaNO3 aqueous electrolyte at pH of 2.

It is shown that general truncated beams may have the same directionality as a fully coherent Gaussian beam if a certain condition is satisfied. Taking a truncated sinh-Gaussian beam as an example of general truncated beams, some numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the general results obtained in this paper. The analytic results obtained in this paper are general and very useful in studying the propagation property and the beam quality of laser beams.

J	Yan, CH; Wei, LF; Jia, WZ; Shen, JT				Yan, Cong-Hua; Wei, Lian-Fu; Jia, Wen-Zhi; Shen, Jung-Tsung			Controlling resonant photonic transport along optical waveguides by two-level atoms	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							SPONTANEOUS EMISSION; QUANTUM; CAVITY	Recent works [Shen et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 213001 (2005); Zhou et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 100501 (2008)] showed that the incident photons cannot transmit along an optical waveguide containing a resonant two-level atom (TLA). Here we propose an approach to overcome such a difficulty by using asymmetric couplings between the photons and a TLA. Our numerical results show that the transmission spectrum of the photon depends on both the frequency of the incident photons and the photon-TLA couplings. Consequently, this system can serve as a controllable photon attenuator, by which the transmission probability of the resonantly incident photons can be changed from 0% to 100%. A possible application to explain the recent experimental observations [Astafiev et al., Science 327, 840 (2010)] is also discussed.

After obtaining some a priori estimates, we prove under certain natural conditions that the solutions to the Cauchy problem of the vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations in two and three spatial dimensions blow up in a finite time. Assuming that a solution to the aforementioned vector nonlinear Schrodinger equations is radially symmetric with respect to spatial variables x, we show that if the initial energy is non-positive, then the solution blows up in three dimensions in a finite time.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL				Li Xiao-Qing; Ji Xiao-Ling			Generalized M-G(2) factor of truncated partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beam	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						truncated partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian beam; generalized M-G(2) factor; generalized truncated second - order moments	M-2 FACTOR; PROPAGATION FACTOR	Based on the method of generalized truncated second-order moment, the analytical formula of the generalized beam propagation factor (M-G(2) factor) of truncated partially coherent Hermite-Gaussian (H-G) beams is derived. The analytical results obtained from truncated fully coherent H-G beam, truncated Gaussian Shell Model (GSM) beam and truncated Gaussian beam are given as particular examples in this paper. It is shown that the M-G(2), factor of truncated partially coherent H-G beam depends on truncated parameter delta, beam order m, and beam coherence parameter alpha. When the value of delta is very small, the odd-even groups happen to the M-G(2) factor, i. e. , the values of M-G(2) factor with different values of the odd m are nearly the same, and so are they for the even m case. However, this phenomenon disappears as delta increases. For the truncated GSM beams with different values of delta, there exist the cross points between the curves of the M-G(2), factor versus alpha. However, this phenomenon may disappear for truncated partially coherent H-G beams. In addition, the larger the m is, the more the M-G(2) factor is affected by the delta, and the effect of aperture on M-G(2), factor may be neglected when the delta is larger.

Seven hundred parental dyads recruited through schools in Chengdu, China, completed the Chinese version of the Children's Attitudes and Behaviors towards Animals scale. Mothers and fathers of boys reported more cruel behaviors towards animals on the part of their child than did mothers and fathers of girls. The correlations between mothers' and fathers' reports were significant, but moderate, but parents of boys' reports were more consistent than those of parents of girls. No gender-of-parent by gender-of-child effect was found, and fathers of boys reported significantly higher levels of total cruelty than did the boys' mothers.

Five candidate structures are chosen to investigate for OsN2, namely, the pyrite, CoSb2-type, marcasite, simple hexagonal and tetragonal structures. A comparison among the formation energies of OsN2 explains the synthesis of OsN2 marcasite under high pressure. On the basis of the third-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure P-t (P-t = 223 GPa) between the marcasite and simple tetragonal phase is determinated. Elastic constants, shear modulus, Young's modulus, Poisson's ratio and Debye temperature are derived. The calculated values are, generally speaking, in good agreement with experiments and other theoretical calculations. Our calculation indicates that the N-N bond length is one determinative factor for the ultrahigh bulk moduli of the heavy-transition-metal dinitrides. Moreover, based on Mulliken overlap population analysis in first-principles technique, a semiempirical method to evaluate the hardness of multicomponent crystals with partial metallic bonding is presented. The effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of OsN2 is investigated and the hardness shows a gradual decrease rather than increase under compression, which is different from diamond. This is a quantitative investigation on the structural properties of OsN2, and it still awaits experimental confirmation.

Furthermore, the ring-openings have been found in the longer N-N single bond by analyzing the length change of N-N bond of ring-shaped isomers in ring-opening processes. In addition, with the activation energies in ring-opening processes, the differences of the activation energies in isomerization between the isomers have been found according to the classification of rings. The activation energies in ring-opening isomerization of six-membered ring-shaped isomers are higher than that of the four-membered ring-shaped isomers. It indicates that six-membered ring-shaped isomers difficult in ring-opening in the isomerization are the steadiest ring-shaped isomers of N8H8 while four-membered ring-shaped isomers easy in ring-opening are the most unstable.

J	Mo, Y; Wang, XP				Mo, Yan; Wang, Xue-ping			An improved algorithm on the content of realizable fuzzy matrices	SOFT COMPUTING			English	Article						Relation; Realizable fuzzy matrix; Content; Algorithm	DECOMPOSITION PROBLEM	An nxn fuzzy matrix A is called realizable if there exists an nxt fuzzy matrix B such that A = B circle dot B(T); where circle dot is the max-min composition. Let r(A) = min{p : A = B circle dot BT; B is an element of L(nxp)}: Then r(A) is called the content of A. Since 1982, how to calculate r(A) for a given nxn realizable fuzzy matrix A was a focus problem, many researchers have made a lot of research work. X. P. Wang in 1999 gave an algorithm to find the fuzzy matrix B and calculate r(A) within [r(A)](n2) steps. Therefore, to find a simpler algorithm is a problem what we have to consider. This paper makes use of the symmetry of the realizable fuzzy matrix A to simplify the algorithm of content r(A) based on the work of Wang (Chin Ann Math A 6: 701-706, 1999).

LD50 were tested by mice's abdominal cavity injection in order to evaluate their structure-activity relationships. The results indicated that the derivatives exhibited high antimicrobial activities than coptisine, especially against Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. The 8-octylcoptisine displayed the highest antimicrobial activity in all compounds. The toxicity of compounds 2-6 was stronger than that of coptisine. However, upon elongating the aliphatic chain, the toxicity decreased gradually.

When the first phase of service is completed, the service process can be interrupted with probability 1 - p (0 <= p <= 1) as a result of the customer leaving the service area to attend to other work. There is a finite space to accommodate the interrupted customers in the queueing system. When the other work is completed, the customer, whose service was interrupted, will re-enter the service area and resume his interrupted service based on the non-preemptive priority rule. Using the matrix geometric method, the steady state behavior of this system is analyzed. Based on the queue length distribution, several important performance measures along with some numerical examples have been discussed. Finally, under a given cost structure, we use the direct search method to determine the optimal capacity of the space to accommodate the interrupted customers. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Six functionalized triphenylene discotic monomers were prepared, and then Pd-catalyzed homo-coupling reaction was used for the preparation of symmetrical discotic liquid crystal dimers, (RO)(5)C(18)H(6)(O(2)CC(6)H(4)C equivalent to C-C equivalent to CC(6)H(4)CO(2))C(18)H(6)(OR)(5) (R=C(n)H(2n+1), n=4 similar to 9), for which two triphenylene discogens was connected via a rigid spacer. The purity and structure of the new compounds was confirmed by using (1)H NMR, IR and high resolution mass. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) results show that the dimers have good thermal stability, beginning to decompose at 370 degrees C. Polarized optical microscopy (POM) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) results display that the monomers and dimers exhibit columnar mesophases. The dimers display wide mesophase range and are room temperature liquid crystals. The clearing points of dimers increase with the lengthening of peripheral alkyl chain, while the monomers show opposite trend.

Through the current calculations, the density of states (DOS), energy band structure and optical absorption coefficients have been obtained for TiO2 and compared with the doped TiO2, and the influence of electronic structure and optical properties caused by Zr and C co-doping has been presented qualitatively together. The results revealed that the energy band gap has been decreased owing to the doped Zr and C, whereas the optical absorption coefficients have been increased in the region of 400 similar to 800 nm and a red shift of absorption band can be found. Accordingly, photo catalytic activity of TiO2 has been enhanced. The current calculations are in good agreement with the experimental data.

The calculated results obtained by the complete diagonalization method are close to that obtained by the perturbation theory method, and in good agreement with the experimental values. In the complete diagonalization method, the complete diagonalization procedure is established based on the 3d(9) electron system in tetragonal field. From the calculation of the electron paramagnetic resonance parameters, the local defect structure of the [CuO(6)](-10) cluster can be determined as D(4h) with R(x) = R(y) = 0.1952 nm, R(z) = 0.2076 nm.

Our calculations include the variation of band structure with the parameters for the sublayers, and the energy dispersion relations. It is found that by varying the sublayer thickness, the band structures can be well designed in different ways. The strain will change the bandgaps, reduce the band offsets and the sub-bands obviously, and make the valence band more complex. In comparison with the experimental results, our model is rather suited for simulating the narrow-quantum-well structures, while for the wide-quantum-well structures, the build-in field should be considered.

We compute all attribute reductions using the vague-rough lower approximation distribution, concepts of attribute reduction and the discernibility matrix in a vague decision information system (VDIS). Research results for extracting decision rules from the VDIS show the proposed approaches extend the corresponding method in classical rough set theory and provide a new avenue to uncertain vague knowledge acquisition.

The results show that the linear polarization state and the symmetry of beam cannot remain unchanged during propagation due to the anisotropy of crystals.

The effects of Co and/or Sn doping on surface morphologies and mircrostructures of ZnO films are investigated by metallurgical microscope and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The XRD results indicate that all the ZnO samples show preferential orientation along the (002) direction, and that the Sn-doped ZnO thin film exhibits the best c-axis orientation and largest grain size. XPS results reveal that Co and Sn elements exist as Co2+ and Sn4+, indicating that Co and Sn ions have entered into the ZnO crystal lattices successfully. Strong blue double emission and weak green emission are observed in the PL spectra of all the samples. In addition, the ultraviolet peaks appear in the undoped and the Co-doped ZnO thin films. Our results reveal that the Co and/or Sn doping can tune the band gap, meanwhile, such a doping can also affect oxygen dislocation, zinc oxygen and zinc interstial defect concentrations. Finally, the possible luminescence mechanisms of Co and/or Sn doped ZnO films are discussed.

However, the geometric shape of these manifolds is largely unclear. The purpose of the present paper is to try to describe the geometric shape of invariant manifolds for a class of stochastic partial differential equations with multiplicative white noises. The local geometric shape of invariant manifolds is approximated, which holds with significant likelihood.

Propagation properties of apertured laser beams with amplitude modulations and phase fluctuations through atmospheric turbulence	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article; Proceedings Paper	Spring Meeting of the AMOP-Section of the German-Physical-Society	MAR 08-12, 2010	Hannover, GERMANY	German Phys Soc, AMOP Sect			FLAT-TOPPED BEAMS; GAUSSIAN BEAMS; COHERENT; DIRECTIONALITY; INTENSITY; SYSTEM	The propagation properties of apertured laser beams with amplitude modulations (AMs) and phase fluctuations (PFs) through atmospheric turbulence are studied in detail both analytically and numerically. The analytical expressions for the average intensity, power in the bucket (PIB) and Strehl ratio (S (R) ) of apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs propagating through atmospheric turbulence are derived. It is found that the worse the phase fluctuation and the higher the amplitude modulation are, the less laser beams are affected by turbulence. Furthermore, apertured Gaussian beams are more sensitive to turbulence than apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs. The average intensity of apertured laser beams with AMs and PFs may be even larger than that of apertured Gaussian beams due to turbulence. In particular, the influence of turbulence on the average maximum intensity of apertured laser beams with PFs and AMs may become serious if an unsuitable truncated parameter is chosen, which should be avoided in practice.

We present a systematic investigation of optical properties of BC5 in P3m1 and I-4m2 phases at ambient and high pressure in the framework of density functional theory with the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in this paper. Optical properties such as dielectric function, refractive index, absorption, reflectivity and electron energy-loss spectrum are obtained successfully. The feature in the spectra of the optical parameters is discussed. Through calculation, we find BC5 is optically anisotropic. Moreover, the dielectric function exhibits a large change at 70 GPa pressure for P3m1 BC5 phase, but I-4m2 phase not, indicating the stable electronic structure that the I-4m2 phase possesses.

Eleven stable structures of the catechin-cytosine complexes have been found respectively. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes which were corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), are from -17.35 to -43.27 kJ/mol. The results show that the hydrogen bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all the complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in good agreement with experimental results.

It is found that the nucleation field H (N) decreases uniformly as the size of the soft phase L (s) increases whereas it increases with the size of the hard phase L (h) . The analysis shows that whilst the effect of L (h) could be ignored in most cases, where the nucleation field is dominated by the L (s) and the calculation could be significantly simplified, the overly simple inverse square law between H (N) and the soft layer thickness L (s) adopted by the previous researchers is not a good approximation. While nucleation is the beginning of the magnetic reversal, pinning is the dominant coercivity mechanism in both two-phased and single-phased magnetic materials, where the crystalline defects exist. Comparison with the experimental data confirms this conclusion, indicating that Brown's paradox results from the much lower effective anisotropy in both single-phased and composite materials, as speculated in the literature.

The server in the system is assumed to provide two different types of services, namely essential and optional services, to the customer. During the operation of the system, the arrival of the catastrophe will break the system down and simultaneously induce customer to leave the system immediately. Using a new type discrete supplementary variable technique, the authors obtain some performance characteristics of the queueing system, including the steady-state availability and failure frequency of the system, the steady-state probabilities for the server being idle, busy, breakdown and the loss probability of the system etc. Finally, by the numerical examples, the authors study the influence of the system parameters on several performance measures.

Taking the Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) beam as a typical example of partially coherent beams, the analytical formula of the M-2-factor of truncated GSM beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence is derived. It is shown that the M-2-factor decreases as the truncation parameter delta and the coherence parameter a increase. However, the M-2-factor in turbulence is more sensitive to delta than that in free space. On the other hand, the M-2-factor of truncated partially coherent beams with smaller delta is more affected by turbulence. In addition, the effect of turbulence on the M-2-factor of truncated GSM beams is less sensitive to the coherence parameter a than that of nontruncated GSM beams.

Squeezing and entanglement of a two-mode field in a four-level tripod atomic system	OPTICS COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Squeezing; Entanglement; Electromagnetically induced transparency	ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; ENSEMBLES	The interaction of a collection of N four-level tripod configuration atoms with two orthogonally polarized probe fields is investigated. Under the condition of electromagnetically induced transparency (Err), we calculate the squeezing and entanglement spectra of the output probe fields. By analyzing the output spectrum, we find that the squeezing and entanglement of the probe fields can be well-preserved after passing through the optically thick medium. Additionally, the effects of the ground state dephasing rates of the atoms on the entanglement and squeezing of the output two-mode squeezed fields are investigated. It is shown that the dephasing rates will degrade the entanglement and squeezing, and these quantum properties can be lost when the dephasing rates increase up to a certain value. This will be useful in the quantum computation and quantum communication. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Ding, J. L.; Hou, B.

J	Ji, XL				Ji Xiao-Ling			Influence of turbulence on the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						Rayleigh range; partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beam; atmospheric turbulence; free space	PROPAGATION	The analytical expressions for the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams both in free space and in atmospheric turbulence are derived. The influence of turbulence on the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams is studied. It is shown that the Rayleigh range of partially coherent cosh-Gaussian beams depends on the strength of turbulence and the beam parameters. The Rayleigh range decreases due to turbulence. The stronger the turbulence, the shorter the Rayleigh range is. In free space, the Rayleigh range increases with the increase of beam coherence parameter alpha, beam parameter beta and Gaussian waist width w(0), and the decrease of wave length lambda. However, the Rayleigh range is less sensitive to turbulence with alpha, beta and w(0) decreasing and A increasing. Furthermore, the influence of turbulence can be ignored when alpha, beta and w(0) are small enough and A is large enough.

The physical characteristics of Li4Ti5O12/C composites were investigated by X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, particle size distribution and thermogravimetry-derivative thermogravimetry techniques. Their electrochemical properties were characterized by cyclic voltammograms, electrochemical impedance spectra, constant current charge-discharge and rate charge-discharge. These analyses indicated that the carbon source and carbon content have a great effect on the physical and electrochemical performances of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. An ideal carbon source and appropriate carbon content effectively improved the electrical contact between the Li4Ti5O12 particles, which enhanced the discharge capacity and rate capability of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. PAA was the best carbon source for the synthesis of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. When the carbon content was 3.49 wt.% (LiOH center dot H2O/PAA molar ratio of 1), as-prepared Li4Ti5O12/C showed the maximum discharge capacity. At 0.2 C. initial capacity of the optimized sample was 168.6 mAh g(-1) with capacity loss of 2.8% after 50 cycles. At 8 and 10 C, it showed discharge capacities of 143.5 and 132.7 mAh g(-1), with capacity loss of 8.7 and 9.9% after 50 cycles, respectively. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Compared with the ion-substituted hole-type LaCoO3 systems (e.g., La1-xSrxCoO3), the thermal conduction of La1-xCoO3-y is noticeably reduced by the La/O vacancies, whereas the electric transport is less influenced, which results in an efficient ZT enhancement. We demonstrate that the large thermal conductivity reduction originates from the strong point-defect scattering, and La1-xCoO3-y can be rationalized as a partially filled solid solution: La1-x square xCoO3-y square(y), where square denotes a vacancy. Such intrinsic thermal conductivity suppression provides an effective pathway for the design of better TE materials.

The calculated results show that the La doping increases the bandgap of ZnO, in agreement with the experimental results; while the Fermi level shifts into the conduction band, revealing the so-called Burstein-Moss effect. In comparison to pure ZnO, a new peak appears in the imaginary part of dielectric function in the system doped with La and the optical absorption edge has been obviously changed. Moreover, the covalent property of Zn1-xLaxO is found to weaken with the increase of La concentration. (C) 2011 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The LiFePO4/C composite with the particle size of similar to 200 nm shows better discharge capacity (156.4 mAh g(-1)) than bare LiFePO4 (52.3 mAh g(-1)) at 0.2 C due to the improved electronic conductivity which is demonstrated by EIS. The as-prepared LiFePO4/C through this method also shows excellent high-rate characteristic and cycle performance. The initial discharge capacity of the sample is 120.5 mAh g(-1) and the capacity retention rate is 100.6% after 50 cycles at 5 C rate. The results prove that the using of organic lithium salts can obtain a high performance LiFePO4/C composite. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Accurate calculation of the nucleation field and hysteresis loops in hard-soft multilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							MAGNETS	In this paper, the nucleation field H-N, hysteresis loops, and coercivity mechanism for hard/soft multilayers have been investigated within a self-contained micromagnetic model, which change with the strength of the interface exchange coupling J(i) as well as the thickness of the hard and soft layers L h and L-s. Analyses show that the nucleation field goes up as the interface exchange coupling increases. However, J(i) has a significant effect on HN only when L-s is about 10% of the domain wall width of the soft phase while the thickness of the hard layer is larger than its domain wall width. The hysteresis loops of the Nd2Fe14B/alpha-Fe/Nd2Fe14B trilayers for various J(i) have been calculated. The calculated pinning field decreases when J(i) increases. It is found that, as L-s increases, the coercivity mechanism changes from pinning to nucleation. The change of exchange coupling at the interface influences the soft layer thickness, at which the coercivity starts to deviate from pinning. The critical thickness of the soft phase, at which the behavior of the hysteresis loop changes from the single-phased one to the two-phased one, decreases as J(i) decreases, so that the "rigid composite magnet" appears only when L-s is very small for smaller J(i).

I. SPECTRAL COMPONENTS AND THE POSSIBLE PHYSICAL ORIGINS OF LAT/GBM GRBs	ASTROPHYSICAL JOURNAL			English	Article						gamma-ray burst: general	HIGH-ENERGY EMISSION; INVERSE COMPTON EMISSION; INTERNAL SHOCK MODEL; DELAYED GEV EMISSION; PROMPT EMISSION; AFTERGLOW EMISSION; BATSE OBSERVATIONS; THERMAL EMISSION; SPACE-TELESCOPE; EXTERNAL MATTER	We present a systematic analysis of the spectral and temporal properties of 17 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) codetected by the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and the Large Area Telescope (LAT) onboard the Fermi satellite in 2010 May. We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of all the bursts, with the finest temporal resolution allowed by statistics, to reduce temporal smearing of different spectral components. We found that the time-resolved spectra of 14 out of 17 GRBs are best modeled with the classical "Band" function over the entire Fermi spectral range, which may suggest a common origin for emissions detected by the LAT and GBM. GRB 090902B and GRB 090510 require the superposition of an MeV component and an extra power-law component, with the former having a sharp cutoff above E-p. For GRB 090902B, this MeV component becomes progressively narrower as the time bin gets smaller, and can be fit with a Planck function as the time bin becomes small enough. In general, we speculate that, phenomenologically, there may be three elemental spectral components that shape the time-resolved GRB spectra: a Band-function component (e. g., in GRB 080916C) that extends over a wide energy range and does not narrow with decreasing time bins, which may be of non-thermal origin; a quasi-thermal component (e. g., in GRB 090902B), with spectra progressively narrowing with reducing time bins; and another non-thermal power-law component extending to high energies. The spectra of different bursts may be decomposed into one or more of these elemental components. We compare this sample with the Burst and Transient Source Experiment sample and investigate some correlations among spectral parameters. We discuss the physical implications of the data analysis results for GRB prompt emission, including jet composition (matter-dominated versus Poynting-flux-dominated outflow), emission sites (internal shock, external shock, or photosphere), as well as radiation mechanisms (synchrotron, synchrotron self-Compton, or thermal Compton upscattering).

In this study, a hybrid of genetic algorithm and support vector machines (G-SVM) approach is presented in housing price forecasting. Support vector machine (SVM) has been proven to be a robust and competent algorithm for both classification and regression in many applications. However, how to select the most appropriate the training parameter value is the important problem in the using of SVM. Compared to Grid algorithm, genetic algorithm (GA) method consumes less time and performs well. Thus, GA is applied to optimize the parameters of SVM simultaneously. The cases in China are applied to testify the housing price forecasting ability of G-SVM method. The experimental results indicate that forecasting accuracy of this G-SVM approach is more superior than GM. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

By using the system of generalized equation problems, a new iterative algorithm for solving the system of generalized mixed implicity equilibrium problems is suggested and analyzed. The strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is proved under suitable conditions. These results are new and unify and generalize some recent results in this field.

The intermediates were purified and characterized. Quantitative analysis of the accumulated metabolites from cholesterol side-chain cleavage was conducted during the biotransformation. The results showed that the profile of accumulated intermediates was different from those of other reported microorganisms. Among the five metabolites, androsta-1,4-diene-3,17-dione (ADD) was the main product of the side-chain degradation, with a high conversion rate (87.2%), indicating its potential for industrial production of ADD. At the end of transformation, the substrate cholesterol was completely consumed. The effect of some factors on the bioconversion was also investigated. To our best knowledge, this is the first report regarding cholesterol side-chain cleavage using bacteria belonging to Gordonia.

Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and fluorescence analysis (FA); and the effect of the doping of Dy3+ ions on the microstructures and luminescence properties of the CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphors were also investigated. Our results reveal that the obtained CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphor powders are single-phase scheelite structure with tetragonal symmetry. The doping of Dy3+ ion inhibits the grain growth, decreases the intrinsic emission of MoO42- complex ions. With regard to CaMoO4:Dy-x(3+) phosphors, a bright fluorescent yellow emission at 574 nm (F-4(9/2) -> H-6(13/2)) and blue emission at 487 nm (F-4(9/2) -> F-6(15/2)) have been observed. The decay time of the two emission spectra (487 nm and 574 nm) of Dy3+ ion both decrease with increasing Dy3+ concentration. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The blue-green algae powered MFC produced a maximum power density of 114 mW/m(2) at a current density of 0.55 mA/m(2). Coupled with the bioenergy generation, high removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and nitrogen were also achieved in MFCs. Over 78.9% of total chemical oxygen demand (TCOD), 80.0% of soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD), 91.0% of total nitrogen (total-N) and 96.8% ammonium-nitrogen (NH3-N) were removed under closed circuit conditions in 12 days, which were much more effective than those under open circuit and anaerobic reactor conditions. Most importantly, the MFC showed great ability to remove microcystins released from blue-green algae. Over 90.7% of MC-RR and 91.1% of MC-LR were removed under closed circuit conditions (500 Omega). This study showed that the MFC could provide a potential means for electricity production from blue-green algae coupling algae toxins removal. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Analysis shows that J(1) has significant influence on the magnetic orientation, the pinning field H-p and the coercivity mechanism. When L-8: is small, H-p equals to H-N where the coercivity mechanism transforms from nucleation to pinning as J(1) decreases, whereas for large L-s this trend is reversed. The critical thickness, at which the nucleation field and pinning field detaches, decreases as J(1) decreases. When the reduced exchange coupling is considered, the rigid composite magnet appears only when L-8 is very small. The reduced exchange coupling leads to a sudden change of angle of magnetization at the interface, which results in the change of the behavior of the trilayers from the single-phase one to the two-phase one and in the decrease of H-N whereas H-p increases when L-8 is larger.

Compared with the parent molecule unsubstituted, derivative substituted by CN group results in higher bond dissociation energies, whereas the other lead to lower ones. The studies indicated that the higher heats of formation of compounds of substituent groups possess, the higher ones of derivatives. The normalized heats of formation of these derivatives substituted by N-3, N2H and NHNH2 are 83.1 similar to 95.2 kJ, which is higher than that of triazido-s-triazine (70.2 kJ) reported. For derivatives substituted by N4H, N-3, N4H3, N2H and CN groups, heats of formation calculated lie in the range of 904.9 similar to 1496.6 kJ.mol(-1), but derivatives substituted by N4H and N4H3 show low dissociation energies and relatively low stability.

The geometries of reactants, intermediates, transition states, and products have been optimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d) level. The vibration analysis has been performed to demonstrate the authenticity of transition states. The reaction processes are also confirmed by the changes of charge density at bond-forming critical point which analyzed by the atoms in molecules (AIM) theory. In addition, the nature bond orbital (NBO) analysis is carried out to discuss the bond nature and orbital interactions of the species in the reactions. Compared with that of the reaction without catalyst, the activation energy of that with InCl3 decreases by 339.55 kJ mol(-1). Thus, the present computational results indicate that InCl3 is an effective catalyst. Crown Copyright (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculations of the impurity formation energies and ionization energies for these systems indicate that incorporating the reactive donor F into N doped ZnO systems, not only enhances the N acceptor solubility, but also leads to a shallower N acceptor energy level in the band gap in p-type codoped ZnO. In addition, we analyze the imaginary part of the dielectric functions, and reflectivities for pure and N-F codoped ZnO. Compared with the pure ZnO, the remarkable feature in the dielectric function for N-F codoped ZnO is that there is a sharp peak in the low-energy region.	[Wen, J.; Zuo, C.

Nucleation field, hysteresis loop, coercivity mechanism and critical thickness in composite multilayers with perpendicular anisotropy	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Composite multilayers; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; MEDIA; FILMS	Analytical expression for the nucleation field has been derived for a hard/soft multilayer system with anisotropy perpendicular to the film plane, which depends on the soft thickness L-s, the interface exchange coupling constant J(i) and the intrinsic material parameters. Both nucleation field and coercivity decrease as L-s increases. For very small L-s, the coercivity mechanism is pure nucleation and the hysteresis loops are square. As L-s rises, the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning gradually, where the hysteresis loops have to be calculated numerically. The critical thickness at which the mechanism varies has been discussed in detail on the basis of easy axis orientation and the interface exchange coupling constant. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Reduced exchange coupling and hysteresis loops in two-phased magnetic nanosystem	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Composite Magnet; Multilayer; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	NANOLAYERS	The reduced exchange coupling has been incorporated in our micromagnetic calculations for the hysteresis loops of Nd(2)Fe(14)B/alpha-Fe and Sm(40)Fe(60)/Ni(80)Fe(20) multilayers. Analysis shows that nucleation and pinning fields are sensitive to the value of the interface coupling constant J(i) when the soft layer thickness L(s) is small. Hysteresis loops have been obtained for a trilayer system with a soft alpha-Fe sandwiched between two Nd(2)Fe(14)B layers for different values of L(s) and J(i). As J(i) decreases, nucleation field decreases while the pinning field increases. In the meantime, the squareness of the loops is deteriorated, which results in smaller energy product. For thick soft layer the coercivity mechanism transforms from pinning to nucleation as the interface coupling decreases, and vice versa. The above calculations have been extended to a Sm(40)Fe(60)/Ni(80)Fe(20) bilayer and compared with available experimental data. The theoretical loop is consistent with the experimental one when the value of J(i) is taken as 10% of the bulk one, demonstrating that the interface coupling in the experiment is far away from perfect coupling.

The structure of the LiFePO4/C composites was investigated by X-ray diffraction (XRD). The micromorphology of the precursor and LiFePO4/C powders was observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the in situ coating of carbon on the particles was observed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Furthermore, the electrochemical properties were evaluated by cyclic voltammograms (CVs), electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and constant current charge/discharge cycling tests. The results showed that the sample synthesized at 700 degrees C had the best electrochemical performance, exhibiting initial discharge capacities of 157, 139 and 109 mAh g(-1) at rates of 0.1, 1 and 5 C, respectively. Moreover, the sample presented excellent capacity retention as there was no significant capacity fade after 50 cycles. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The Hamiltonian of our system is solved by means of the slave-boson mean-field approximation, and the variation of the density of states, the transmission probability, the occupation number, and the Rondo temperature with the interdot Coulomb repulsion are discussed in the Rondo regime. The density of states is calculated for various interdot Coulomb repulsions with both parallel and antiparallel lead-polarization alignments. Our results reveal that the interdot Coulomb repulsion greatly influences the physical property of this system, and relevant underlying physics of this system is discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Firstly, the existence of the ground state for the system derives the best constant of a Gagliardo-Nirenberg type inequality and the variational character of the ground state. Secondly, the blow-up threshold of the Davey-Stewartson system is developed in R-3. Thirdly, the mass concentration is established for all the blow-up solutions of the system in R-2. Finally, the existence of the minimal blow-up solutions in R-2 is constructed by using the pseudo-conformal invariance. The profile of the minimal blow-up solutions as t -> T (blow-up time) is in detail investigated in terms of the ground state. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

Fabrication of uniform Ge-nanocrystals embedded in amorphous SiO2 films using Ge-ion implantation and neutron irradiation methods	APPLIED PHYSICS LETTERS			English	Article							TRANSMUTATION-DOPED GAAS; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; MISFIT DISLOCATIONS; LASERS GO; SILICON; FILMS	Uniform Ge-nanocrystals (Ge-ncs) embedded in amorphous SiO2 film were formed by using Ge-74(+) ion implantation and neutron transmutation doping (NTD) method. Both experimental and theoretical results indicate that the existence of As dopants transmuted from Ge-74 by NTD tunes the already stabilized (crystallized) system back to a metastable state and then activates the mass transfer processes during the transition form this metastable state back to the stable (crystallized) state, and hence the nanocrystal size uniformity and higher volume density of Ge-ncs. This method has the potential to open a route in the three-dimensional nanofabrication. (C) 2011 American Institute of Physics.

A system of auxiliary generalized mixed equilibrium problems (SAGMEPs) for solving the SGMEPs is first introduced. Existence and uniqueness of the solutions to the SAGMEPs is proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions in reflexive Banach spaces. Using the auxiliary principle technique, a new iterative algorithm for solving the SGMEPs is proposed and analyzed. Strong convergence of the iterative sequences generated by the algorithm is also proved under quite mild assumptions without any coercive conditions. These results improve, unify, and generalize some recent results in this field.

The characterization of the localization of a (t, v)-Dedekind domain further leads us to study the quotient ring R[X]N-v, over a (t, v)-Dedekind domain R.

For most people, diet is the main route of exposure to potentially harmful elements, so determination of the concentrations of these elements in foodstuffs and assessment of their possible risk for humans via dietary intake is very important. This study was designed to investigate the concentrations of different elements, including Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se in foodstuffs and to estimate the potential health risk of these elements via consumption of polluted foodstuffs in the Wanshan Hg mine area. Guizhou province, SW China. The multielemental concentrations were determined by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). The target hazard quotient (THQ) and hazard index (HI) were calculated to evaluate the potential health risk from individual and combined potentially harmful elements due to dietary intake. The average contents of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se in the most frequently consumed foodstuffs were: 31, 248, 121, 1035 and 32 mu g/kg respectively. Among them, Cd and Hg were the most important contributors to potentially harmful elements contamination in Wanshan. Eight of 10 kinds of vegetables were contaminated to various levels by different elements but the samples of rice, pork, radish and potato were below the stipulated limits for toxic elements. In this study, the average dietary intakes of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn, Se by an adult man of 60 kg living in Wanshan were: 27, 167, 86, 1061, 42 mu g/day. respectively. The HIs for multielement dietary intake was 3.11, with the relative contributions of Hg, Pb, Cd, Mn and Se being 22.3%, 24.3%, 45.0%, 3.9% and 4.4%, respectively, which indicated that consumption of food poses a potential health risk. Vegetables were found to be the main source of potentially harmful element dietary intake. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The introduction of substituents resulted in considerable red shifts for the highest absorption wavelength of the Pt complexes. The lowest energy excitation absorption mainly consisted of d ->pi(star) and pi ->pi(star) excitations from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO). Metal to ligand charge-transfer (MLCT) and ligand to ligand charge-transfer (LLCT) were mainly involved. Adulteration with the transition metals Pt and Ag resulted in a significant increase in the third-order nonlinear optical coefficient gamma of 8-hydroxyquinolinolate. The introduction of -Ph, -PhOCH3, -PhF2, and -PhF5 further improved the gamma value of the 8-hydroxyquinolinolate metal complexes. The gradient of the gamma value increased with an increase in the electron-donating ability of the introduced substituent. This gradient was lower for substituent with a higher electron-accepting ability.

The adsorption property of this new adsorbent to ions of light rare earth such as La3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ (RE3+) in aqueous solution was investigated. Results show that the optimum pH value of this adsorbent to La3+ is about 5.0, while the optimum value of Pr3+ and Nd3+ is about 5.5. The equilibrium adsorption capacity will decline significantly when the pH value of reaction system is changed from the optimum pH value. Compared with the effect of pH value, the influence of the temperature on the equilibrium adsorption capacity is weaker, and at 303 K the equilibrium adsorption capacity of this adsorbent to RE3+ is optimal. At 303 K and the optimum pH value, when the initial concentration of RE3+ solution is 5.0 mmol.L-1 and the dosage of adsorbent is 0.10 g, the equilibrium adsorption capacity of this adsorbent to La3+, Pr3+ and Nd3+ are 217.26, 228.56 and 329.76 mg.g(-1), respectively. The adsorption isotherm can be described by the Freundlich equation. This adsorption kinetics data of this adsorbent to RE3+ is fitted with the pseudo-second-order rate model well and the equilibrium adsorption capacities calculated by the model are consistent with the experimental data with the warps in 7 %.

The obtained LiCoO2 thin films were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The influence of electrochemical reaction time, current density and concentration of LiOH solution on the crystal structure and morphology of the obtained LiCoO2 thin films was discussed emphatically. Our results show that the as-synthesized LiCoO2 films all are pure hexagonal structure. The crystallinity, densification and uniformity of the films increase with increasing electrochemical reaction time, current density as well as concentration of LiOH solution and then decrease. The preferable electrochemical reaction conditions were optimized as: electrochemical reaction time is 50 h, current density is 1 mA cm(-2) and concentration of LiOH solution is 3 mol dm(-3).

The present study was designed to investigate the effects of crocin, a potential chemopreventive agent, on growth and DNA and RNA content in a human tongue squamous cell carcinoma cell line, Tca8113. Methods: Tca8113 cells were treated with crocin for 24, 48, 72, and 96 h at concentrations of 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mM. Tumor cell viability was investigated using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. In addition, Tca8113 cells were treated with 0.4 mM crocin and cytotoxic effects as an inducer of apoptosis were analyzed using flow cytometry. Furthermore, acridine orange (AO) staining and observation using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSCM) were used to determine the effects of the drug on nucleic acid synthesis. Results: Crocin decreased Tca8113 cell viability and growth remarkably at 24, 48, 72, and 96 h, in a concentration-dependent manner (P<0.05). In addition, 0.4 mM crocin significantly induced both early and late apoptosis of Tca8113 cells. Moreover, the cellular DNA and RNA content was significantly downregulated by 0.4 mM crocin compared with the negative control (P<0.01). Conclusions: Our observations support the feasibility of applying crocin as a chemoprophylactic agent and treatment for OSCCs.

The bonding processing of TiO(2)molecule on the surface of GaN( 0001 ), the adsorption energy, and the adsorption orientation are investigated. The results indicate that Ti atom is adsorbed on fcc site or on hcp site, and two O atoms are combined with two Ga atoms on the GaN surface after adsorption. The chemical bonding of Ga-O shows a covalent feature, and the chemical bonding energy is achieved to be 7. 932 7. 943 eV. The O-O line directions lie along the GaN [ 11 (2) over bar0 ] directions, in accordance with experimental reports of ( 100 ) [ 001 ] TiO2// ( 0001 ) [ 11 (2) over bar0 ] GaN. From ab initio dynamics calculation, the adsorption process can be divided into physical adsorption, chemical adsorption and superficial stable state, and the stable adsorption site is in accordance with the optimized results.

It is shown that CO molecules can be absorbed to Au atoms on the wall of Au-doped SWCNT with a bingding energy as high as 2. 1 eV, and can attract lager charge transfer 0. 23. Compared with the intrinsic SWCNT, the Au-doped SWCNT presents a high sensitivity to CO in terms of the calculated geometrical structures and electronic properties, Furthermore, the calculated electron densities of two representative adsorption positions show that Au-doped SWCNT electron clouds overlap more on the top of carbon adsorbed CO. By comparison with the oxygen absorption on SWCNT, we infer that the molecular CO absorbed on Au-doped SWCNT can induce significant change in the conductivity of SWCNT. So Au-doped SWCNT is expected to be a potential candidate for detecting the presence of CO.

Significant effect of oxygen atmosphere on the structure, optical and electrical properties of Ti-doped In2O3 transparent conductive thin films	OPTICA APPLICATA			English	Article						transparent oxide; indium oxide; thin films; electrical properties; optical properties	INDIUM OXIDE; HIGH-MOBILITY	Titanium-doped indium oxide (In2O3) transparent conductive thin films were deposited on glass and sapphire (0001) substrates with/without oxygen atmosphere by DC magnetron sputtering at 300 degrees C. The content of titanium is estimated to be about 1.8 at.% using energy dispersive spectroscopy. The smooth surfaces were covered with more uniform octahedral grains. X-ray diffraction measurements indicated that the preferential growth orientation along the (400) plane for the sample grown without oxygen atmosphere shifts to (222) for the sample grown in the oxygen atmosphere. The average optical transmittance of the sample grown with the introduction of oxygen varies from 70% to 90% in the visible region, which corresponds well to the variation of carrier and mobility. Hence, both intermediate dopant and oxygen atmosphere will provide the optimum balance between carrier concentration and mobility leading to the best transport properties of Ti-doped In2O3 films.

We investigate a general iterative algorithm, which consists of a splitting proximal point step followed by a suitable orthogonal projection onto a hyperplane. Moreover, in our splitting algorithm, we only use the individual resolvent mapping (I + mu(k)partial derivative f)(-1) and never work directly with the operator T + partial derivative f, where mu(k) is a positive real number, T is a set-valued mapping and partial derivative f is the sub-differential of function f. We also prove the convergence of the algorithm for the case that T is a pseudomonotone set-valued mapping and f is a non-smooth convex function.

The reasonability of the approximation of complex Gaussian functions expansion method is studied, and a comparison of this method with the generalised truncated second-order moments method and the asymptotic analysis method is also made. In general, an easy analytical expression for the M-2 factor of truncated laser beams can be derived by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method. The M-2 factor obtained by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method is more consistent with that in practice than that obtained by using two other methods. The analytical results obtained by using the complex Gaussian functions expansion method can be reduced to that for the non-truncated case when the truncation parameter is sufficiently large. Therefore, the complex Gaussian functions expansion method is a suitable approximation method for studying the M-2 factor of truncated laser beams.

We find that the oscillatory amplitude of the optical spectra, the transient absorption (gain), and the response time from the transient to the steady situation are remarkably dependent on the SV. When including the VIC, the transient and steady optical properties display a reverse variation with the SV. Additionally, it is interesting to find that the steady population distribution is kept at the same value for different initial conditions in the presence of SV. (C) 2010 Elsevier GmbH.

J	Hu, SX; Liao, ZW; Sun, D; Chen, WF				Hu, Shaoxiang; Liao, Zhiwu; Sun, Dan; Chen, Wufan			A Numerical Method for Preserving Curve Edges in Nonlinear Anisotropic Smoothing	MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING			English	Article							IMAGE; DIFFUSION; SPACE	We focus on nonlinearity for images and propose a new method which can preserve curve edges in image smoothing using nonlinear anisotropic diffusion (NAD). Unlike existing methods which diffuse only among the spatial variants, the new method suggests that the diffusion should be performed both among the time variants and spatial variants, named time and space nonlinear anisotropic diffusion (TSNAD). That is, not only the differences of the spatial variants should be estimated by the nearby spatial points but also the differences of the time variants should be approximated by the weighted time differences of nearby points, according to the differences of gray levels between them and the consideration point. Since the time differences of nearby points using NAD can find more points with similar gray levels which form a curve belt for the center pixel on a curve edge, TSNAD can provide satisfied smoothing results while preserving curve edges. The experiments for digital images also show us the ability of TSNAD to preserve curve edges.

The liquid crystal properties were studied with differential scanning calorimetry and polarizing optical microscopy. The influences of amide alkyl chain lengths on the mesomorphism were discussed. Based on the results, we concluded that the triphenylene discogens with an amido-based alkyl chain could form intermolecular hydrogen bonds inside their columnar stacks, and hence, exhibit higher melting and clearing points, and wider mesophase ranges.

Chemical structures were confirmed by 1H NMR; and mesomorphism was studied by polarized optical microscopy as well as by differential scanning calorimetry. The mesomorphic studies have shown that 1) the chiral discogens have either hexagonal columnar or plastic columnar mesophases; and 2) the introduction of chirality to triphenylene-based discotic liquid crystals could widen mesophase range by lowering melting points. In addition, an unexpected odd-even effect of mesomorphism was observed.

J	Feng, L				Feng, Lin			An intrusion detection approach based on multiple rough classifiers integration	JOURNAL OF EXPERIMENTAL & THEORETICAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE			English	Article						multiple rough classifiers; quantum genetic algorithm; the absolute majority voting strategy; rough set; intrusion detection techniques		The study of intrusion detection techniques has been one of the hot spot topics in the field of network security in recent years. For high-dimensional intrusion detection data sets and a single classifier's weak classification ability for data sets with many classes, a novel intrusion detection approach, termed intrusion detection based on multiple rough classifiers integration, is proposed. First, some training data sets are generated from intrusion detection data by random sampling. By combing rough sets and quantum genetic algorithm, a subset of attributes is selected. Then, each simplified data set is trained, which establishes a group of rough classifiers. Finally, the intrusion data classification result is obtained according to the absolute majority voting strategy. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our methods.

The new qualification condition is weaker than the popular constraint qualification of Robinson. An example is presented to show the usefulness of the result.

The main problem is to compute the error distance of a received word. Using the Weil bound for character sum estimate, Li and Wan showed that the error distance can be determined when the degree of the received word as a polynomial is small. In the first part, the result of Li and Wan is improved. On the other hand, one of the important parameters of an error-correcting code is the dimension. In most cases, one can only get bounds for the dimension. In the second part, a formula for the dimension of the generalized trace Reed-Solomon codes in some cases is obtained.

In addition, there exists competition between the nonlinearities induced by the interatomic interaction and by the driven cavity for the emergences of self-trapping. Our results show that the driven cavity can be utilized as a possible tool to produce the self-trapping for the condensates with weak interatomic interaction.

It is shown that the M-2-factor is not a propagation invariant in turbulence, and the turbulence results in an increase of the M-2-factor. For the incoherent combination, the M-2-factor of ChG array beams increases with increasing propagation distance, beam parameter, relative beam separation distance and beam number. For the coherent combination, the M-2-factor of ChG array beams increases with oscillatory behavior as the beam parameter or the relative beam separation distance increases. For the coherent combination the M-2-factor is always smaller than that for the incoherent combination. However, for the incoherent combination the M-2-factor is always less sensitive to turbulence than that for the coherent combination. In particular, the influence of turbulence on the M-2-factor can be reduced by a suitable choice of the relative beam separation distance. With increasing beam number, the M-2-factor becomes more sensitive to turbulence for the coherent combination, while for the incoherent combination the M-2-factor becomes less sensitive to turbulence.

It includes 17,660 base pairs, containing 13 protein-coding genes, two rRNAs and 23 tRNAs. A tandem duplication of tRNA(Met) gene was found in this mitochondrial genome, and the similarity between the two tRNA(Met) genes is 85.8%, being the highest in amphibian mitochondrial genomes sequenced thus far. Based on gene organization, 24 types were found from 145 amphibian mitochondrial genomes. Type 1 was present in 108 species, type 11 in 11 species, types 5, 16, 17, and 20 each in two species, and the others each present in one species. Fifteen types were found in Anura, being the most diversity in three orders of the Lissamphibia. Our phylogenetic results using 11 protein-coding gene sequences of 145 amphibian mitochondrial genomes strongly support the monophyly of the Lissamphibia, as well as its three orders, the Gymnophiona, Caudata, and Anura, among which the relationships were ((Gymnophiona (Caudata, Anura)). Based on the phylogenetic trees, type 1 was recognized as the ancestral type for amphibians, and type 11 was the synapomorphic type for the Neobatrachia. Gene rearrangements among lineages provide meaningful phylogenetic information. The rearrangement of the LTPF tRNA gene cluster and the translocation of the ND5 gene only found in the Neobatrachia support the monophyly of this group; similarly, the tandem duplication of the tRNA(Met) genes only found in the Dicroglossidae support the monophyly of this family [Current Zoology 57 (6): 785-805, 2011].

In particular, optimal normal bases are desirable. When no optimal normal basis exists, it is useful to have normal bases with low complexity. In this paper, we improve the upper bounds for the complexity of the trace normal bases over finite fields and prove that these upper bounds can be reached for some extension with small degree. In addition, we construct a class of normal bases with low complexity by this way. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

J	Yang, CL; Tian, SL; Long, B; Chen, F				Yang, Chenglin; Tian, Shulin; Long, Bing; Chen, Fang			Methods of Handling the Tolerance and Test-Point Selection Problem for Analog-Circuit Fault Diagnosis	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INSTRUMENTATION AND MEASUREMENT			English	Article						Analog fault diagnosis; fault dictionary; fault model; test-point selection; tolerance	DICTIONARY	Soft-fault diagnosis and tolerance are two challenging problems in analog-circuit fault diagnosis. Although many analog faults can be diagnosed theoretically, they cannot be accurately diagnosed due to the influence of component tolerance. This paper proposes approaches to the tolerance-handling method in soft-fault diagnosis. First, the slope fault model and its theoretical proof are presented. In linear analog circuits, the voltage equation between two nodes is linear and can be expressed by a point-slope-form equation in which the point is determined by the nominal voltage values on the two selected nodes, and the slope, which is invariant, can be used as the fault model, which is applicable to both hard (open or short) and soft (parametric) faults. Then, the parameter tolerance is taken into consideration. The point-slope-form equation is governed by a point and a slope value. The tolerance influences the fault diagnosis by shifting both the point and the nominal slope value. These influences can be mitigated in two ways: 1) The point is measured when an actual circuit is under steady state and free of fault, and 2) the maximum slope deviation is readily obtained by using optimization theory if the equation governing the voltage between two nodes is available; otherwise, a threshold proportion coefficient is used to calculate the maximum deviation. Based on these methods, a novel test-point selection approach for the fault dictionary technique is proposed. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is verified by both simulated and experimental results.

This article describes the estimation of tropical forest biomass by using Landsat TM and forest plot data in Xishuangbanna, PR China. The method includes several steps. First, the biomass for each forest permanent plot is calculated by using field inventory data. Second, Landsat TM images are geometrically corrected by using topographic maps. Third, a map of the tropical forest is obtained by using data from a variety of sources such as Landsat TM, digital elevation model (DEM), temperature and precipitation layers and expert knowledge. Finally, the biomass and carbon storage of each forest vegetation type in the forest map is calculated by using the tropical forest map and the forest plot biomass GIS database. In the study area, forest area accounts for 57% of the total 1.7 x 10(6) hectares. The total forest biomass is 2.0 x 10(8) tonne. It is shown that the forest vegetation map, the forest biomass and the forest carbon storage can be obtained by effectively integrating Landsat TM, ancillary data including DEM, temperature and precipitation, forest permanent plots and knowledge using the method proposed here.

The gyrB gene sequence of strain AD-6(T) exhibited similarities of 77-91% with those of the type strains of recognized species of the genus Gordonia, being most similar to the type strains of G. sihwensis, G. hydrophobica and Gordonia hirsuta (91, 87 and 84% similarity, respectively). The results of whole-cell fatty acid analyses and DNA DNA relatedness data readily distinguished the new isolate from its nearest neighbours. Strain AD-6(T) is therefore considered to represent a novel species of the genus Gordonia, for which the name Gordonia neofelifaecis sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is AD-6(T) (=NRRL B-59395(T) =CCTCC AB-209144(T)).

It is also the first study conducted in China on agreement between parents reporting on their child. Both parents of 380 girls and 320 boys completed the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (Chinese version). Because reliabilities were poor, the Conduct Problems and Hyperactivity/Inattention subscales were merged to form an Externalizing Problems subscale, and the Peer Problems subscale as an independent variable was omitted from analyses. Consistent with past research, moderate to strong correlations were found between mother and father reports for emotional and behavioral problems, although interparent agreement was better for externalizing problems than internalizing problems for both girls and boys. Mothers reported significantly higher scores than fathers for prosocial behaviors for their sons. Findings suggest that, in general, one parent's report will be similar to the other's when the SDQ is used in the form adapted for this study. More work on the psychometric properties of the SDQ is needed in China.

In this paper, we propose a new scheme, named Enclosed Laplacian Operator of Nonlinear Anisotropic Diffusion (ELONAD), which allows us to provide a unified framework for points in flat regions, edge points and corners, even can delete isolated points and spurs. ELONAD extends two diffusion directions of classical NAD to eight or more enclosed directions. Thus it not only performs NAD according to modules of enclosed directions which can reduce the influence of traction errors greatly, but also distinguishes isolated points and small spurs from corners which must be preserved. Smoothing results for test patterns and real images using different discretization schemes are also given to test and verify our discussions.

The compounds were characterized by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), elemental analysis, and mass. Thermal gravimetry analysis (TGA) showed that the FTPDLCs were thermally stable until 300 degrees C. Differential scanning calorimerty (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy (POM) investigations of the mesomorphism found that the FTPDLCs exhibited enantiotropic hexagonal columnar mesophase (Colh) and had much higher clear points than the corresponding hexaalkoxytriphenylenes, C18H6(OR)6. Noticeably, semi-quantitative studies showed that the number of fluorinated ester chains on the triphenylene core was directly proportional to FTPDLCs' clearing points and the order of hexagonal columnar mesophases. In addition, FTPDLCs' mesomorphism was found to be affected by molecular symmetry and by the relative length between the semi-fluorinated chains and the alkoxy chains. Most importantly, we further proved that the mesomorphism of TPDLCs could be better improved through introducing fluorinated ester chains than the ether chains as reported previously.

On conductivity type conversion of p-type silicon exposed to a low-frequency inductively coupled plasma of Ar + H-2	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS D-APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							CZOCHRALSKI-GROWN SILICON; THERMAL DONORS; HYDROGEN DIFFUSION; OXYGEN DIFFUSION; SPECTROSCOPY; TEMPERATURES; CDXHG1-XTE; MICROSCOPY; HGCDTE; SI	The treatment of an Ar + H-2 plasma generated by a low-frequency inductively coupled plasma system at 500 degrees C introduces an n-type region (of average electron concentration similar to 10(15) cm(-3)) on a Czochralski p-type substrate, forming a deep p-n junction. Examination by an electron microscope shows that the plasma treatment produces uniform nanocones on the surface and some defects, such as dislocations and platelets, in the subsurface. All these observed results are hydrogen-related. The conductivity type conversion is due to the formation of hydrogen-enhanced oxygen-related thermal donors (OTDs) as well as hydrogen-incorporated shallow thermal donors. The OTD-related signals are directly observed in the infrared absorption spectra. Both donors are annihilated after annealing at 550 degrees C for 10 min, resulting in conductivity recovery from n-type to original p-type. The electrical properties of the as-formed junction are investigated using current versus voltage (I-V), capacitance versus voltage (C-V) and Hall effect measurements. On this basis, the junction depth, carrier profile and hydrogen diffusion behaviour are studied. Moreover, a clear photovoltaic effect of the junction has been observed through the Suns-Voc and illuminated I-V tests.	[Zhou, H. P.; Xu, L. X.; Xu, S.; Huang, S. Y.; Wei, D. Y.; Xiao, S. Q.; Yan, W.

It is found that the optical properties of Zn1-xMgxO are caused by the codoped Al and N to vary mainly in a low energy region, whereas they remain almost unchanged in a high energy region. The detailed calculations, including the imaginary part of the dielectric constant, absorption spectrum and extinction coefficient, indicate that due to the codoped Al and N, the optical absorption of Zn1-xMgxO shifts toward lower energy and the absorption of the ultraviolet and the visible absorption increase. Study on the real part of the dielectric constant and reflection spectrum of Zn1-xMgxO shows that the codoped Al and N are responsible for the increased reflection peak intensity, and also for the static dielectric constant increasing from 2. 64 to 3. 23. In addition, the calculations from the current electron energy loss function indicate that the codoped Al and N lead to the enhanced amplitude and the blue shift of the plasma resonant frequency of Zn1-xMgxO.

Three candidate structures are chosen to investigate NbN, namely, rocksalt (NaCl), NiAs and WC types. On the basis of the third- order Birch- Murnaghan equation of states, the transition pressure Pt (Pt = 200.64GPa) between the WC phase and the NaCl phase of NbN is predicted for the first time. Elastic constants, formation enthalpies, shear modulus, Young's modulus, and Poisson's ratio of NbN are derived. The calculated results are found to be in good agreement with the available experimental data and theoretical values. According to the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the Debye temperature under high pressure is derived from the average sound velocity. Moreover, the effect of metallic bonding on the hardness of NbN is investigated and the hardness shows a gradual decrease rather than increase under compression. This is a quantitative investigation on the structural and thermodynamic properties of NbN, and it still awaits experimental confirmation.

Shock-induced cation disorder in magnesium aluminate spinel	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article							SITU NEUTRON-DIFFRACTION; MGAL2O4 SPINEL; ORDER-DISORDER; CERAMICS; POWDER	An increase in lattice constants and an order-disorder phase transition were observed in the magnesium aluminate spinel (MgAl(2)O(4)) powders after shock compression. Theoretical calculations on the basis of density functional theory confirm that the remarkable volume expansion in shocked MgAl(2)O(4) powders is closely related to the substantial site disorder in the MgAl(2)O(4) lattice. The calculations also show that the partially inverse MgAl(2)O(4) spinel with an inversion index of 0.7 represents the greatest disordered metastable phase and the most unstable structure.

The cholesterol esterase of the strain CHE4-1 was purified by ultrafiltration followed with DEAE-Sepharose FF chromatography and Phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B chromatography, and then by Sephadex G-50 gel filtration. Different from other known microbial cholesterol esterase, the purified CHE from CHE4-1 strain is a monomer with molecular weight of 6.5 kD and has high activity to both long-chain and short-chain cholesterol ester. Enzymatic activity was enhanced in the presence of metal ion Ca2+, Zn2+ and boracic acid, and was not significantly affected by several detergents including sodium cholate, Triton X100 and Tween-80. The enzyme was found to be stable during long-term aqueous storage at 4 degrees C, indicating its potential as a clinical diagnostic reagent. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report regarding purification and characterization of CHE from Acinetobacter sp. The results demonstrated that this particular CHE is a novel cholesterol esterase.

C-H activation has mainly been achieved through four metal-mediated pathways: oxidative addition, electrophilic substitution, sigma-bond metathesis and metal-associated carbene/nitrene/oxo insertion. However, the identification of methods that do not require transition-metal catalysts is important because methods involving such catalysts are often expensive. Another advantage would be that the requirement to remove metallic impurities from products could be avoided, an important issue in the synthesis of pharmaceutical compounds. Here, we describe the identification of a cross-coupling between aryl iodides/bromides and the C-H bonds of arenes that is mediated solely by the presence of 1,10-phenanthroline as catalyst in the presence of KOt-Bu as a base. This apparently transition-metal-free process provides a new strategy with which to achieve direct C-H functionalization.

Squeezing survival and transfer in single and double electromagnetically induced transparency	JOURNAL OF PHYSICS B-ATOMIC MOLECULAR AND OPTICAL PHYSICS			English	Article							LIGHT; STATES; STORAGE; SYSTEM	We investigate the propagation and storage of a squeezed vacuum as the probe light in a collection of N four-level tripod configuration atoms under the condition of single or double electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT). The squeezing of the probe light is well preserved in both the single transparency channel and the double transparency one. On the other hand, the effects of the ground state dephasing rates on the propagation and storage of the squeezed vacuum are investigated. It is found that the maximum squeezing at the transparency points is suppressed by the dephasing rates in single or double EIT. Meanwhile, the mapping of the squeezing of the probe light onto the atomic ground coherences or onto the two atomic dark-state polaritons is also studied. In the absence of the Langevin atomic noise, the quasi-ideal squeezing transfer between the squeezed vacuum and the atomic ground coherences or the dark-state polaritons can be realized in such a system. When considering the Langevin atomic noise, the quantum characteristics of the atomic coherences at resonance are submerged by the Langevin noise, while in the scenario of the dark-state polariton, it is found that squeezing transfer onto one polariton is damaged, but the squeezing transfer onto the other polariton survives even in the presence of the Langevin noise.

The agreement between the experimental data and simulation result reveals that due to the predominant interchain interaction, each three backbones stack together to form a distinct lamellar cluster with side chains packed inside dispersedly. The thickness of the lamellar cluster is about 16.0A degrees, corresponding to a strong peak at 5.5 degrees in SAXS pattern. As the backbone is not perfectly parallel to each other in each lamellar cluster, the distance between each backbone ranges from 5.8 to 8.8 A degrees possibly relating to the weak peak at 9.8 degrees in WAXS pattern. Meanwhile, no birefringence or apparent phase texture has been observed by PLM indicating an amorphous nature in this film. (C) 2010 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The optimized structure parameters are in good agreement with the experimental data. The mechanical stability of AgGaS2 is confirmed by calculations of the elastic constants. The band structure and density of states were calculated and it is shown that the crystal is a semiconductor with a direct energy band gap of about 1.005 eV for AgGaS2. Calculations of the optical properties, namely the dielectric function, refractive index, extinction coefficient, absorption coefficient, optical reflectivity and electron energy loss spectrum, were performed for the energy range 0-25 eV. The results indicate that AgGaS2 is a promising mid-IR crystal material.

Fourteen stable structures for the catechin-guanine complexes have been found which form two hydrogen bonds at least. The results indicate that the complexes are mainly stabilized by the hydrogen bonding interactions. At the same time, the number and strength of hydrogen bond play a co-determinant parts in the stability of the complexes which can form two or more hydrogen bonds. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been adopted to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all systems. The interaction energies of all complexes have been corrected for basis set superposition error (BSSE), ranging from -38.86 to -14.56 kJ/mol. The results showed that the hydrogen bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The corresponding bonds stretching motions in all complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer, which is in agreement with experimental results.

Thickness dependent magnetic reversal process and hysteresis loops in exchange-coupled hard-soft trilayers	JOURNAL OF APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article								The demagnetization process of a hard/soft/hard sandwich has been investigated systematically within a self-contained micromagnetic model, with particular attention on the cases with small hard layer thickness. The microscopic and macroscopic hysteresis loops, as well as the angular distributions of the magnetization between nucleation and pinning have been obtained numerically, with the formula for the nucleation field derived. It is found that both nucleation and pinning fields, as well as the gap in between decrease as the hard layer thickness reduces. The hard layer thickness has great effect on the hysteresis loops only when the thickness is very small, where the hysteresis loop is nearly square and the dominant coercivity mechanism is the nucleation. The thickness regions at which the theoretical and practical giant energy products can be achieved have been discussed. In most cases, the hard layer can be taken as sufficiently thick so that the magnetization at its surface obeys a simple coherent rotation model. In these cases, the calculation can be simplified significantly, with only the influence of the soft layer thickness accounted. (C) 2010 American Institute of Physics.

Based on the topological degree theory of set-valued mappings, an alternative theorem is obtained which says that the generalized variational inequality has either a solution or an exceptional family of elements. As an application, we present a sufficient condition to ensure the existence of a solution to the variational inequality. The set-valued mapping is assumed to be upper semicontinuous with nonempty compact convex values.

Structure and piezoelectric properties of new (Bi0.5Na0.5)(1-x-y)Ba-x(Yb0.5Na0.5)(y)TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							DEPOLARIZATION TEMPERATURE; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; TRANSITION	New lead-free ceramics (Bi0.5Na0.5)(1-x-y)Ba-x(Yb0.5Na0.5)(y)TiO3 (x = 0.02-0.10 and y = 0-0.04) have been prepared by an ordinary sintering technique and their structure and piezoelectric properties have been studied. X-ray diffraction shows that Ba2+ and Yb3+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a solid solution with a pure perovskite structure and a morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) between rhombohedral and tetragonal phases is formed at 0.04 < x < 0.10. The partial substitutions of Ba2+ and Yb3+ for A-site ions of Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 decrease effectively the coercive field E (c) and improve significantly the remanent polarization P (r). The ceramics with x = 0.06 and y = 0-0.02 situate within the MPB and possess the lower E (c) and larger P (r), and thus exhibit optimum piezoelectric properties: d (33) = 155-171 pC/N and k (p) = 29.2-36.7%. The temperature dependences of the dielectric and ferroelectric properties suggest that the ceramics may contain both the polar and non-polar regions at temperatures near/above T (d).

It is shown that z(R) of Gaussian array beams propagating through atmospheric turbulence depends on the strength of turbulence, the array beam parameters and the type of beam combination. For the coherent combination z(R) decreases due to turbulence. However, for the incoherent combination there exists a maximum of z(R) as the strength of turbulence varies. The z(R) of coherently combined Gaussian array beams is larger than that of incoherently combined Gaussian array beams, but for the coherent combination case z(R) is more sensitive to turbulence than that for the incoherent combination case. The larger the beam number is, the longer z(R) is, and the more z(R) is affected by turbulence. For the coherent combination z(R) is not monotonic versus the relative beam separation distance, and the effect of turbulence on z(R) is appreciable within a certain range of the relative beam separation distance.

An analysis on radius of curvature aspects of hyperbolic and sinusoidal Gaussian beams	APPLIED PHYSICS B-LASERS AND OPTICS			English	Article							ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION	The effective radius of curvature of hyperbolic and sinusoidal Gaussian beams in free space and turbulent atmosphere is studied analytically and numerically. It is shown that the radius of curvature rises with growing source size, and changes slowly with wavelength. In general, given the same source and propagation settings, the beams can be listed in descending order of radius of curvature magnitudes as sinh Gaussian, cosh Gaussian, sine Gaussian, pure Gaussian and cos Gaussian beams. However, the radius of curvature and the difference of the radius of curvature between the different beams reduce with growing strength of turbulence because the beam's spatial phase distribution is destroyed by turbulence.

The results showed that the most stable dimer D1 had two same linear N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bonds, and the interaction energy between them was 51.038 kJ.mol(-1) which was corrected by the basis set superposition error and zero-point. The stretching vibration frequency of N-H bond had a red shift because of the hydrogen bonds. The natural bond orbital analysis showed that each N-H center dot center dot center dot O hydrogen bond in D1 had the biggest interaction stabilization energy of 69.078 kJ.mol(-1).

To this end, we use a generalized gradient approximation within density functional theory (DFT) at the PW91/DNP level to investigate the reaction processes of Sr, Ti, and O, the formation of SrO and TiO(2), and the microscopic reaction mechanism underlying the formation of STO. We calculate the reaction intermediates, transition states (TSs), and activation energy and explore the STO formation mechanisms using highest-occupied and lowest-unoccupied molecular orbital theory. In addition, several possible conformations of STO molecules are comparatively investigated. We find that in steady-state conformations of STO, the geometry eigenvalue is similar to the STO unit cell, which indicates that SrO, TiO(2), and STO are the primary particle states during the early growth of STO thin films. Because it acts as a combining center, TiO(2) is preferentially formed and, subsequently. SrO combines with these centers to form STO, which is stable and somewhat similar to the STO crystal cell. These mechanisms lead to the formation of perovskite-structured STO thin films. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier B.V.

Hence, the accuracy of these algorithms is closely related to the accuracy of the ICT technique. Unfortunately, this technique is not accurate, especially when the size of fault dictionary is large. This paper proposes an accurate fault-pair Boolean table technique for the test point selection problem. First, the approach to transform the fault dictionary into a fault-pair Boolean table is introduced. Then, a test point selection algorithm based on the fault-pair Boolean table is proposed. Thirdly, several example circuits are used to illustrate the proposed algorithm. Simulated results indicate that the proposed method is more accurate than the other methods. Therefore, it is a good solution for minimizing the size of the test point set.

Ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties of new NaNbO3-Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 lead-free ceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; PHASE-TRANSITION; SYSTEM	New lead-free ceramics (1-x)NaNbO3-xBi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3) have been fabricated by the conventional ceramic sintering technique, and their ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties have been studied. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 diffuses into the NaNbO3 lattices to form a new perovskite-type solid solution with orthorhombic symmetry. The addition of a small amount of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 (x a parts per thousand yen 0.025) transforms the ceramics from antiferroelectric to ferroelectric. The ceramic with x = 0.10 possesses the largest remanent polarization P (r) and thus exhibits the optimum piezoelectric properties, giving d (33) = 71 pC/N, k (p) = 16.6% and k (t) = 39.7%. The ceramics with low doping level of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 are normal ferroelectrics and the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition becomes diffusive gradually with the doping level x of Bi0.5K0.5TiO3 increasing. Our results show the (1-x)NaNbO3-xBi(0.5)K(0.5)TiO(3) ceramics is one of the good candidates for lead-free piezoelectric and ferroelectric materials.

The analytical formula of the nucleation field has been derived. It is found that the nucleation field increases as the interface coupling constant rises. Especially when the thickness of the soft layer is small, the influence of the exchange coupling on the nucleation field is significant. The angular distributions of the magnetization for various exchange coupling constants have been obtained by numerical calculation. It is found that the angular distribution of the magnetization is discontinuous at the interface of the hard and soft layers.

In this model, several point type sources were uniformly distributed around a circle and evaporated simultaneously to form a surface-like source. Based on the Monte Carlo method, the evaporation process was simulated, and the effect of the number of point type sources, circle radius and source-substrate distance on the uniformity was analyzed. Based on the method proposed in this paper, the uniformity of the thickness in the organic layer was successfully controlled in 5%. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Numerical results show that, without Klein tunneling, the time-oscillating behaviors of the transported currents depend on the incident angles of the electrons. How the transmission probabilities related to these transports are influenced by the static potentials, phases, and driven frequencies, etc. are discussed in detail. The essential reasons for these phenomena is the superposition of two equivalent triangular sublattices existing in graphene. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The characteristics of Li4Ti5O12/C composites were determined by X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and thermogravimetric-differential thermal analysis methods. Their electrochemical performances were investigated by cyclic voltammograms, constant current charge-discharge and rate charge-discharge. It was found that molecular weight of polyacrylic acid (PAA), heating rate and sintering duration directly affected the physical and electrochemical performances of Li4Ti5O12/C composites. The Li4Ti5O12/C composites with the optimized electrochemical performances were obtained in the following conditions, i.e., PAA with the molecular weight of 10,000, heating rate of 20 degrees C min(-1) and sintering duration of 8 h. At charge-discharge rate of 4 C and 8 C, the optimized sample showed discharge capacities of 148.4 and 142.4 mAh g(-1), with capacity retention of 94.48 and 90.53% after 50 cycles, respectively.

The calculated results such as lattice constants are in good agreement with experimental data and indicate that the system behaves like metal, while the electrons with up spins occupy the Fermi energy. The influence of quantum size effect is remarkable in the system of small size. It is also found that the sp(2) hybridization and nonbonding electrons play an important part in the single-layer trigonal graphene quantum dots, just like in graphene. The spin multiplicity and magnetic moment of the system increase with the increase of the system size. Based on our calculation, the total magnetic moment of the system mainly comes from the nonbonding electrons on the 2p orbital of the zigzag boundary. Our calculation may be helpful in designing devices based on trigonal graphene quantum dots.

The calculation results indicate that the O defects induced by thermal annealing cannot compensate for the defects caused by neutron irradiation in Ge nanocrystals, while the introduction of As produced by neutron transmutation doping (NTD) will do the jop. We also show that the strong attraction between O and Ge atoms inhibits the formation of vacant defects in Ge nanocrystals, and further improve the luminescent property of Ge-SiO2 system. This suggests that it is necessary to perform thermal annealing for Ge-ncs structures before NTD. Our calculations well support our previous experimental results.

We first generalize the notion of the Yosida approximation in Hilbert spaces introduced by Moudafi to reflexive Banach spaces. Further, by using the notion of the Yosida approximation, we consider a system of parametric generalized Wiener-Hopf equation problems and show its equivalence to the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems. By using a fixed point formulation of the system of parametric generalized Wiener-Hopf equation problems, we study the behavior and sensitivity analysis of a solution set of the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the solution set of the system of parametric generalized mixed implicit equilibrium problems is nonempty, closed and Lipschitz continuous with respect to the parameters.

It is shown that for the two types of beam combination a minimum of the effective radius of curvature, R(min), appears as the propagation distance z increases. For the coherent combination, R is larger than that for the incoherent combination. The position z(min) where the effective radius of curvature reaches its minimum is further away from the source plane for the coherent combination than that for the incoherent combination. For the two types of beam combination, R and z(min) increase with increasing beam number, increasing beam separation distance, increasing waist width, and decreasing beam order and wavelength. In particular, the R of single H-G beams is always smaller than that of H-G array beams; the R of Gaussian array beams is always larger than that of H-G array beams. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

Half-metallic (HM) ferromagnetism is observed in these binary compounds with cell volume optimization. They have a total magnetic moment of 1.000 mu B per formula unit, which is one of the important properties of HM ferromagnets. The ferromagnetic (FM) state is stable forZBScC, ScSi, ScGe and ScSn against the non-magnetic (NM) and antiferromagnetic (AFM) state. Calculations show that half metallicity can be kept for a wide range of lattice constants in these binary compounds.

Compared with the parent molecules unsubstituted, derivatives substituted by CN and NH(2) groups result in higher bond dissociation energies, whereas the other lead to lower ones. The studies indicated that the higher heats of formation of compounds of substituent groups possess, the higher ones of derivatives. The normalized heats of formation of these derivatives substituted by N(4)H(3), NO(2), H, N(2)H, N(4)H, N(3) and CN are 72.6 similar to 108.9 kJ, which is higher than that of triazido-s-triazine (70.2 kJ) reported. For derivatives substituted by N(4)H, N(3)) N(4)H(3), N(2)H and CN groups, heats of formation calculated lie in the range of 871.4 similar to 1159.3 kJ.mo1(-1), but derivatives substituted by N(4)H and N(4)H(3) show low dissociation energies and relatively low stabilities. So derivatives substituted by N(3), N(2)H and CN groups should be applicable as potential of high nitrogen content high energy materials (HNC-HEMs).

For a fixed doping level, with the reduction in R3+ radius, thermopower is found to gradually increase despite the carrier concentration remains unchanged. The scaling behavior between thermopower and electron specific heat coefficient reveals that the additional increase in thermopower originates from enhanced electron correlation which may be attributed to doping-induced chemical pressure.

Micromagnetic calculation of hysteresis loops in exchange-coupled nanolayers	SOLID STATE COMMUNICATIONS			English	Article						Composite magnets; Multilayers; Hysteresis loop; Micromagnetics	POTTS SPIN-LATTICE; REMANENCE ENHANCEMENT; MAGNETIC-PROPERTIES; PERMANENT-MAGNETS; REVERSAL	In this study, hysteresis loops have been investigated based on a self-contained micromagnetic model for various exchange-coupled layer systems, including oriented hard/soft multilayers and double-layer systems with perpendicular easy axes. In the former case, the soft layer acts as the nucleation center while the hard layer plays the role of pinning. Both the nucleation field and coercivity decrease with the thickness of the soft layer L(s) while they are not sensitive to that of the hard one, L(h). The reduction of the remanence due to the deterioration of the squareness of the hysteresis loop accompanying the increase of L(s) could be compensated by the improvement of the saturation magnetization contributed by the soft layer. The optimum thickness at which the largest energy product could be achieved is given. In the latter case, the misaligned layer acts in a similar role to that of the soft layer in hard/soft multilayers considering that it nucleates the reversed domain walls and decreases the coercivity significantly. As the thickness of the misaligned layer increases, both the remanence and the coercivity decrease and the loop loses its rectangularity. As a result, the energy product shrinks, suggesting that the misaligned grains affect the energy product greatly. In the case where the thicknesses of the aligned and misaligned layers are equal and increase simultaneously, the coercivity increases while the remanence decreases. Thus an optimum thickness for largest energy product also exists. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.	[Zhao, G. P.; Guo, N.

In this paper, we investigate these effects on the persistent currents (PCs) in a closed graphene ring with broken time-reversal symmetry. A hard boundary condition is introduced to describe the Dirac electrons moving along such a ring-shaped configuration, and then the induced persistent currents are numerically calculated. Differing from the properties of PCs revealed in the metal AB rings, we show that the present PCs neither show the regular saw-tooth-like features nor present the odd-even symmetry of the electron number. More interestingly, we show that the energy difference between the two valleys and the amplitude of the oscillating PCs increase with the decrease (increase) of the radius (width) of the graphene ring. Our results imply that the AB effect and size-dependent PCs in ring-shaped microstructures could be tested at room temperature.

The results reveal that both resistivity and thermopower increase monotonously with Ti doping. When the relative Ti content is not more than x=0.2, the substitution takes place in Ca2CoO3 sublayer; in contrast, if the relative Ti content reaches x=0.3, the doped Ti ions may exist in both Ca2CoO3 and CoO2 sublayers. As the Co ions in CoO2 layer are substituted, the transport mechanism of the system varies, and the electronic correlation is pronounced enhanced. These changes induce a noticeable increase in thermopower. The figure of merit ZT value of Ca3Co3.7Ti0.3O9 is close to 0.3 at 1000 K, suggesting that Ti doped Ca3Co4O9 series are promising thermoelectric oxides for high-temperature applications.

The notions of C(i)(x)-PC-partially diagonally quasiconvex, C(i)(x)-FC-quasiconvex, and C(i)(x)- FC-quasiconvex-like for set-valued mappings are also introduced in FC-spaces. By applying these notions and a maximal element theorem, the nonemptyness and compactness of solution sets for four classes of systems of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium problems are proved in noncompact FC-spaces. As applications, some new existence theorems of solutions for mathematical programs with system of generalized vector quasi-equilibrium constraints are obtained in PC-spaces.

We analyse the density of states of this system, and our results reveal that the density of states show some noticeable characteristics depending on the relative angle theta of magnetic moment M. and the spin-polarised strength P in ferromagnetic leads, and also the magnetic flux Phi and the number of lattice sites N-R in the mesoscopic ring. These effects might have some potential applications in spintronics.

Effect of Li-substitution on piezoelectric and ferroelectric properties of (Bi0.92Na0.92-xLix)(0.5)Ba0.06Sr0.02TiO3 lead-free ceramics	CURRENT APPLIED PHYSICS			English	Article						Lead-free; Piezoelectric; Ferroelectric; Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3	ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; DEPOLARIZATION TEMPERATURE; DIELECTRIC-PROPERTIES; A-SITE; TRANSITION	New lead-free ceramics (Bi0.92Na0.92-xLix)(0.5)Ba0.06Sr0.02TiO3 have been fabricated by a conventional ceramic technique and their electrical properties have been studied. X-ray diffraction studies reveal that Li+, Ba2+ and Sr2+ diffuse into the Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a pure perovskite structure. The partial substitution of Li+ for Na+ increases the remanent polarization P-r of the ceramics. Because of the large P-r and low coercive field E-c, the ceramics with x = 0.075-0.125 exhibit excellent piezoelectric properties: d(33) = 189-235 pC/N, k(p) = 33.6-36.3% and k(t) = 51.6-54.3%. The ceramics exhibit relaxor behaviors after the substitution of Li+ for Na+. Our results also suggest that polar and non-polar phases may coexist in the ceramics at temperatures above the depolarization temperature T-d. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Our results show that a small amount of MnO2 (0.5-1.0 mol%) is enough to improve the densification of the ceramics and decrease the sintering temperature of the ceramics. The co-effects of MnO2 doping and Sb-substitution lead to significant improvements in the ferroelectric and piezoelectric properties. The K0.5Na0.5Nb0.92Sb0.08O3 ceramic with 0.5 mol%MnO2 doping possesses optimum propeties: d (33) = 187 pC/N, k (P) = 47.2%, epsilon (r) = 980, tan delta = 2.71% and T (c) = 287 A degrees C. Due to high tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transition temperature (T (O-T) similar to 150 A degrees C), the K0.5Na0.5Nb0.92Sb0.08O3 ceramic with 0.5 mol%MnO2 doping exhibits a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

Our results at zero pressure are in good agreement with the available experimental and other theoretical data. The analyses of the structural parameters and elastic constants of VB2 versus pressure suggest that this compound is a very stable material under high pressure and the anisotropies of VB2 will gradually weaken with pressure. Also we present the variation of density of the states (DOS) with applied pressure, and it is found that the density of the states near the Fermi level decreases with pressure, indicating the reduction in the hybridization energy under high pressure. Based on the Mulliken population analysis, we find the charge transferred from V to B increases with pressure. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The calculated lattice constant shows good agreement with the experimental value. It is interestingly found that the band gap energy E-g at the P or X point remarkably increases with increasing pressure, but E-g at the P point does not increase obviously. The pressure coefficient of E-g is calculated to be 44 meV/GPa at the T point. Moreover, the optical properties of rocksalt InN were calculated and discussed based on the calculated band structures and electronic density of states.

It is shown that R decreases due to turbulence. However, position z(min) where R reaches its minimum will change due to the turbulence when the strength of turbulence is strong enough. The effective radius of curvature R increases with the increase of beam coherence parameter beta when the strength of turbulence is weak, while R decreases with beta increasing when the strength of turbulence is strong. The R decreases slowly with the increase of beam order M(N) The R of partially coherent flat-topped beam with larger beta and smaller M ( N) is more sensitive to turbulence. In addition, in free space the wavefront of partially coherent flat-topped beam can be regarded as a spherical surface in the far-field, which is independent of the beam parameters However, in turbulence the effective radius of curvature depends on the beam parameters in the near field and also in the far field.

Our results show that for collimated beams, when examined against propagation length, the dark hollow, flat topped and annular Gaussian beams behave nearly the same as the Gaussian beam, but have larger radius of curvature values. Increased partial coherence and turbulence levels tend to lower the radius of curvature. Bigger source sizes on the other hand give rise to larger radius of curvature. Dark hollow and flat topped beams have reduced radius of curvature at longer wavelengths, whereas the annular Gaussian beam seems to be unaffected by wavelength changes; the radius of curvature of the Gaussian beam meanwhile rises with increasing wavelength.

Theoretical investigation on the detected probe waveshape has been performed by using the probe-pump coupled equations combined with Raman amplification. The experimental characterization has been demonstrated to validate the theoretical prediction. The results show that, the 75 Km sensing distance can be achieved by utilizing the bi-directional Raman amplification with measurement accuracy of +/- 0.6 degrees C over the whole sensing fiber. The larger Raman power and Brillouin pump power are helpful to improve the sensing signal-noise ratio (SNR). There exists an optimum range for the input probe power and the extinction ratio (ER) of input Brillouin pump pulse. The BOTDA with Raman amplification has considerable potentials to realize long-distance strain and temperature measurement for structural health monitoring and fire alarming, etc.	[Jia, Xin-Hong; Rao, Yun-Jiang; Chang, Liang; Zhang, Chao; Ran, Zeng-Ling] Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Key Lab Opt Fiber Sensing & Commun, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China; [Jia, Xin-Hong] Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Peoples R China; [Rao, Yun-Jiang] Chongqing Univ, Key Lab Optoelect Technol & Syst, Chongqing 400044, Peoples R China	Rao, YJ (reprint author), Univ Elect Sci & Technol China, Key Lab Opt Fiber Sensing & Commun, Chengdu 610054, Peoples R China.	jxh_0@yahoo.com.cn; yjrao@uestc.edu.cn	rao, yunjiang/C-4249-2016		Education Ministry of ChinaMinistry of Education, China [A090101 012006 0614 017]; Sichuan Provincial Education Department [09ZB060]	This paper was supported by the Ph.D. Base Fund of the Education Ministry of China A090101 012006 0614 017, and also was supported by Scientific Research Fund of Sichuan Provincial Education Department No. 09ZB060.		20	39	46	1	9	IEEE-INST ELECTRICAL ELECTRONICS ENGINEERS INC	PISCATAWAY	445 HOES LANE, PISCATAWAY, NJ 08855-4141 USA	0733-8724	1558-2213		J LIGHTWAVE TECHNOL	J.

Structure and piezoelectric properties of new ternary K0.5Na0.5NbO3-LiSbO3-CaTiO3 lead-free piezoceramics	JOURNAL OF MATERIALS SCIENCE-MATERIALS IN ELECTRONICS			English	Article							POTASSIUM-SODIUM NIOBATE; ELECTRICAL-PROPERTIES; CERAMICS; BEHAVIOR	New ternary (1-x)K0.5Na0.5NbO3-x(0.80LiSbO(3)-0.20CaTiO(3)) lead-free ceramics were fabricated by a conventional ceramic technique and their structure and piezoelectric properties were studied. The results of X-ray diffraction reveal that LiSbO3 and CaTiO3 diffuse into the K0.5Na0.5NbO3 lattices to form a new solid solution with a perovskite structure. After the addition of LiSbO3 and CaTiO3, the cubic-tetragonal and tetragonal-orthorhombic phase transitions shift to lower temperatures. Coexistence of the orthorhombic and tetragonal phases is hence formed in the ceramics with 0.03 < x < 0.07 at room temperature, leading to a significant enhancement of the piezoelectric properties. For the ceramics with x = 0.04-0.06, the piezoelectric properties become optimum: d (33) = 172-253 pC/N, k (P) = 49.9-55.5%, k (t) = 49.2-52.1% and T (C) = 348-373 A degrees C. The ceramic with x = 0.04 also exhibits a good thermal stability of piezoelectric properties.

FTIR and Raman spectra suggest that the >NH lone pair in PUDS can interact with the Pr3+ centers. DSC results show that the coordination effect causes a significant increase of the phase transition temperature. The emission spectrum of Pr-PUDS indicates an efficient energy transfer from the macromolecular ligand to the coordinated Pr3+ ion. The magnetic behavior as function of applied magnetic field or temperature (50-450 degrees C) and some unusual transitions in the M versus T plots are reported and discussed, which demonstrate that the magnetic properties of the Pr-PUDS strongly depend on the phase transition.

J	Li, XQ; Ji, XL; Yang, F				Li, Xiaoqing; Ji, Xiaoling; Yang, Fan			Beam quality of radial Gaussian Schell-model array beams	OPTICS AND LASER TECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beam; Rayleigh range; M-2-factor	PARTIALLY COHERENT BEAMS; LASER ARRAY; RAYLEIGH RANGE; ATMOSPHERIC-TURBULENCE; PROPAGATION; COMBINATIONS	Taking the Rayleigh range Z(R) and the M-2-factor as the characteristic parameters of beam quality, the beam quality of radial Gaussian Schell-model (GSM) array beams is studied. The analytical expressions for the Z(R) and the M-2-factor of radial GSM array beams are derived. It is shown that for the superposition of the cross-spectral density function Z(R) is longer and the M-2-factor is lower than that for the superposition of the intensity. For the two types of superposition, Z(R) increases and the M-2-factor decreases with increase in beam coherence parameter, and both Z(R) and the M-2-factor increase with increase in inverse radial fill-factor. For the superposition of the cross-spectral density function, Z(R) increases and the M-2-factor decreases with increase in beam number, while for the superposition of the intensity both the Z(R) and M-2-factor are independent of the beam number.

How thick SiO2 cap layer is needed to achieve strong visible photoluminescence from SiO2-buffered SiNx films?	PHYSICA E-LOW-DIMENSIONAL SYSTEMS & NANOSTRUCTURES			English	Article						SiNx film; SiO2; Annealing; Photoluminescence	DEFECT SPECTRUM; SILICON; LUMINESCENCE; MORPHOLOGY; ORIGIN	The effect of a SiO2 nanolayer and annealing temperature on the UV/visible room-temperature photoluminescence (PL) from SiNx films synthesized by rf magnetron sputtering is studied. The PL intensity can be maximized when the SiO2 layer is 5-10 nm thick at 800 degrees C annealing temperature and only 2 nm at 1000 degrees C. A composition-structure-property analysis reveals that the PL intensity is directly related to both the surface chemical states and the content of the Si-0 and Si-N bonds in the SiNx, films. These results are relevant for the development of advanced optoelectronic and photonic emitters and sensors. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	[Xu, M.; Chen, Q.

The effects of the thickness of the semiconductor layers and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling on the spin-dependent tunneling transmission coefficient and the properties of the tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) are studied. It is found that the variations of tunneling transmission coefficients and the tunnel magnetoresistance TMR with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and the thickness of semiconductor layer, show typical resonant properties and the TMR can be enhanced and its sign can switch from positive to negative by increasing the ratio of Rashba spin-orbit coupling strength between two semiconductor layers.

Here, by using quantum waveguide theory and the Floquet theorem we investigate the quantum transport of electrons along an open mesoscopic ring threaded by a time-periodic magnetic flux. We predicate that current density waves could be excited along such an open ring. As a consequence, a net current could be generated along the lead with only one reservoir, if the lead additionally connects to such a normal-metal loop driven by the time-dependent flux. These phenomena could be explained by photon-assisted processes, due to the interaction between the transported electrons and the applied oscillating external fields. We also discuss how the time-average currents (along the ring and the lead) depend on the amplitude and frequency of the applied oscillating fluxes.

Here, we introduce a time-evolution operator method to investigate such a problem by numerically solving the induced algebraic equations (by Runge-Kutta method). Based on these calculations, transitions between two levels driven by various time-dependent external fields can be simulated in detail, typically near the so-called avoided crossing points.

By constructing a type of cross-constrained variational problem and establishing the so-called cross invariant manifolds, we obtain a sharp threshold for blowup and global existence of the solution to the equation under study which is different from that in [10].

In this paper, the problem of near optimum test points set selection for analog fault dictionary is considered. This problem is formulated as a depth-first graph search problem. So the test points selection progress is transformed to a graph node expanding progress. The graph node construction method and node expanding procedure are given also. The proposed graph search method guarantee a maximum information increase of S (opt) by adding a test point to S (opt) each time, where S (opt) is the desired test points set used on the path from current node to root node. So a global minimum test points set can be more likely achieved than other methods. The results of statistical experiments indicate that the proposed method more accurately finds the global minimum set of test points without increasing time complexity; therefore, it is a good solution to minimize the size of test points set.

The vibrational frequencies have been studied at the same level to analyze these complexes. Six and eleven stable structures for the catechin-H2O and catechin-(H2O)(2) have been found, respectively. Theories of atoms in molecules (AIM) and natural bond orbital (NBO) have been utilized to investigate the hydrogen bonds involved in all the systems. The interaction energies of all the complexes corrected by basis set superposition error, are from -13.27 to -83.56 kJ/mol. All calculations also indicate that there are strong hydrogen-bonding interactions in catechin-water complexes. The strong hydrogen-bonding contributes to the interaction energies dominantly. The O-H stretching motions in all the complexes are red-shifted relative to that of the monomer.

In this paper, we study how to extract knowledge from vague objective information systems (VOISs) based on rough sets theory. We first introduce the basic notion termed rough vague sets by combining rough sets theory and vague sets theory. By using the rough vague lower approximation distribution in the VOIS, the concept of attribute reduction is introduced. Then, we develop an algorithm based on a discernibility matrix to compute all the attribute reductions. Finally, a viable approach for extracting decision rules from the VOIS is proposed. An example is also presented to illustrate the application of the proposed theories and approaches in handling medical diagnosis problems.

J	Zhou, ZR; Feng, G; Zhang, YD; Li, LM				Zhou, Zhaorong; Feng, Gang; Zhang, Yide; Li, Lemin			On feasibility examination of DS-CDMA systems with imperfect successive interference cancellation	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEMS			English	Article						DS-CDMA; successive interference cancellation (SIC); decoding order; computational complexity	POWER-CONTROL	In DS-CDMA systems with the successive interference cancellation (SIC) technique, there are K! possible decoding orders for K active users and the decoding order has considerable impact on system performance. Once the constraints on the received powers of mobile stations and the bit-energy-to-interference-power-spectral-density ratio requirements are satisfied under some decoding order of SIC, the system is feasible. Otherwise, if the constraints are violated under all possible decoding orders, the system is infeasible. It is highly time-consuming to examine the system feasibility directly by using the usual exhaustive search method (ESM) for a system with even moderate number of users. In this paper, we propose an efficient approach for examining the feasibility of DS-CDMA systems with imperfect SIC. The proposed approach has significantly lower computational complexity than that of ESM and thus benefits the quick decisions of admission control and/or scheduling, which are essential for Quality of Service provisioning in DS-CDMA systems. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that the system under the resultant decoding order obtained by the proposed approach is able to achieve the lowest outage probability among all possible decoding orders. We conduct extensive simulation experiments, and the numerical results validate our analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
