These observations may imply that possible structural-transitions can exist with the variation of the temperature. In this letter we report the presence of temperature driven structural-transitions in the temperature range from 298.15 to 673.15 K measured under magic-angle HOPG (0.8 degrees; +/- 0.2 degrees, first magic-angle). Novel memory effects consisting in an anomalous reversible linear increase of the c-axis unit cell values of HOPG with the increase of the temperature are described. (c) 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

As the generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs), the Pythagorean fuzzy set (PFS) is more useful in expressing fuzzy and ambiguous information. Meanwhile, in order to consider human hesitance, dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets (DHPFSs) are presented, which can be more valid for handling real multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems. To fuse the information in DHPFSs more effectively, in this article, some dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy Heronian mean operators, which can consider the relationships between arguments being fused, are defined and studied. Evidently, the new proposed operators can obtain more exact results than other existing methods. In addition, some important properties of these Heronian mean (HM) operators are discussed. Subsequently, the defined aggregation operators are used in MADM with dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (DHPFNs), and the MADM model is developed. In accordance with the defined operators and the built model, the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy generalized weighted Heronian mean (DHPFGWHM) operator and dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy generalized geometric weighted Heronian mean (DHPFGGWHM) operator are applied to deal with the green supplier selection in supply chain management, and the availability and superiority of the proposed operators are analyzed by comparing them with some existing approaches. The method presented in this paper can effectively solve the MADM problems in which the decision-making information is expressed by DHPFNs and the attributes are interactive.

Dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets (DHPFSs) provide a useful tool to depict the uncertain and fuzzy cognitions of the decision makers over attributes. To effectively handle such common cases, in this paper, some Bonferroni mean (BM) operators under DHPFS environment are proposed and some methods for multiple attribute decision-making (MADM) problems based on the BM operators with dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy numbers (DHPFNs) are investigated. Firstly, some new BM operators to aggregate dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy cognitive information are developed, which consider the interrelationship of DHPFNs, and can generate more accurate results than the existing dual Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators. Then, the developed aggregation operator is applied to MADM with DHPFNs and two MADM methods are designed, which can be applied to different decision-making situations. Based on the proposed operators and built models, two methods are developed to solve the MADM problems with DHPFNs and the validity and advantages of the proposed method are analyzed by comparison with some existing approaches. The methods proposed in this paper can effectively handle the MADM problems in which the attribute information is expressed by DHPFNs, the attributes' weights are completely known, and the attributes are interactive.

In this paper, we present the absorption of a nonperiodic cavity chain, where the absorption value on the resonance point shows switchable dips or peaks, according to whether the optomechanical interaction is at an odd or even-numbered position in the chain. Meanwhile, the value of absorption due to the optomechanical interaction varies with the number of the bare cavities. The calculated results may have some novel applications, such as detecting the position of the movable mirror in a long cavity chain, which would be useful in quantum information processing based on optomechanical systems.

Discovering the relationship between the tropical forest biomass of Xishuangbanna and Landsat TM data is very important for depicting the tropical forest biomass by using remote sensing. The study aimed to (1) discover the relationship between tropical forest biomass and Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images in Xishuangbanna Prefecture, Yunnan Province, China, by using forest permanent plot data and correlation analysis; (2) explore how to improve the relationship by using topographic correction models such as the Lambert cosine correction model (LCCM) and the sun-canopy-sensor topographic correction model (SCSTCM). The results revealed the tropical forest biomass characteristics and the relationship characteristics between the tropical forest biomass and Landsat TM data and its improvement by using LCCM and SCSTCM. The results are beneficial to monitoring the tropical forest biomass variation in Xishuangbanna.

The simulation is performed using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations in conjunction with multi- scale shock technique (MSST). By calculating the microscopic electronic properties and combining the thermodynamic properties, we predict that the metallization pressure of the RDX crystal is approximately 170 GPa under shock loading, which is slightly less than the metallization pressure under hydrostatic pressure. We also found that the microscopic electronic properties are related to the impact sensitivity. When the shock loading is along the z direction, the time of the transition from the insulating state to the metallization of the RDX crystal lags behind the shock loading along the x or y direction. Therefore, we predict that the RDX crystal has a lower sensitivity when the shock loading is along the z direction.

The participants were assessed using children's revised impact of event scale (CRIES) and short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ), after which t tests, Chi square tests, and a multivariate logistic regression were conducted to examine the differences in the LBC and identify the associated predictors. It was found that the PTSD and depressive symptom prevalences were 13.10% and 20.75%, with the LBC having a significantly higher prevalence than the non-LBC. The PTSD and depression symptoms tended to be highly comorbid (r=.52, p<.001). Being female, being aged less than 15, having siblings, being an LBC, and having higher exposure were found to be associated with PTSD and depressive symptoms.

Both enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) at the macrocell base station (MBS) and resource allocation (RA) at small cell base station (SBS) have been considered as efficient approaches to mitigate the cross-tier interference. In this paper, we propose a distributed optimization framework to jointly optimize the eICIC and RA schemes at different tiers. In specific, an enhanced almost blank subframe (ABS) scheme is performed by the MBS to encourage SBSs to adopt hybrid access policy and admit the offloaded macrocell users (MUs) so as to guarantee their QoS requirements. To model the intricate interaction between two tiers, we formulate the joint optimization problem as a one-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game. We prove the existence of Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) and obtain the optimal strategies for both tiers. Numerical results are presented to show that the proposed framework with hybrid access policy converges to a unique SE and utilities for both tiers is maximized, which creates a win-win situation.

In this work, an -hemolytic strain, designated LQJ-218, was isolated from the human oral cavity and evaluated for its ability to produce exopolysaccharides. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that this strain is a potentially novel species belonging to the mitis group streptococci. Whole-genome sequence-based analysis indicated that the genome sequence of Streptococcus sp. LQJ-218 was 1,935,194bp in length, with a mol% G+C content of 40.0, and contained 1897 coding DNA sequences and 91 RNA genes. Furthermore, four biosynthetic gene clusters relevant to exopolysaccharide production were identified in the genome. Both digital DNA-DNA hybridization (yielding a value of 56.60% between strain LQJ-218 and its nearest relative S. mitis) and average nucleotide identity analysis (revealing 91.29% identity of LQJ-218 with its nearest relative S. mitis) suggested that strain LQJ-218 should be classified as a novel Streptococcus species. This potentially novel strain may possess great potential for contributing to the development of new exopolysaccharides. The present study provides valuable genetic information that may be useful in comparative genomics and biotechnological applications.

This paper considers the problem of how to estimate the two common remainders from their residue sets modulo a set of moduli. To measure the errors properly under the modular operation, we introduce two type circular distances. Based on these circular distances, two estimation methods are proposed by properly grouping the erroneous remainders into two ordered clusters. Both of the two methods perform better with lower computational complexities than the existing methods. In this paper, theoretical analysis as well as analytical results for the two proposed methods are obtained. For the first method, the two optimal estimates are proved to be in a finite set with no more than L candidates, where L is the number of the given moduli. The second method have closed forms. Simulation results show that the two proposed methods have nearly the same performance. These optimal estimates can improve the performance of the robust generalized CRT significantly.

Due to the complex construction structure of underground laboratory engineering and the difficulty of project implementation, how to effectively plan, design and evaluate underground laboratory construction projects is an important issue in the construction of underground laboratories. Based on geometric structure, topological relationship and geological semantics, this paper integrates multi-source data from underground laboratories and constructs a 3D digital model of underground laboratory. The 3D data visualization system of underground laboratory of immersed high-level waste geological disposal was constructed by using terrain automatic generation algorithm, perspective and section in 3D model visualization, and immersive interactive means of viewpoint positioning. The experimental results show that the system can provide an intuitive interactive means for the comprehensive analysis of underground laboratory data, and provide reference for the demonstration of underground laboratory engineering construction planning and design.

This paper studies the problem of scheduling the minimum charging vehicles to charge lifetime-critical sensors in a wireless rechargeable sensor network, by utilizing the breakthrough wireless charging technology. Existing studies still employ a number of charging vehicles to charge sensors. The purchase cost of a charging vehicle however is not inexpensive. To further reduce the number of employed charging vehicles, we propose a novel approximation algorithm, by exploring the combinatorial properties of the problem. The techniques exploited in this paper are essentially different from that in existing studies. Not only do we show that the approximation ratio of the proposed algorithm is much better than that of the state-of-the-art, but also extensive experimental results demonstrate that the number of scheduled charging vehicles by the proposed algorithm is at least 10% less than that by the existing algorithms and the total travel energy consumption of the charging vehicles is also smaller than that by the existing algorithms.

Change of coercivity mechanism with the soft film thickness in hard-soft trilayers	JOURNAL OF MAGNETISM AND MAGNETIC MATERIALS			English	Article						Coercivity mechanism; Nucleation; Pinning; Hard/soft multilayers; Micromagnetics	ANISOTROPIC NANOCOMPOSITE FILMS; ENERGY PRODUCT; EXCHANGE; NUCLEATION	Coercivity mechanism has been studied intensively and debated for many years in magnetic materials, particularly in permanent magnets where defects play important roles in adjusting the coercivity. Such a role can be manifested in hard/soft multilayers, where the soft layer can be taken as an enlarged soft defect, which normally exists in so-called single-phased permanent magnets. In this paper, hysteresis loops and spin distributions have been obtained based on both three-dimensional (3D) and one-dimensional (1D) micromagnetic methods for SmCo/Fe to reveal the in-depth coercivity mechanism. Two different geometric models have been constructed to mimic the experimental trilayers, in one of which a transition layer between hard and soft layers is adopted, where calculated nucleation fields and coercivity match very well with the experimental data. As the soft layer thickness increases, both nucleation and coercive fields reduce whilst the coercivity mechanism changes from nucleation to pinning. Such a pinning is inherently related to nucleation and has both attributes of traditional nucleation and pinning, called as a hybrid coercivity mechanism here. The thickness-dependent coercivity mechanism obtained in this work agrees perfectly with the experimental data, which is general for all hard/soft composites and can be extended to single-phased permanent magnets where defects are inevitable.

One of the most promising renewable energy is viewed as solar energy resources due to its cleanliness and the inexhaustibility. However, the quantitative assessment method on the reliability of a complicated solar energy generating system has been a considerable challenge. In this paper, we propose a Markov model to imitate a solar energy generating system with inverters in series, unreliable by-pass change-over switches, and common cause failure. Employing the renewal point technique and the Semi-Markov process theory, we build the quantitative reliability models of the system. Further, we develop a new algorithm to obtain the explicit form solution of reliability indices. An example illustrates that the proposed models and the algorithm are efficient and concise.

This improvement significantly relies on the microstructure and electrical properties of GO, which nevertheless is rarely studied. Here, multiscale GOs with different flake sizes and oxidation degrees were fabricated and incorporated into waterborne alkyd resin (AR). The physical and chemical structures of GO and AR/GO composites were characterized in detail. Multiscale GOs are successfully prepared, and the corrosion resistance of AR/GO coatings is measured by electrochemical workstation. Electrochemical experiments indicate that GOs with larger flake sizes have excellent barrier properties due to the shielding effect; GOs with appropriate oxidation degrees could effectively improve the dispersion of GO and avoid the conductive path of GO in the matrix, because oxidation degree of GO could influence the dispersion and electrical properties. The corrosion protection efficiency of AR/GO(GO: 120 mu m, 1.5 wt%, sp(2)/sp(3) 5 2.61) is 98.14%, which is 2.26 times higher than AR. The multiscale effects of GO on the corrosion resistance property of AR coatings are quite general, thus providing guidelines for developing highly efficient corrosion resistant coatings for practical usage.

However, its performance is largely limited by the low density and poor reactivity of active sites within its basal plane. Here, we report that domain boundaries in the basal plane of monolayer MoS2 can greatly enhance its hydrogen evolution reaction performance by serving as active sites. Two types of effective domain boundaries, the 2H-2H domain boundaries and the 2H-1T phase boundaries, were investigated. Superior hydrogen evolution reaction catalytic activity, long-term stability and universality in both acidic and alkaline conditions were achieved based on a multi-hierarchy design of these two types of domain boundaries. We further demonstrate that such superior catalysts are feasible at a large scale by applying this multi-hierarchy design of domain boundaries to wafer-scale monolayer MoS2 films.

Electrocatalytic N-2-to-NH3 fixation under ambient conditions is an attractive approach to reduce energy consumption and avoid direct carbon emission. In this communication, sulfur-doped graphene (S-G) is proposed as an efficient and stable electrocatalyst to drive the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient conditions. In 0.1 M HCl, this S-G attains a remarkably large NH3 yield of 27.3 mu g h(-1) mg(cat).(-1) and a high Faradaic efficiency of 11.5% at -0.6 and -0.5 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, much higher than those of undoped G (6.25 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1); 0.52%). Density functional theory calculations reveal that carbon atoms close to substituted sulfur atoms are the underlying catalytic active sites for the NRR on S-G, and the related NRR mechanism is also explored.

Rietveld analyses of XRD data confirmed that the sample belongs to hexagonal crystal (space group of P31c, No:159). The refined structural parameters are in agreement with the available theoretical and synchrotron radiation experimental results. Then, the infrared (IR) spectra of alpha-Si3N4 under 22 GPa were investigated with the diamond anvil cell (DAC). According to the IR absorption spectra at 296.3 K and 2 hPa (Observation range from 400 cm to 12,500 cm(-1)) we observed 23 IR active peaks. Normalized Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) absorption spectra under high pressure and room-temperature (296.3 K) show that alpha-Si3N4 undergoes a phase transition at 16.3 GPa and changes from hexagonal to cubic phase, namely, gamma-Si3N4, which is very close to the result of our theoretical calculations, i.e., the phase transition pressure is 16.3 GPa.

Herein, we develop a general cascade anchoring strategy for the mass production of a series of M-NC SACs with a metal loading up to 12.1 wt%. Systematic investigation reveals that the chelation of metal ions, physical isolation of chelate complex upon high loading, and the binding with N-species at elevated temperature are essential to achieving high-loading M-NC SACs. As a demonstration, high-loading Fe-NC SAC shows superior electrocatalytic performance for O-2 reduction and Ni-NC SAC exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction. The strategy paves a universal way to produce stable M-NC SAC with high-density metal-N-x sites for diverse high-performance applications.

By calculating the noise spectrum of the output field, it is found that two squeezing dips appear symmetrically located about the resonant point. Besides the contribution from the destructive interference between the noise fluctuation of the input field and its optomechanically modified one, the major part of the squeezing is transferred from the squeezed vacuum injected in the cavity. Additionally, it is shown that the adverse effects of the environment temperature on the output spectrum can he strongly suppressed by the injected squeezed field. This study can he useful in quantum communications via the optomechanical interface. (C) 2019 Optical Society of America under the terms of the OSA Open Access Publishing Agreement.

Experimental study elucidates that humic acid molecular ligand with different metal elements has different abilities to accept electrons. By using density functional theory, this article selected the leonardite humic acid (LHA) organic macromolecule as ligand to study interactions between the ligand and different metals. At the same time, the calculation of binding energy, the analysis of characteristics for the complex structure and the distribution of frontier molecular orbital were also completed. On the basis of Marcus theory, the reorganization energy, matrix element and charge transport rate constant were calculated. The results show that the order of the charge transfer rates is Fe3+ > Cu2+ > Al3+ for different metal complexes, and are in good agreement with the experimental ones.

J	Liu, X; Mao, PN; Li, LH; Ma, J				Liu, Xiang; Mao, Peini; Li, Lanhai; Ma, Jie			Impact of biochar application on yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity: A meta-analysis	SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT			English	Review						Biochar; Greenhouse gas intensity; Global warming; Food security; Agricultural ecosystem; Meta-analysis	OXIDE N2O EMISSIONS; SOIL CARBON; PYROLYSIS TEMPERATURE; GLOBAL METAANALYSIS; CHEMICAL-PROPERTIES; SLOW PYROLYSIS; CROP YIELD; NITROGEN; FERTILIZER; AMENDMENT	The application of biochar to agricultural ecosystems is a potential solution to mitigate climate change and guarantee food security. However, the impacts of biochar on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield are usually evaluated separately and the results are contradictory in individual studies. In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted based on data from 28 peer-reviewed studies to quantify the impacts of biochar application on greenhouse gas emissions and crop yield using yield-scaled greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). Potential factors (experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar) influencing the effect of biochar on yield-scaled GHGI were explored. The results showed that overall, biochar significantly reduced yield-scaled GHGI by 29%. The reductions in yield-scaled GHGI induced by biochar varied with different experimental conditions and properties of soil and biochar. However, the difference was only significant between the two cropping systems, with significantly greater reduction being observed in dry lands (-41%) than in paddy fields (-17%). Therefore, it is suggested that biochar amendment in dry lands may bring more environmental and agronomic benefits than that in paddy fields. The response of crop yield to biochar application further implied that biochar made from crop residue, biochar produced at low pyrolysis temperatures (<= 400 degrees C), and biochar with high pH (>9.0) might contribute to save the production cost of biochar while promoting crop yield in agricultural ecosystems. Long-term field trials are required to elucidate the persistence of the impact of biochar on reducing yield-scaled GHGI and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. The balance between the price of biochar production and the benefits brought by biochar should also be focused in further studies. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Ultraviolet photons have been shown to generate deep trapping electronic defects in mesoporous TiO2-based perovskite, affecting its performance and stability. In this study, the structural, electronic, and optical properties of the cubic, tetragonal, and hexagonal phases of MASnI(3) were studied using first-principles calculations. The results indicate that the hexagonal phase of MASnI(3) possesses a larger indirect bandgap and a larger carrier effective mass along the c-axis compared to the cubic and tetragonal phases. These findings were attributed to enhanced electronic coupling and localization in the hexagonal phase. Moreover, the hexagonal phase exhibited high absorption of ultraviolet photons and high transmission of visible photons, particularly along the caxis. These characteristics demonstrate the potential of hexagonal MASnI(3) for application in multijunction perovskite tandem solar cells or as coatings in mesoporous TiO2-based perovskite solar cells to enhance ultraviolet stability and photon utilization.

First, we briefly reviewed the definition of P2TLSs and introduced the score function, accuracy function, and operational laws of P2TLNs. Then, we combined the traditional EDAS model for multiple criteria group decision making (MCGDM) with P2TLNs. Our presented model was more accurate and effective for considering the conflicting attributes. Finally, a numerical case for green supplier selection was given to illustrate this new model, and some comparisons were also conducted between the picture 2-tuple linguistic weighted averaging (P2TLWA), picture 2-tuple linguistic weighted geometric (P2TLWG) aggregation operators and EDAS model with P2TLNs, to further illustrate the advantages of the new method.

In this work, centimeter-scale layered MoS2 films with different layer numbers are achieved by using pulsed laser deposition by controlling the number of laser pulses. The measurement of transport characteristics in the dark indicates a Schottky barrier contact formed at the Au/MoS2 interface. The obtained metal-semiconductor-metal MoS2 based photodetectors present a UV-to-NIR photoresponse with high stability. When the thickness of the film is decreased, the photoresponse of the MoS2 photodetectors gradually increases from multilayer to bilayer, and more importantly, a notable enhancement in the photoresponse for the monolayer can be observed. In particular, a photoresponsivity of 1.96 A W-1 is achieved in monolayer MoS2 samples under illumination with a wavelength of 300 nm. The physical mechanism responsible for the observation is discussed based on the layer dependent Schottky barrier variation and the indirect-to-direct energy band transition in MoS2. Our work provides an insight into layer-dependent optical behavior in MoS2 films, which should be helpful for developing further large-scale photosensing applications in the atomic limit.

Enhancers are difficult to identify because they lack positional constraints relative to their cognate genes. Excitingly, several recent studies showed that plant enhancers can be predicted based on their distinct features associated with open chromatin. However, experimental validation is necessary to confirm the predicted enhancer function.ResultsWe developed a rapid enhancer validation system based on Nicotiana benthamiana. A set of 12 intergenic and intronic enhancers, identified in Arabidopsis thaliana, were cloned into a vector containing a minimal 35S promoter and a luciferase reporter gene, and were then infiltrated into N. benthamiana leaves mediated by agrobacterium. The enhancer activity of each candidate was quantitatively assayed based on bioluminescence measurement. The data from this luciferase-based validation was correlated with previous data derived from transgenic assays in A. thaliana. In addition, the relative strength of different enhancers for driving the reporter gene can be quantitatively compared. We demonstrate that this system can also be used to map the functional activity of a candidate enhancer under different environmental conditions.ConclusionsIn summary, we developed a rapid and efficient plant enhancer validation system based on a luciferase reporter and N. benthamiana-based leaf agroinfiltration. This system can be used for initial screening of leaf-specific enhancers and for validating candidate leaf enhancers from dicot species. It can potentially be used to examine the activity of candidate enhancers under different environmental conditions.

The thermodynamics test results revealed that the triphenylene meso-substituted-boron-dipyrromethene possesses the highest thermal stability comparing with the boron-dipyrromethene compounds which meso-position has been substituted by triphenylamine or tetraphenylethylene. The thermal decomposition temperature and melting point of triphenylene meso-substituted-boron-dipyrromethene are up to 369 degrees C and 297 degrees C, respectively. The UV-Vis absorption spectra, fluorescence emission spectra and quantum chemical calculations indicated the significant intramolecular charge transfer characteristic from Donor (triphenylene) to Acceptor (BODIPY) moiety.

The formation of coordination cages occurred simultaneously with the condensation of amino groups and ketone. The remarkable structural feature of cages 1-4 is their spontaneous incorporation of [Ag-Ag](2+) cationic units. Moreover, the argentophilic interactions are modulated by the uncoordinated amino substituents. The study herein shows that modification and subtle changes of the cage structures could be realized by a one-pot synthetic method.

Epoxide hydrolases have been exploited in biocatalysis for kinetic resolution of racemic epoxides to produce enantiopure epoxides and vicinal diols. It is necessary to obtain sufficient stable epoxide hydrolases with high enantioselectivity to meet the requirements of industry. Objectives: Enhancement of soluble expression and biochemical characterization of epoxide hydrolases from Bacillus pumilus and B. subtilis. Material and Methods: Homologous genes encoding epoxide hydrolases from B. pumilus and B. subtilis were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The recombinant epoxide hydrolases were characterized biochemically. Results: Low temperature induction of expression and a C-terminal-fused His-tag enhanced soluble expression of the epoxide hydrolases from the two Bacillus species in E. coli. These epoxide hydrolases could hydrolyze various epoxide substrates, with stereosetectivity toward some epoxides such as styrene oxide and glycidyl tosylate. Conclusions: The position of the His-tag and the induction temperature were found to play a vital role in soluble expression of these two epoxide hydrolases in E. coli. In view of their catalytic properties, the epoxide hydrolases from Bacillus have potential for application in kinetic resolution of some epoxides to prepare enantiopure epoxides and vicinal diols.

It has been confirmed to improve the symptoms of diabetes and diabetic complications effectively. Like other flavonoids, the bioavailability challenge of PHZ is the wide phase I and II metabolism in the digestive tract. In this study, we investigated the pharmacokinetics and contribution of phase II metabolism after the oral and intravenous administrations of PHZ in rats having type 2 diabetes (T2D) and in normal rats. The phase II metabolism characteristics of PHZ were investigated by treating plasma samples with -glucuronidase/sulfatase. The contribution ratio of phase II metabolism of PHZ ranged from 41.9% to 69.0% after intravenous injection with three doses of PHZ in normal rats. Compared with the observations for normal rats, AUC(0-t) and C-max of PHZ significantly increased and T-1/2 of PHZ significantly decreased in T2D rats. PHZ was converted into phloretin (PHT) through an enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis reaction, and PHT was further transformed into conjugates with glycose after both oral and intravenous administrations. Moreover, it was found that the bioavailability of PHZ was about 5% in T2D rats, which was significantly higher than that in normal rats (0%). In conclusion, compared with the observations for normal rats, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of PHZ significantly changed in T2D rats through oral and intravenous administrations. The bioavailability of PHZ significantly increased in T2D rats. Besides, the phase II metabolites of PHT were the major existing forms in blood after oral and intravenous administrations. Our results indicated that the phase II metabolism characteristics of PHZ should be considered when PHZ is applied for the treatment of diabetes as a drug or functional food.

Due to the existence of multiple agents in ETMM, the supervision strategy for these agents is usually difficult to formulate. In this study, a quadruplicate HSR safety supervision system evolutionary game model composed of an HSR company and three agents was established through the analysis of the complex game relationship existing in the system. The behavioral characteristics and the steady state of decision-making of all stakeholders involved in the system are proved by evolutionary game theory and system dynamics simulation. The results show that there will be long-term fluctuations in the strategies selected by the four stakeholders in the static reward-penalty control scenario (RPCS), which indicates that an evolutionary stable strategy does not exist. With increases in the reward-penalty coefficient, the fluctuations are intensified. Therefore, the dynamic RPCS was proposed to control the fluctuations, and the simulation was repeated. The results show that the fluctuations can be effectively restrained by adopting the dynamic RPCS, but if the coefficients are the same, the static RPCS is better than the dynamic RPCS for increasing the safety investment rate of the three agents. This demonstrates that the HSR company should apply these two control scenarios flexibly according to the actual situation when formulating a supervision strategy in order to effectively control and enhance the safety level of HSR operations when multiple agents are involved.

Thus, there is a large difference between evacuation results and the real-life behaviors of crowds when emotion has not been considered in the evacuation model. There are some challenges to generate more realistic simulation results of crowd evacuations area: (1) how to portray the effect of individuals' emotions in evacuation process under various situations; (2) how the third party roles (such as policemen) affect the emotion of the crowd and guide the evacuation. We present an emotion based simulation framework for complex evacuation scenarios. Each individual is modeled as an agent given different emotions, and its emotion has impacts on three aspects: moving speed, the desired goal and path planning. To handle the second challenge, the third party roles can suppress the negative emotions of evacuation crowd and provide suitable exits for the agents around them.

(family Chenopodiaceae) is native to Central and South America. Introduced C. ambrosioides poses threat to ecosystems in China. To explore allelopathy mechanism, effects of volatile allelochemicals produced by C. ambrosioides on maize root border cells (RBCs) were tested. C. ambrosioides volatile oil and its two main components (alpha-terpinene and cymene), inhibited the maize root growth, changed RBCs number, increased pectin methyl esterase activity and up-regulated rcpmel expression in the maize roots. Volatile oil decreased maize RBCs survival rate to 70.20 % when treated with 5 mu l for 48 h. RBCs nuclei showed abnormalities (fragmentation, marginalization, malformation and dispersion) when treated with volatile oil, alpha-terpinene and cymene. Exposed to volatile oil, nuclear abnormalities rate > 70%, while other treatments were < 27%. There were more vacuoles, chromatin condensation and marginalization in RBCs treated with high doses of volatile oil. TUNEL assay showed death of RBCs was possibly due to programmed cell death or cell necrosis. Thus, the volatile oil, alpha-terpinene and cymene were cytotoxic and genotoxic to RBCs, caused nuclear abnormalities, decreased the RBC viability and induced programmed cell death and necrosis, thereby inhibited the growth of young maize roots. The allelopathic toxicity of oil on the RBCs was significantly greater than either alpha-terpinene or cymene individually.	[Wang, Y. N.; Hao, J. M.; Qian, R. H.; Ren, Q. R.; Ma, D.

It is shown that the spectral behavior of the far-zone scattered field is influenced by the structural function width of the dielectric susceptibility of the scattering medium. In particular, the structural function width of the dielectric susceptibility of the scattering medium plays an important role in the direction at which the spectral switch occurs. These results may have potential applications in areas such as the inverse scattering problem.

The adsorption structure of metronidazole on anatase TiO2(101) and (001) surfaces has been optimized under vacuum, water, acidic, and alkaline conditions, respectively. The optimum adsorption site, adsorption energy, and electronic structure of the stable adsorption model were calculated. The adsorption characteristics of metronidazole on two different surfaces of TiO2 were studied under acidic and alkaline conditions. Our calculated results found that the adsorption energy range is -0.95 -3.11eV on the TiO2 (101) surface, and the adsorption energy range is -0.84 -3.29eV on the TiO2 (001) surface. The adsorption wavelengths of electron transition between valence band and conduction band of metronidazole on the anatase TiO2(101) surface is in the range of visible wavelength, indicating that the TiO2(101) surface can effectively utilize visible light. However, the photocatalytic effect of the TiO2(001) surface is greatly affected by the environment. The results reveal the adsorption characteristics and the environmental influence for metronidazole on photocatalytic anatase TiO2 surfaces.

In the memtransistors, the gate voltages are capable of modulating not only the transport properties of the fabricated FET, but also the resistive switching (RS) behaviors of the memristor. Herein, we employ mechanically exfoliated 2D layered GaSe nanosheets to prepare GaSe based three-terminal memtransistors. By using Ag as the electrodes, the memristor exhibits non-volatile bipolar RS characteristics. More importantly, under exposure to air for one week, the RS behaviors are dramatically enhanced with the ON/OFF ratio reaching up to 5.3 x 10(5) and ultralow threshold electric field of similar to 3.3 x 10(2) V cm(-1). The ultralow threshold electric field of GaSe based memristor could be related to the low migration energy of the intrinsic Ga vacancy in p-type GaSe. Moreover, the GaSe-based memristor shows long-term retention (similar to 10(4) s) and high cycling endurance (similar to 5000 cycles) simultaneously. Hence, the fabricated three-terminal 2D GaSe memtransistors possess high performance with large switching ratios, ultralow threshold electric field, good endurance and long-term retention. Furthermore, the device demonstrates gate tunability in RS characteristics, suggesting the promising applications in multi-terminal electronic devices with low power consumption and complex functionalities, ranging from non-volatile memory, logic device to neuromorphic computing.

A fresh method for the fabrication of amine-modified CO2 solid adsorbents was proposed. Graphene oxide (GO) was modified by different concentrations of polyethylenimine (PEI) by a one-step method. The physical chemical structure and adsorption/desorption properties were characterized in detail. Results showed that the PEI-GO solid adsorbents were successfully fabricated and the particles were uniform, controllable and intact. The CO2 adsorption properties of PEI-GO solid adsorbents were measured, and the solid adsorbents exhibited good CO2 adsorption capacity (128.1mg/g) at 75 degrees C. In addition, the PEI-GO solid adsorbents were regenerable and exhibited good stability. Accordingly, this work stands out as a promising solution to a distinct way for the fabrication technology of CO2 solid adsorbents.

Structural designs of sliding transformer, copper secondary, and high temperature superconducting primary are presented. A single-pancake racetrack coil assembly wound by ReBCO tapes is used as the primary winding. 12-mm-width ReBCO tapes with 700 A class critical current are introduced to wind the ReBCO primary operated at 50 Hz. The relations among the transfer power, transfer efficiency, air-gap distance, primary current, secondary load and primary turn number are investigated to clarify the SWPT behaviors under different operating conditions. Benefited from high critical current and nearly zero loss of ReBCO primary and elimination of high-frequency power conversion devices, the sliding-type SWPT scheme could be well expected to combine the advantages of high power, high efficiency, and compact device structure.

Herein, goat hair, as a low-cost and eco-friendly precursor, is employed to fabricate cauliflower-like in-situ nitrogen, oxygen and phosphorus tri-doped porous biomass carbon (NOPC) by a facile activation with H3PO4 and carbonization process. The morphology and microstructure of NOPC can be readily tuned by altering pyrolysis temperature. The as-prepared NOPC matrix material carbonized at 600 degrees C possesses 3D hierarchical porous structure, high specific surface area (535.352 m(2) g(-1)), and appropriate pore size and pore size distribution. Encapsulating sulfur into the NOPC depends on a stem-melting technology as cathode materials of Li-S batteries. Due to the synergistic effect of special physical structure and inherent tri-doping of N, O and P, electrons and ions transfer and utilization of active sulfur in the materials are improved, and the shuttle behaviors of soluble lithium polysulfides are also mitigated. Consequently, the S/NOPC-600 composite exhibits excellent electrochemical performance, giving a high initial discharge capacity of 1185 mA h g(-1) at 0.05 C and maintaining a relatively considerable capacity of 489 mA h g(-1) at 0.2 C after 300 cycles. Our work shows that a promising candidate for cathode material of Li-S batteries can be synthesized using low-cost and renewable biomass materials by a facile process.

The finite element spaces which are made up of piecewise polynomials are easy to be constructed. Especially, the variational form considered in this work is based on two gradient operators. The stability, priori error estimates and L-2 error estimates for velocity are proved in this paper. In addition, we prove that the new method also yields globally divergence-free velocity approximations. The convergence rates are independent of the Reynolds number, thus the new WG finite element method is efficient for both the Stokes and Darcy equations dominated. Finally, numerical results illustrate the performance of the method and support the theoretical properties of the estimator. (C) 2018 IMACS. Published by Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The inductance submodel covers the estimations of self and mutual inductances among the single-pancake coils, double-pancake coils, and solenoidal magnets. The critical current submodel reveals the transient critical current characteristics such as the minimum critical current and initial quenching position inside one specific magnet. As a case study, numerical calculation and experimental verification of a small-scale ReBCO magnet are investigated. Being verified by both the simulations and experiments, the proposed SMES model can be expected to evaluate the energy storage property prior to practical magnet fabrication.

Transient ac loss of each ReBCO layer is modeled in this paper by using an electromagnetic-superconducting coupled finite-element-modeling (FEM) method. Temperature field distributions inside and around the whole ReBCO pancake coil caused by the distributed ac losses are further discussed to investigate the thermal operating characteristics under pulsed overcurrent conditions. For a ReBCO pancake coil having 20 coil turns,the maximum ac lass value locates in the sixth coil turn from inner wall to outer wall of the whole coil. By considering the solid-to-solid and solidto-fluid heat transfer behaviors, local overheated point having the highest operating temperature appears inside the middle and lower part of the sixth coil turn. A current-dependent power function for the highest temperature estimation is also concluded to depict the nonlinear relations between the operating temperatures and currents inside the ReBCO pancake coil. These electromagnetic superconducting thermal coupled characteristics lay some technical bases to design and evaluate proper overcurrent and overheating schemes for various ReBCO pancake coils and magnets.

Herein, a well-controlled hierarchical structured bimetallic electrocatalyst of Co3O4@Ni2P-CoP/NF is constructed via phosphating and carbonating Co3O4 nanowires template-directed fabrication Ni-substituted ZIF-67 arrays onto a 3D Ni foam substrate. The as-obtained hierarchical structured nano-material displays superior electrocatalytic performance with a small overpotential of 298 mV required to achieve the current density of 50 mAcm(-2) and reveals high electrocatalytic activity with long-term durability after continuously working for 40 h in 1.0 M KOH. The good performance of the material for OER can be attributed to the synergistic effect of optimized hierarchical structure, partial substitution of Ni for Co, high porosity and N, P-codoping.

In this study, a novel Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0 composite was synthesized and a strategy of Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0 composite combined with HCOOH under UV radiation as reducers for the nitrate reduction was established to improve the selective reduction of nitrate (NO3-) to nitrogen gas (N-2). The Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0 composite was synthesized by simple chemical replacement and O-2 oxidation process and characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD and XPS. The nitrate removal efficiency of 100% and the N-2 selectivity of 95.4% were achieved in Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0/HCOOH/UV system when the initial nitrate concentration was 50 mg N/L and the reduction time was 60 min. The nitrate reduction efficiency was low by the role of alone or combinations of Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0 composite, HCOOH or UV radiation. The quick reduction of nitrate to nitrite was due to the synergistic effect of electrons from the galvanic-type cell consisting of Fe-0 as anode and Cu-0 as cathode, photoelectrons from Cu2O under UV radiation and CO2 center dot- produced mainly via photochemical reaction between HCOOH and UV radiation. The subsequent conversion of nitrite to N-2 was caused by CO2 center dot-, which was responsible for the high efficient reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas in the Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0/HCOOH/UVsystem. Finally, the denitrification mechanism of the Cu2O-Cu-0@Fe-0/HCOOH/UV system was tentatively proposed.

Structural designs of rotating pot-core transformer, copper secondary, and high temperature superconducting primary are presented. A double-pancake coil assembly wound by ReBCO tapes is used as the primary winding, and this ReBCO primary is designed to operate at 50 Hz. The relations among the transfer power, transfer efficiency, air-gap distance, primary current, and secondary load are investigated to clarify the SWPT behaviors under different operating conditions. Benefitting from high critical current and nearly zero loss of ReBCO primary and elimination of high-frequency power conversion devices, the rotary-type SWPT scheme could be well expected to combine the advantages of high power, high efficiency, and compact device structure.

The performance indicators of underwater laser radar systems, including the double-pass scintillation index sigma(2)(I), the aperture averaging factor A, the mean signal-to-noise ratio < SNR > and the mean bit-error-rate < BER > of monostatic system (MS) and bistatic system (BS) in oceanic turbulence are investigated. On the other hand, the difference of beta(2)(0), sigma(2)(I) and < SNR > between EPSM and Nikishov's power spectrum model (NPSM) is also studied. It is found that, in weak and moderate turbulence, sigma(2)(I) is underestimated by NPSM when oceanic turbulence is dominated by the temperature fluctuations, while sigma(2)(I) is overestimated by NPSM when oceanic turbulence is dominated by the salinity fluctuations. However, it is inverse situation in strong turbulence. Furthermore, the behavior of < SNR > between EPSM and NPSM is different from that of sigma(2)(I). The relative difference of sigma(2)(I) and < SNR > between EPSM and NPSM is larger for MS than that for BS. The relative difference of sigma(2)(I) and < SNR > between EPSM and NPSM is larger in weak and moderate turbulence than that in strong turbulence.

It is shown from the distribution of the RSOCL that the diameter of each Gaussian profile lobe, the radial distance of all adjacent lobes, the number of the rings, the number of the lobe of each ring, and the radial distance of the array rings can be properly controlled by adjusting structural parameters of the scattering medium.

An achiral ferromagnetic/chiral antiferromagnetic bilayer system leading to controllable size and density of skyrmions	SCIENTIFIC REPORTS			English	Article							LATTICE; STABILITY; DYNAMICS; MOTION	Magnetic skyrmions are topologically protected domain structures related to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). To understand how magnetic skyrmions occur under different circumstances, we propose a model for skyrmion formation in a bilayer system of ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic (FM/AFM) films, in which the bulk DMI is only present in the AFM film. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that skyrmions are formed in this system due to the competition between the DMI and demagnetization energies. A critical interfacial exchange energy (A(i) = 6.5 mJ/m(2)) is determined, above which the competition occurs at its full extent. More skyrmions are formed with increasing external magnetic field till a critical value above which the external field is too large and thus leading to the annihilation of skyrmions. The spacing between two skyrmions can be as small as 45 nm. Our results may give technological implications for future skyrmion applications.	[Morvan, F. J.; Luo, H. B.; Yang, H. X.; Xia, W.

However, neither the quantification of their relative contributions nor the substrate dependence of the chemical effect have been well established. Moreover, there is to date no understanding of a possible coupling between both effects. Here we demonstrate how systematically engineered silver and gold planar and nanostructured substrates, covering a wide range of field enhancements, provide a way to determine relative contributions of chemical and electromagnetic field-enhancement in SERS measurements of benzenethiol. We find a chemical enhancement of 2 to 14 for different vibrational resonances when referencing against a vibrational mode that undergoes minimal CE. The values are independent of substrate type and independent of the enhancement of the electromagnetic intensity in the range from 1 to 10(6). This absence of correlation between chemical and electromagnetic enhancement resolves several long-standing controversies on substrate and intensity dependence of the chemical enhancement and allows for a more systematic design of SERS substrates with desired properties.

A hysteretic response between magnetic field and electric polarization was observed. It is found that LiFe5O8 exhibits ME coupling that becomes significant at 250 K and increases with decreasing temperature. In contrast to many other spinel oxides that were reported to exhibit a ME effect at very low temperatures (typically below 30 K), the bulk LiFe5O8 demonstrates a ME coefficient of 2 mV Oe(-1) cm(-1) at 120 K. This material exhibits the highest ME coupling temperature among the magnetoelectric spinel and related materials reported so far. This ME effect is attributed to the ordered arrangement of magnetic ions (Fe3+) which are located in a noncentrosymmetric coordination environment. Our result provides a new avenue to search for single-phase magnetoelectric materials with high coupling temperatures that could be used in potential technological applications.

BChE can catalyze the reaction of acetylthiocholine (ATCh) to produce thiocholine (TCH), which has a thio-ligand to combine with mercury ions (Hg2+) in T-Hg2+-T. The released single-stranded DNA can associate with N-methyl mesoporphyrin IX (NMM) and K+ to form a G-quadruplex, producing a strong fluorescence signal. Therefore, the concentration of the released probe DNA was proportional to the amount of BChE, enabling the conversion of the target reaction events into a detectable signal from the G-quadruplex-NMM. Parathion, as an inhibitor of BChE activity, can be used to prevent the generation of thiocholine and therefore leads to less or no release of free probe DNA. As a result, most of the probe DNA maintains its T-Hg2+-T hairpin structure in the reaction solution, which leads to a significant fluorescence signal decrease. Therefore, by using the "signal-off" mode, the simple and homogeneous fluorescence detection of OPs is readily achieved. Under optimal conditions, the detection limits of BChE and OPs are 0.15 ng mL(-1) and 0.025 ng mL(-1) respectively. Besides, BChE in serum samples has been detected with satisfactory results. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including being simple, cost-effective, highly sensitive and selective for label-free analysis.

The Association Between Posttraumatic Growth and Quality o Life Among Low-Grade Gliomas Patients in China	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						low-grade gliomas; quality of life; posttraumatic growth; coping strategy; posttraumatic stress symptoms	CANCER SURVIVORS; BREAST-CANCER; NECK-CANCER; DISORDER; ADJUSTMENT; MODEL; PTSD; LONG; HEAD	Background: Diagnosing with low-grade gliomas (LGGs) can be a very shocking and stressful experience, a traumatic event potentially leading to the development of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), and posttraumatic growth (PTG). Understanding how patients cognitively and behaviorally response to their diagnosing is also important to postoperative treatment. Thus, the current study explored the association between PTG and quality of life (QoL) of Chinese patients with LGGs. The moderation effects of coping strategies and PTSS on the relationship between PTG and QoL have been examined as well. Methods: Posttraumatic stress symptoms, Posttraumatic growth, coping strategies, and QoL were measured by using self-report surveys. Three hundred and thirty patients completed surveys approximately 1 month after surgery. We used three multiple regression models and added interaction terms in these models to test the moderation effects of PTSS and coping strategies on the relationship between PTG and QoL. Results: The results of hierarchical multiple regression suggested that PTG significantly predicted QoL, both PTSS and coping strategies moderated the association between PTG and QoL. Specifically, the association between PTG and QoL for patients who have non-significant PTSS is stronger than those who have significant PTSS. Furthermore, as the score of Avoidant Coping increases, the association between PTG and QoL becomes weaker. Conclusion: Posttraumatic growth may help to improve the QoL of LGGs patients, but PTSS and Avoidant Coping impeded the positive effect of PTG on QoL.

J	Chen, WM; Zhang, AP; Jiang, GB; Li, QB				Chen, Weiming; Zhang, Aiping; Jiang, Guobin; Li, Qibin			Transformation and degradation mechanism of landfill leachates in a combined process of SAARB and ozonation	WASTE MANAGEMENT			English	Article						Mature landfill leachate; Young landfill leachate; Semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter; Ozone; 3D-EEM-PARAFAC; UV-Vis	DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER; PHOTOCATALYTIC DEGRADATION; OXIDATION; NITROGEN; ELECTROLYSIS; REMOVAL; OZONE; ACID; PRETREATMENT; PARAMETERS	Dissolved organic matter (DOM) in mature landfill leachate is significantly different from that in young landfill leachate; the composition of DOM greatly influences both biological treatment and advanced treatment processes. In the present study, the transformation and degradation mechanisms of landfill leachates in a combined semi-aerobic aged refuse biofilter (SAARB) and ozonation process was investigated using organic removal analysis, molecular weight distribution (MWD), 3D-EEM-PARAFAC analysis, UV-Vis spectroscopy, and linear regression. Results revealed that the DOM in mature landfill leachate contained a greater amount of aromatic substances and had higher molecular weight than DOM in young landfill leachate. After the SAARB process, humus contained in the SAARB was discharged with effluent from both mature and young landfill leachate. Due to the differences in composition and structure of organic matter, the COD removal efficiency (17.89%) of SAARB effluent from treating mature landfill leachate (mature SAARB effluent) was much lower than that (45.91%) of SAARB effluent from treating young landfill leachate (young SAARB effluent) under the same operational parameters of the ozonation process. As indicated by PARAFAC analysis, better chemical stability of DOM in mature SAARB effluent resulted in inferior ozone treatment efficiency. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity and the concentration of benzene ring compounds in the mature and young SAARB effluent were reduced significantly by the ozonation process. Therefore, great improvements in the biodegradability of SAARB effluents were achieved in the ozonation process. Overall, the results of this study provide suggestions and guidance for practical applications of these technologies. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Adsorption structures of dimetridazole on anatase TiO2(1 0 1) and (0 0 1) crystal surfaces have been optimized under vacuum, water, acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. The optimum adsorption site, adsorption energy and the electronic structure of the stable adsorption model were calculated. By analyzing the optimal adsorption site, we found that the possibility of degradation of dimetridazole on the surface of TiO2 and reaction site of degradation were the opening ring of C-N bond on the imidazole ring. By comparing the adsorption characteristics of dimetridazole on two different crystal planes of TiO2 under acidic and alkaline conditions, we found that the adsorption wavelengths of electron transition between conduction bands and valence bands of dimetridazole on anatase TiO2(1 0 1) crystal plane are within the range of visible wavelength. The results show that TiO2(1 0 1) can effectively utilize visible light and catalyze the adsorption and degradation reaction of dimetridazole on TiO2(1 0 1) surface. Our results show that TiO2(1 0 1) crystal surface can effectively use visible light under acidic and alkaline conditions. Our conclusion can explain the experimental result that the use of visible light on TiO2(001) face is greatly affected by the environment.

It is proven that the ABCD law is valid if a new complex beam parameter is adopted, which presents a simple method to study the propagation of PCBs through an optical system in nonlinear media. In self-focusing media, the spatial coherence for the beam spreading case is better than that for the beam self-focusing case, when the propagation distance is longer than the inversion coherence distance. An optimal beam will necessarily involve a trade-off between collimation and spatial coherence when PCBs propagate in self-focusing media.

Above the critical point, the tetrahedral structure typical of liquid water at room temperature is substituted by chains of hydrogen-bonded molecules in supercritical water model. Moreover, urea does not cause long-term interference with the order of water, and methane can be dissolved in supercritical water due to the destruction of the hydrated shell. According to the study of diffusion, the viscosity of water decreases with increasing temperature and increases with increasing concentration. The reason for the difference in the diffusion rate between the two solutes is related to their relative molecular mass and hydrogen bonding. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Connectionist computational models are one of the most popular approaches for simulating those mapping problems; however, their lack of explanatory ability has prevented them from being further used to understand the language learning process. Therefore, the work of extracting rational rules from a connectionist model is as important as simulating the mapping behaviors. Unfortunately, there is no available technique that can be directly applied in those computational models to simulate nonclassification problems. In this paper, an autoencoder-based connectionist computational model is proposed to derive a rule extraction method that can construct "If-Then" rational relations with high fidelity for nonclassification mapping problems. To demonstrate its generalizability, this computational model is extended to a modified version to address a multi-label classification mapping problem related to cognitive style prediction. Experiments prove this computational model's simulation ability and its explanatory ability on nonclassification problems by comparing its fidelity performances with those of the classical connectionist computational model (multilayer perceptron artificial neural network), and its similar ability on a multi-label classification problem (Felder-Silverman learning style classification) by comparing its prediction accuracy with those of other rule induction techniques.

The in situ generation of H2O2 can not only improve the storage and transportation safety of H2O2 but also reduce the capital and operation costs. In the present work, a novel system, i.e., multi-walled carbon nanotube aluminum(MWCNT-Al) composite was used to in situ generate H2O2 through micro-electrolysis. The MWCNT-Al composite was characterized and optimized. The accumulation concentration of H2O2 reached 947 mg/L at the initial pH of 9.0, the MWCNT-Al composite dosage of 8 g/L and oxygen gas flow rate of 400 mL/min after 60 min. The in situ generation of H2O2 was achieved by MWCNT-Al/O-2 system, mainly owing to the direct contact between Al-0 and MWCNT in MWCNT-Al composite, which accelerated the transfer of electrons from Al-0 to O-2, as well as the excellent electrocatalytic activity of MWCNT toward the two-electron reduction of oxygen. When H2O2 in situ generation technology was used in peroxone process (O-3/H2O2 process) to degrade glyphosate in aqueous solution, the removal efficiency of TOC and total phosphorus was 68.35% and 73.27%, respectively. Finally, the possible mechanism of in situ generation of H2O2 in MWCNT-Al/O-2 system was temporarily proposed. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

The proposed method mainly determined the cognitive activity level of designers through link entropy, which was calculated on the basis of linkography. The proposed method also quantified the degrees of interaction and cooperation among designers from the cognitive activity relationship of the design team, which was constructed on the basis of linkography. An experiment based on design of transport service for thin-walled parts was conducted. Results showed that the proposed method can quantify a design cognition process, analyze cognitive features of designers effectively, and determine the compatibility among designers.

However, most of the optical absorbers are fabricated with high-cost sophisticated nanofabrication techniques, which limit their practical applications. Here, we introduce a cost-effective method to fabricate an optical absorber by using a simple evaporation technique. The absorbers are composed of evaporated nanoparticles above a silver (Ag) mirror separated by a silicon oxide layer. Experimental results show over 77% absorption in the wavelength range from 470 to 1000 nm for the absorber with isolated Ag nanoparticles on the top. The performance of the absorber is adjustable with the morphology and composition of the top-layer nanoparticles. When the top layer was hybrid silver-copper (Ag-Cu) nanoparticles (NPs), the absorption exceeding 90% of the range of 495-562 nm (bandwidth of 67 nm) was obtained. In addition, the bandwidth for over 90% absorption of the Ag-Cu NP absorber was broadened to about 500 nm (506-1000 nm) when it annealed at certain temperatures. Our work provides a simple way to make a highly efficient absorber of a large area for the visible light, and to transit absorption from a narrow band to broadband only by temperature treatment.

All ceramics exhibit perovskite structure and their densification is improved after the addition of LCT. The doping of small quantities of LCT (x0.015) results in the generation of two sorts of defect complexes [i.e., (Cu-Nb'''-V-o(center dot center dot) and (V-o(center dot center dot)-Cu-Nb''' - V-o(center dot center dot)], inducing greatly hardening electrical behaviors with high mechanical quality factor Q(m) of similar to 780 at x=0.015. However, excess LCT (x0.015) contributes to the substantial reduction of defect complexes, and thus the ceramics are softened, presenting a relatively low Q(m) of similar to 480 at x=0.03. It is noted that the ceramics with x=0.03 remain comparatively great piezoelectric performances: d(33)=96 pC/N and k(p)=37%. Our study indicates that the electrical properties of KNN-based ceramics doped with LCT are closely related with microscopic defect structure in the materials.

Here, nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbons (NHPC) was fabricated by KOH treatment and pyrolyzation using pig nail as a protein-rich biomass source, and microscopic characteristics of the materials were effectively tailored by optimizing activation temperature to enhance electrochemical performance of carbonaceous materials for supercapacitor. The results show that theoptimum activation temperature is 800 degrees C. The constructed NHPC-800 displays three-dimensional interconnected honeycomb structure, possesses high specific surface area (2563.30m(2)g(-1)) with high-speed ion transfer channels. Additionally, NHPC-800 deliver superior capacitance with 251.4Fg(-1) at 1Ag(-1).

The process primarily comprises an increase in the gas pressure from an unsaturated to a saturated status during gas injection followed by a reduction in the gas pressure due to the adsorption of CO2 after the cessation of gas injection. We developed a straightforward and effective calibration-based gas pressure model for the spatio-temporal prediction of CO2 in a coal matrix. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency of the models for predicting gas pressure is between 0.931 and 0.998. The results indicate that the spatio-temporal distribution of gas pressure in the coal matrix mainly relates to the gas pressure injected, geological boundary conditions, initial geo-stress, and gas type. The gas concentration tends to increase in high Earth stress and boundary areas during gas injection, whereas the gas adsorption rate is high in areas of low Earth stress. The gas adsorption rate of the coal matrix decreases as the gas injection content and gas injection time increase; improvement of the gas injection pressure can boost the gas adsorption to some extent. This model can explain or predict the behaviour of gas in a coal matrix depending on the matrix density, and it has the potential to simulate gas behaviour in a large-scale undisturbed coal sample considering the structure (joints and cleats) of the coal.

The access-based services are enabled by means of Smart Product-Service Systems (SPSSs) that integrate smart products and e-services into a single solution. However, there is a lack of studies that cover the acceptance factors for both smart products and e-services of SPSSs. Therefore, it is important to have a study to explore the factors that influence the acceptance of SPSSs. This study develops a conceptual framework which consists of the perceived interactivity of mobile apps and the particularity of the smart shared products as antecedents apart from perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, as suggested by the Technology Acceptance Model. To test the research framework empirically, a self-reported online survey was conducted among bike sharing program users in China. A total of 520 valid responses were collected, and the partial least-square structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique was used to examine the research model. The empirical results suggest that the perceived interactivity of mobile apps and the particularity of smart shared products are two significant sets of antecedents that influence consumers' perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness, and the perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are preconditions for the acceptance of SPSSs. The findings generate practical suggestions for SPSSs providers to increase the network size of users, improve the interactivity of mobile apps, and manage the distributions of service points.

In this study, a coagulation-ozonation process was developed to treat the concentrate arising from membrane treatment of landfill leachate. The effect of coagulant type and initial pH on treatment efficiencies was investigated. Results showed that many of organics were effectively removed in the coagulation process. Thereafter, ozone was applied to further treat the coagulation-resistant organic substances. Our results revealed that the degradation rate of these coagulation-resistant substances followed the trend (color number) CN > (light absorbance at 254 nm) UV254 > (chemical oxygen demand) COD, and the residual coagulation-resistant substances were oxidized rapidly in the ozone process. Ozone first destroyed the molecular structure of fulvic acid and the by-products generated, such as protein-like substances. In addition, the molecular weight, organic condensation degree, and concentration of benzene ring compounds were considerably decreased. Moreover, the macro molecular organics (i.e., humic acid and fulvic acid) within the size range 1-100 kDa were effectively degraded and partially transformed into bicarbonate. Overall, the combined coagulation-ozonation process reduced COD, UV254, and CN in the landfill leachate concentrate by 8832%, 94.37%, and 98.83%, respectively, and thus the biodegradability of the treated leachate also was significantly improved. This excellent performance proved the feasibility of the combined coagulation-ozonation process for the removal of recalcitrant organic substances contained in landfill leachate concentrate, benefiting subsequent biological treatment.

Three kinds of artificial leather materials (polyvinyl chloride artificial leather (PVC), polyurethane artificial leather (PU) and polyurethane/polyvinyl chloride artificial leather (PU/PVC)) have been investigated, and then seven analysis methods were introduced to identify the materials. Thermo-gravimetric analysis indicated the materials had fine thermal stability. Fire-proof testing revealed the artificial leather materials had good flame retardancy, which could improve the applicability of fire-proof building materials. Tearing examination results indicated that there was a clear distinction between PVC and PU. The PU displayed significant differences compared with PVC or PVC/PU through pH indicator to observe the color of the pyrolysis gas aqueous solution. The dissolution tests results showed that cyclohexanone, dichloromethane and dimethylformamide (DMF) were efficient solvents that could be used for identifying PVC, PU and PU/PVC. The ATR-FTIR, a way to provide the high discriminating ability for identifying artificial leathers, indicated that the artificial leathers had different infrared characteristic peaks. In addition, the main compositive materials of the artificial leathers could be inferred by the relative contents analysis of N and Cl in artificial leathers.

The introduction of a small amount of CuF2 (x <= 1.5) generates two kinds of defect complexes (i.e., (Cu-Nb''' - V-O(center dot) (center dot))' (DC1) and (V-O(center dot) (center dot) - Cu-Nb''' - V-O(center dot) (center dot))(center dot) (DC2)). However, with x further increasing to 3.0, both DC1 and DC2 defect complexes gradually disappear. This variation of defect complexes with the doping level of CuF2 is resulted from the competition effect of the dopings of Cu and F ions. As a result of the evolution of DC1 and DC2 induced by the co-doping of Cu and F ions, the ferroelectric and piezoelectric behaviors of the ceramics exhibit interesting V-shape evolutions: as x increases, the P-E loop becomes more pinched until it forms a double hysteresis loop at x = 1.5, while the double hysteresis loop gradually "opens" and becomes a normal slanted single one with x further increasing to 3.0; accordingly, the ceramics are gradually hardened with x increasing, showing an ultrahigh Q(m) (2708) and a low d(33) (91 pC/N) at x = 1.50, but softened with x further increasing, providing a relatively low Q(m) (349) and a high d(33) (140 pC/N) at x = 3.0.

J	Chen, R; Peng, DZ				Chen, Rui; Peng, Dezhong			Analysis and Improvement of a Mutual Authentication Scheme for Wireless Body Area Networks	JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SYSTEMS			English	Article						Wireless body area network (WBAN); Authentication scheme; Security; Anonymity	PROTOCOL	An increase in aging population and the consequent chronic diseases pose not only serious effects to the economy but also a heavy burden to the medical system. Wireless body area networks (WBANs) provide a simple and low-cost strategy for health monitoring and telemedicine of the elderly. Many authentication schemes based on WBAN have been presented to address the sensitivity and privacy of collected data and the open characteristic of wireless networks. Wu et al. recently presented an efficient anonymous authentication scheme for WBANs, in which a one-side bilinear pairing methodology was applied to reduce the burden on the WBAN client side. However, we demonstrate that their scheme suffers from client impersonation attacks and that the adversary can easily forge a legal client to access the network service. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of Wu et al.'s scheme and design a novel mutual authentication scheme for WBANs that adopt asymmetric bilinear pairing to enhance security. Results of security and performance analyses reveal that the new scheme offers more effective security, better performance, and higher efficiency than Wu et al.'s scheme. We also provide a formal security proof of the protocol by using BAN authentication logic.

Combining the compact difference operator in space discretization and the linear theta method in time, the compact theta scheme for the linear problem is first proposed. By virtue of the Fourier method, the suggested scheme is shown to be unconditionally stable and convergent in the discrete L-2-norm for any theta epsilon [1/2, 1]. And then this idea is generalized to the semi-linear case, the corresponding compact theta scheme is constructed and analyzed in detail. Numerical experiments corresponding to the linear and semi-linear situations are carried out to support our theoretical statements. (c) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The generated HCP-PPh3-Ru with a Ru loading of 5.0 wt% displays a high electrochemical performance for HER with an overpotential of 61 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm(-2). Moreover, HCP-PPh3-Ru with a Ru loading of 3.5 wt% exhibits the best catalytic activity for AB hydrolysis with a turnover frequency of 402 mol H-2 (mol(RU) min)(-1). The high catalytic property of the achieved catalyst is probably attributed to the substantial porosity and individual pore structure of support Furthermore, the P-functional groups in HCP-PPh3 can facilitate the anchoring of Ru functioning as coordination sites to stabilize the small Ru nanoparticles, thereby deduces the high catalytic activity. The present work provides a facile strategy for synthesizing efficient microporous organic polymer stabilized Ru catalyst for HER and aqueous AB decomposition.

To investigate the temporal dynamics of heavy metals in decomposing litter, we conducted a two-year field experiment using litterbag method across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Using multigroup comparisons of structural equation modeling with different litter mass loss intervals, we assessed the direct and indirect effects of several biotic and abiotic factors on the release rates of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). Results suggested that both the concentrations and amounts of Pb, Cd, and Cr increased during litter decomposition regardless of ecosystem type and litter species, showing an immobilization pattern. The release rates of Pb, Cd, or Cr shared a common hierarchy of drivers across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, with environmental factors and initial litter quality having both direct and indirect effects, and the effects of initial litter quality gained importance in the late decomposition stages. However, litter chemical dynamics and microbial diversity index have significant effects on release rates throughout the decomposition process. Our results are useful for better understanding heavy metal fluxes in aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, and for predicting anthropogenic heavy metal pollution impacts on ecosystems. In addition, our results indicated that not only spatial but also temporal variability should be taken into consideration when addressing heavy metal dynamics accompanying litter decomposition process.

Controllably and spontaneously evolved double emulsions from microfluidics are used as templates for continuous fabrication of the micromotors in one-step. The micromotors possess interconnected hierarchical porous structures with two well-aligned microscale pores incorporated in nanoporous matrix. The opening hole of one microscale pore at the bottom of micromotor is decorated with Fe3O4@Ag nanoparticles to decompose H2O2 for bubble-propelled motion. Due to their hydrophobic and magnetic hierarchical porous matrix, the micromotors can be used for capture of oil pollutants in water, and then easy recovery by using a magnetic field. Moreover, the micromotors can be flexibly functionalized by simply incorporating functional nanoparticles into the hierarchical porous structures for efficient water decontamination. This is demonstrated by modifying their hierarchical porous structures with thiol-modified SiO2 nanoparticles for efficient removal of heavy metal ions in water. These bubble-propelled hierarchical porous micromotors show great power as tools for efficient decontamination of polluted water. Moreover, the approach based on microfluidic emulsions is promising for continuous and controllable fabrication of novel micromotors with well-engineered structures and advanced functions.

However, ferromagnetic skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillators cannot reach high oscillation frequencies. In this work, we propose to use the circular motion of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion to create an oscillation signal in order to overcome this obstacle. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that the antiferromagnetic skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillators can produce high frequencies (tens of GHz). Furthermore, the speed of the circular motion for an antiferromagnetic skyrmion in a nanodisk is analytically derived, which agrees well with the results of numerical simulations. Our findings are useful for the understanding of the inertial dynamics of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion and the development of future skyrmion-based spin torque nano-oscillators.

A facile approach has been developed for synthesizing ultrafine and uniform Rh NPs deposited on carbon by using the small soluble organic molecule (SOM) of l-proline (PRO) as capping agent (Rh-PRO/C). The enrichment of N,O-coordination sites for the metal precursor by using PRO was found to be the key to the synthesis Rh-PRO/C. The as-prepared Rh-PRO/C showed high catalytic activity for ammonia borane methanolysis with the highest total turnover frequency (TOF) of 1035 mol(H2) (mol(Rh)min)(-1) under basic conditions, which was three times higher than that of the state-of-the-art Rh-based catalysts. The excellent catalytic performance of Rh-PRO/C was ascribed to the well-dispersed Rh NPs and the PRO-functionalized metal surface, which can provide more active sites for the reaction. The merit of size-controlled synthesis combined with metal NP surface modification by SOMs is likely to be beneficial in various catalytic fields.

The addition of Mn to the Na/Fe catalysts significantly improves the selectivity of light olefins and reduces the C5+ selectivity. The catalyst exhibiting optimal catalytic performance, 5Mn-Na/Fe, shows a CO2 conversion of 38.6% with high selectivity of light olefins (30.2%), high O/P ratio (7.5), and low selectivity of methane (11.8%) and CO (11.7%). XRD and Mossbauer spectra indicate that the addition of Mn to Na/Fe catalysts facilitates the formation of active Fe5C2 species. Besides, the strong interaction between the Mn promoter and Fe species is revealed by the Mossbauer spectra, XRD and XPS, which lowers the amount and strength of CO adsorption, and consequently contributes to the weakening of the chain-growth reaction leading to the high selectivity of light olefins. This work can provide guidance for catalyst design through the modulation of the ability of the chain-growth reaction to improve the catalytic performance in CO2 hydrogenation.

The as-prepared absorbents were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy. The equilibrium adsorption capacity was achieved in approximately 30 min. The adsorption process of CS-BT for Nd3+ was well fitted with a Freundlich model and the kinetics followed the pseudo-second-order rate equation. The maximum adsorption capacity for Nd3+ was 133.72 mg/g and dynamic adsorption characteristics of single ion (La3+, Ce3+, Nd3+) were investigated. The solution concentration was less than 30 mg/L when effluent volume was approximately 800 mL. Subsequently, the adsorbent column was desorbed by HNO3 solution. There was no significant loss of adsorption capacity after three cycles of regeneration, showing a satisfactory recyclability. Furthermore, CS-BT exhibited excellent dynamic adsorption performance of two mixed ions (La3+/Ce3+, La3+/Nd3+, Ce3+/Nd3+) and three mixed ions (La3+/Ce3+/Nd3+). The competitive adsorption capacity was La3+ < Ce3+ < Nd3+. The results indicate that the adsorption selectivity of column adsorption could provide a theoretical basis for the adsorption and separation of light rare earth ions. Therefore, this efficient adsorbent shows promising potential for the treatment of industrial wastewater.

The two titled compounds crystallize in the monoclinic space groups Cc (no. 9) and Pc (no. 7), respectively. In their crystal structures, [HgI4] tetrahedrons connect with each other via sharing corners into one-dimensional (1-D) [HgI3] chains, and then all the 1-D chains connect with [Rb(H2O)](+) complexes to form the three-dimensional (3-D) frameworks. The consistent packing style results in a strong macroscopic nonlinear optical effect due to the superimposition of the microscopic second-order susceptibilities of [HgI4] tetrahedra. Powder second-harmonic generation (SHG) measurements show that both alpha- and beta-RbHgI3 center dot H2O are phase-matchable (type I), and the measured SHG coefficients are about 15.0 and 14.0 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). Both the compounds exhibit wide transparency from near UV to mid and far-infrared region, suggesting that alpha- and beta-RbHgI3 center dot H2O are potential infrared NLO crystals. Band structure and optical property were also calculated by DFT methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this Letter, pump modulation by multiple constant bandwidths was proposed and demonstrated. The similar to 98.9 km sensing with similar to 5 m spatial resolution and no use of optical pulse coding (OPC) was achieved by similar to 8 dBm Brillouin pump, which is lower by similar to 9 dB in theory by comparison with exponentially increased bandwidth modulation. Compared with traditional DBA-BOTDA, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement with > 4.6 dB was obtained. The flattened standard deviation (STD) of Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) (less than similar to 2 MHz) along the whole fiber was demonstrated.

In the present study, we investigated the effects of a flooding gradient on the growth and carbohydrate reserves of Polygonum hydropiper plants originating from low- and high-elevation habitats in the Dongting Lake wetlands. The results indicated that shoot length did not differ, whereas the total biomass and carbohydrate reserves were reduced under flooded compared to well-drained conditions for plants originating from both habitat types. However, shoot length, shoot mass, rhizome mass, and total biomass were lower in plants from low-elevation habitats than in those from high-elevation habitats in the flooded condition. Soluble sugar and starch contents in belowground biomass were higher in plants from low-elevation habitats than in those from high-elevation habitats independently of the water level. Therefore, P. hydropiper plants from low-elevation habitats exhibit a lower growth rate and more conservative energy strategy to cope with flooding in comparison with plants from high-elevation habitats. Differential strategies to cope with flooding among P. hydropiper populations are most likely a response to the flooding pressures of the habitat of origin and may potentially drive ecotype differentiation within species along flooding gradients.

With the increasing amount of Na, both CO2 conversion and alkenes selectivity increase at low and moderate amounts and then plateau (with the highest to be 36.8% and 64.3%, respectively), while the corresponding methane production decreases to 7.2%. It is found that the addition of Na enhances the adsorption of CO2, facilitates the formation and stability of active species Fe5C2, and inhibits the secondary hydrogenation of alkenes. All these effects lead to the desirable catalytic performance. Besides, it is observed that the content of Fe5C2 is related to the amount of Na. This study can provide scientific guidance to the design and the synthesis of high-efficiency catalysts for CO2 hydrogenation to high-value chemicals.

By taking advantage of confinement effect of nanopores in 3D porous carbon and urea as nitrogen source, we developed a straightforward method for preparation of uniform Ru NCs and simultaneous nitriding of the carbon scaffolds (Ru/3DNPC). The resulting Ru/3DNPC-500 had a measured overpotential of 15 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) toward hydrogen evolution reaction as well as very high turnover frequency (584 mol of H-2 (mol of Ru min)(-1)) for hydrolytic decomposition of ammonia-borane, outperforming many previously reported Ru-based catalysts. Ru NCs confined in 3DNPC substrate can supply numerous catalytically active sites for the reactions, thereby leading to high catalytic activity. The present synthetic strategy could open a new direction for preparing metal NCs catalysts.

Iridium(III) complexes all display highly emissive behavior with photoluminescence quantum yields in the range of 0.45-0.66 and a maximum emission wavelength at similar to 563 nm. Hexagonal columnar mesophases of iridium(III) complexes can be obtained by changing the number and length of peripheral alkoxyl chains attached to a 2,5-diphenylpyridine ligand (main ligand) and a pyridyltetrazolate ligand (auxiliary ligand). Moreover, experimental results of the charge transport properties for these iridium(III) complexes, which were measured by the space charge limited-current method, exhibit ambipolar carrier mobility behavior. In particular, the liquid-crystalline iridium(III) complexes can self organize into one-dimensional (1D) nanostructure after thermal annealing treatment in their liquid-crystalline phase. The devices based on liquid crystal film display improved charge transport behavior compared with that of the devices based on polycrystalline film, indicating 1D nanostructure is beneficial to charge carrier injection and transportation.

However, inhibitors, such as acetic acid generated during lignocellulose pretreatment and hydrolysis, would significantly inhibit microbial fermentation efficiency. Microbial mutants able to tolerate high concentration of acetic acid are needed urgently to alleviate this inhibition.ResultsZymomonas mobilis mutants AQ8-1 and AC8-9 with enhanced tolerance against acetic acid were generated via a multiplex atmospheric and room temperature plasma (mARTP) mutagenesis. The growth and ethanol productivity of AQ8-1 and AC8-9 were both improved in the presence of 5.0-8.0g/L acetic acid. Ethanol yield reached 84% of theoretical value in the presence of 8.0g/L acetic acid (similar to pH 4.0). Furthermore, a mutant tolerant to pH 3.5, named PH1-29, was generated via the third round of ARTP mutagenesis. PH1-29 showed enhanced growth and ethanol production under both sterilized/unsterilized conditions at pH 4.0 or 3.5. Intracellular NAD levels revealed that mARTP mutants could modulate NADH/NAD(+) ratio to respond to acetic acid and low pH stresses. Moreover, genomic re-sequencing revealed that eleven single nucleic variations (SNVs) were likely related to acetic acid and low pH tolerance. Most SNVs were targeted in regions between genes ZMO0952 and ZMO0956, ZMO0152 and ZMO0153, and ZMO0373 and ZMO0374.ConclusionsThe multiplex mutagenesis strategy mARTP was efficient for enhancing the tolerance in Z. mobilis. The ARTP mutants generated in this study could serve as potential cellulosic ethanol producers.

The oxygen evolution reaction (OER), as a sluggish four-electron electrochemical reaction, has to overcome high overpotential to accomplish overall water splitting. Therefore, developing low-cost and highly active OER catalysts is the key for achieving efficient and economical water electrolysis. In this work, Fe-doped NiMoO4 was synthesized and evaluated as the OER catalyst in alkaline medium. Fe3+ doping helps to regulate the electronic structure of Ni centers in NiMoO4, which consequently promotes the catalytic activity of NiMoO4. The overpotential to reach a current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is 299 mV in 1 m KOH for the optimal Ni0.9Fe0.1MoO4, which is 65 mV lower than that for NiMoO4. Further, the catalyst also shows exceptional performance stability during a 2 h chronopotentiometry testing. Moreover, the real catalytically active center of Ni0.9Fe0.1MoO4 is also unraveled based on the ex situ characterizations. These results provide new alternatives for precious-metal-free catalysts for alkaline OER and also expand the Fe-doping-induced synergistic effect towards performance enhancement to new catalyst systems.

Hence, in order to select a proper green supplier, integration of the information entropy and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) under probabilistic uncertain linguistic sets (PULTSs) offered a novel integrated model, in which information entropy is used for deriving priority weights of each attribute and EDAS with PULTSs is employed to obtain the final ranking of green supplier. Furthermore, in order to show the applicability of the proposed method, it is validated by a case study for green supplier selection along with some comparative analysis. Thus, the advantage of this proposed method is that it is simple to understand and easy to compute. The proposed method can also contribute to the selection of suitable alternative successfully in other selection issues. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

In this method, the linguistic representation developed recently is converted into probabilistic linguistic information. For deriving the weight information of the attribute, an optimization model is built on the basis of the fundamental idea of grey relational analysis (GRA), by which the attribute weights can be decided. Then, the optimal alternative is chosen through calculating largest relative relational degree from the probabilistic linguistic positive ideal solution (PLPIS) which considers both the largest grey relational coefficient (GRC) from the PLPIS and the smallest GRC form probabilistic linguistic negative ideal solution (PLNIS). In the end, a case study concerning waste incineration plants location problem is given to demonstrate the merits of the developed methods. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by Atlantis Press SARL.

In this article, we consider an inverse eigenvalue problem that consists of the reconstruction of such a real non-selfadjoint matrix from its prescribed eigenvalues and those of two complementary principal submatrices. Necessary and sufficient conditions under which the problem has a solution are presented, and uniqueness is discussed. The reconstruction is performed by using a modified unsymmetric Lanczos algorithm, designed to solve the proposed inverse eigenvalue problem. Some illustrative numerical examples are given to test the efficiency and feasibility of our reconstruction algorithm.

J	Wang, WK; Chen, JC; Wu, YJ				Wang, Wenke; Chen, Jeng-Chung; Wu, Yenchun Jim			The Prediction of Freeway Traffic Conditions for Logistics Systems	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Discrete-time Markov chain; freeway traffic congestion; logistics management; short-term traffic prediction	SUPPLY CHAIN; COLLABORATION; MANAGEMENT; MODEL	With a steady increase in the number of vehicles predicted, traffic congestion has become a significant logistical challenge. The increase in traffic not only results in pollution and traffic congestion, but also leads to increased travel time and productivity loss. Thus, traffic prediction has become an important research topic in the academia. In fact, logistics managers are more concerned about predicting short-term traffic conditions than the accuracy of prediction. Therefore, this study used a discrete-time Markov chain and online traffic monitoring data to predict the probability of traffic congestion and identify the freeway bottlenecks. The findings of the study revealed the high probability of National Freeway 3's northern section being non-congested during the morning and afternoon rush hours. However, several bottlenecks were found in the links to nearby urban areas.

In our methods, on every iteration, we use only two projections onto some simple closed convex set C. Under the assumptions that the mapping in variational inequality problem is continuous(not necessary Lipschitz continuous) and monotone, we prove strong convergence theorems of the proposed algorithms.

Emotion plays a significant role in human decision making processes and on the behaviors during the evacuation. Moreover, grouping is a common phenomenon in crowds, and there are a lot of roles included in a group. In this paper, we present a unified framework to model the structure aspect of the groups with emotion for a crowd suffering fires and explosions in public areas. The proposed evacuation framework consists of two components: 1 an emotion model for various roles in the case of an emergency. Emotional changing is a complex process where different roles are influenced by different factors. 2 Both intra-group structure and inter-group relationship are considered to simulate the herd phenomenon in emergency. The structure and behaviors of a group are related to the emotions of different roles. A follower can decide whether to leave the group or not according to the emotion of the group leader and the one of his own, thus the members of the group may always dynamically change. Simulation results show that the developed framework can practically model the emotion changing and different group structures of evacuation crowds.

This paper presents experimental investigations into temperature and current dependent on-state resistance behaviors of state-of-the-art 1.2 kV SiC MOSFETs from various well-known semiconductor manufacturers. In view of engineering applications, two fitted double-exponential functions are introduced to visually depict the interactions among the on-state resistance, junction temperature and drain current instead of considering the combined effects of electron mobility and ionized dopant concentration inside cryogenic SiC MOSFETs. Optimal operating temperature and current ranges are subsequently extracted to characterize the cryogenic operation performance, and thus to explore some operating and designing guidelines of cryogenic SiC MOSFETs and SiC-based power conversions at 77 K.

As in the conventional linear algebra such a linear system may have none, exactly one or infinitely many solutions. When the number of solutions is exactly one, Cramer's rule is given as an analogue of the classical linear algebra. When the number of solutions is infinite, the existence of a minimal solution is shown and the formula of minimal solution is given. Furthermore, it is proved that every solution can be expressed as a linear combination of a respective minimal solution and some special vectors. Finally, an algorithm to describe all the solutions of a given max-algebraic linear equation system is proposed when its number of solutions is infinite.

Compared to heavy metal-contaminated soil without amendment, the application of natural palygorskite (PAL) or its modified form (KH550-PAL) significantly alleviated heavy metal toxicity to tomato. In addition, foliar malondialdehyde (MDA), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O-2(center dot-)) contents as well as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) reduced by 89, 28, 71, and 81%, respectively, in the modified palygorskite treatment than in the natural palygorskite treatment. Similar patterns were observed in heavy metals uptake of tomato. Foliar superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT) and glutathione reductase (GR) activities increased by 228, 196 and 238%, respectively, in the modified palygorskite treatment than in the natural palygorskite treatment. Thus, the application of the modified form (KH550-PAL) significantly ameliorated the oxidative stress via enhancing antioxidant defense and reducing thermal dissipation, which further improved photosynthetic electron transport of photosystem II and biomass accumulation of tomato. However, the dose of the modified palygorskite (KH550-PAL) was not enough to buffer negative effects of heavy metal toxicity to tomato growth in the experiment. It is suggested that the amendment dose should be used with great care in remediating contaminated soils with heavy metals. Thus, further experiments are needed by different rates of the modified palygorskite (KH550-PAL).

Firstly, we briefly review the definition of 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic sets (2TLNNSs) and introduce the score function, accuracy function and operational laws of 2TLNNs. Next, to fuse overall 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic evaluation information, we define some new aggregation operators of 2TLNNs based on Hamacher product and sum to propose 2TLNNHWA and 2TLNNHWG operators. Furthermore, combine traditional EDAS model with 2TLNNs information, the 2-tuple linguistic neutrosophic EDAS model is established and all computing steps are simply depicted. In our presented model; it's more accuracy and effective for considering the conflicting attributes. Finally, a numerical example for safety assessment of construction project has been given to illustrate this new model and some comparisons between 2TLNNs EDAS model and 2TLNNWA, 2TLNNWG, 2TLNNHWA, 2TLNNHWG aggregation operators are also conducted to further illustrate advantages of the new method.

Firstly, the definition, comparison and distance of IVIFNs are introduced, and the steps of the classical TODIM method for MADM problems are presented. Then, the extended classical TODIM method is proposed to deal with MADM problems with the IVIFNs, and its significant characteristic is that it can fully consider the decision makers' bounded rationality which is a real action in decision making.

The test helps to determine whether poor predictions (lack of fit) are significant, which would indicate that problems exist in the model. However, the goodness-of-fit test is usually performed at the end of data collection, which may not detect changes in the model's fit as data are generated sequentially. In this paper, we examined the potential for using a new online goodness-of-fit test to determine the goodness-of-fit at each time point and provide an early signal if significant changes occur during model fitting. The simulation results indicate that the proposed online chi-square test was more sensitive than the traditional goodness-of-fit tests and online Hosmer-Lemeshow test for studies that aim to monitor the adequacy of a fitted model. An example using real hospital data is then used to illustrate the applicability of the proposed test.

To our knowledge, few studies have been conducted to provide insights into the ecological implications on transportation or sharing of stress signals for clonal plants subjected to water stress. As a chemical elicitor, ABA can induce resistance response in plants suffering from water stress. A pot experiment was conducted to explore transportation or sharing of stress signals among interconnected ramets by using clonal fragments of Centella asiaticas (L.) Urban with four successive ramets (oldest, old, mature and young) subjected to low water availability (20% soil moisture contents). Compared with control, foliar oxidative stress of the old, mature and young ramets significantly decreased, and antioxidant capacity was increased when exogenous ABA was applied to the oldest ramets. Meanwhile, foliar PSII activity and chlorophyll content of the old, mature and young ramets significantly increased. Compared with control, biomass accumulation and ratio of below-ground/aboveground biomass of whole clonal fragments were significantly increased by ABA application to the oldest ramets. However, similar patterns were not observed when exogenous ABA was applied to the young ramets. Our results show that transportation or sharing of stress signals among interconnected ramets improves systemic resistance of clonal networks to water stress, which is dependent on directionality of vascular flows. Compared with the old or mature ramets, the young ramets displayed stronger resistance response (such as higher antioxidant enzymes activities and proline content, lower O-2(center dot-) production rate and malondialdehyde content) to water stress as well as higher PSII activity and chlorophyll content when exogenous ABA was applied to the oldest ramets. Thus, transportation or sharing of stress signals may favour young ramets that are most valuable for growth and fitness of clonal plant subjected to environmental stress. It is suggested that transportation or sharing of stress signals among interconnected ramets may confer clonal plants with considerable benefits in adapting to spatio-temporal heterogeneous habitats.

Firstly, we introduce the concept and basic operations of the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy sets, which is a new extension of Pythagorean fuzzy sets. Then, motivated by the idea of Bonferroni mean operators, we have developed some Bonferroni mean aggregation operators for aggregating dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy information. The prominent characteristic of these proposed operators are studied. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the dual hesitant Pythagorean fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems.

As the generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IFSs) and Pythagorean fuzzy sets (PFSs), the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (q-ROFSs) are more useful to express more fuzzy and ambiguous information. Meanwhile, to consider human's hesitance, the dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets (DHq-ROFSs) are presented which can be more valid of handling real MADM problems. To fuse the information in DHq-ROFSs more effectively, in this article, some Muirhead mean (MM) operators based on DHq-ROFSs environment, which consider any number of being fused arguments, are defined and studied. Evidently, the new proposed operators can obtain more exact results than other existing methods. In addition, some precious properties of these MM operators are discussed and all the special cases of them are investigated which indicates MM operator is more powerful than others. Afterward, the defined aggregation operators are used to solve the MADM with dual hesitant q-rung orthopair fuzzy numbers (DHq-ROFNs) and the MADM decision-making model is developed. In accordance of the defined operators and built model, two operators are applied to deal with the MADM problems for supplier selection with the DHPFNs information and the availability and superiority of the proposed operators are analyzed by comparing with some existing approaches. The method presented in this paper can effectually solve the MADM problems in which the decision-making information is expressed by the DHq-ROFNs and the attributes are interactive.

In this work, we study the complete chaos synchronization on time-dependent duplex networks in which interaction pattern among oscillators alternates periodically between two single-layer networks. The alternations between two layers are characterized by the offset strength A and the switching frequency . We find that there are two dynamical regimes depending on omega. For high omega, the critical A for the stable complete synchronization is independent of and the fast-switching approximation suggests that the time-dependent duplex networks can be approximated by the time-independent duplex networks with effective coupling strength. For low omega, the critical A depends on omega nonmonotonically.

In order to make rough sets deal with uncertain problems better, by considering the stringent notions of mathematical equality and inclusion, the definitions of rough equality and rough inclusion were introduced by Pawlak. But the researches of rough equality and rough inclusion are on a certain granularity space. In this paper, some change rules will be given with respect to the relations of rough equality and rough inclusion between two uncertain target sets in multi-granulation spaces, and the similarity degree between two roughly equal sets is proposed to describe the similarity of two uncertain sets in multi-granulation spaces. In order to describe two uncertain sets which are rough equality by an approximation set at the same time, the definitions of optimistic lambda-approximation set and pessimistic lambda-approximation set will be defined from the points of optimism and pessimism, and some properties of them are discussed in detail.

In-depth analysis of the effects of air anion ecological environment on the physiological index of outdoor sport population is proposed, through the construction of the dynamics of the parameters mathematical model with heart rate index in air anion ecological environment for outdoor sport population, such as VO2 index, OP index, proteoliposome index and pulse wave indicators and other physiological index. Through the MSComm control, the physiological parameters and air negative ion concentration index were integrated to construct the model of the influence of air anion ecological environment on the physiological indexes of outdoor sports population. The model was used to test the physiological indexes of outdoor sports population under a large number of air anion ecological environments. It is analyzed that the outdoor exercise in the air anion ecological environment has a significant improvement on the systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, ventilation volume, metabolic equivalent, immunoglobulin, testosterone, cortisol, hemoglobin and other indicators of the human heart. Long-term inhalation of air anion can promote the cardiovascular system function of the human body, and increase the body's FVC, FEC, VC, MVV to varying degrees, and promote the health of the respiratory system of athletes.

It affects the entire process of tunnel construction, operation and maintenance. In view of the complex disaster-causing mechanism and difficult quantitative predictions of water inrush, several theoretical methods are adopted to realize dynamic assessment of water inrush in the progressive process of tunnel construction. According to a survey conducted in the Zoumaling tunnel near Chongqing, China, 62% of its total length, e.g., 1525 m is associated with karst (including a fault fracture zone). On the basis of collecting real-time monitoring data about water inrush in the excavated section of the Zoumaling tunnel, a fuzzy data analysis method has been used to analyze the content of seven common ions in the inflow water, which makes it possible to classify the groundwater types and to establish the hydrogeological model of the tunnel site. In order to forecast the possibility and quantity of water inrush, it is essential to accurately model the groundwater system spatially. The preliminary forecasting result about untapped section reveals a small possibility of a sudden water inflow disaster and 35,000 m(3)/d water inflow, which is close to the ultimately measured quantity of water. This study provides a theoretical reference for the prediction of water inrush during tunnel construction, and the main characteristic of this study is reflected in the real-time prediction of tunnel water inrush according to actual tunnel inflow of excavated sections. This approach can be applied in similar situations for the prediction of tunnel water inrush in other karst regions.

In this work, the relationship of macroscopic and microscopic characteristics in CuO-doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 (KNN) ceramic has been studied by subjecting the material to electric field cycling, quenching, heating, and consequently aging. The introduction of CuO in KNN generates (Cu-Nb ''' - V-O(center dot center dot))(') and (V-O(center dot center dot) - Cu-Nb ''' - V-O(center dot center dot))('). The defect dipoles exhibit obviously the pinning effect on ferroelectric domains and thus induce a completely pinched/double P-E loop and excellent hardening piezoelectricity of high Q(m) of 2235. With the destruction of short-range symmetry uniformity between defect dipoles and ferroelectric dipoles induced by electric field cycling, quenching and heating, the ceramic can be depinned and softened. As a result, the depinned ceramic possesses an opened single ferroelectric hysteresis loop and the significantly decreasing Q(m). A distinctive aging is observed in the depinned ceramic. This study provides deep insights into the evolution of electrical properties of accepter-modified alkali niobate perovskite ceramics under electric field cycling, quenching, and heating.

These choices are invariably involved in life-changing outcomes regarding marriage, education, fertility, long-term well-being, and even public policy. Previous studies have clearly uncovered the neurobiological mechanism of the intertemporal decision in the schemes of regional location or sub-network. However, it still remains unclear how to characterize intertemporal behavior with multimodal whole-brain network metrics to date. Here, we combined diffusion tensor image and resting-state functional connectivity MRI technology, in conjunction with graph-theoretical analysis, to explore the link between topological properties of integrated structural and functional whole-brain networks and intertemporal decision-making. Graph-theoretical analysis illustrated that the participants with steep discounting rates exhibited the decreased global topological organizations including small-world and rich-club regimes in both functional and structural connectivity networks, and reflected the dreadful local topological dynamics in the modularity of functional connectome. Furthermore, in the cross-modalities configuration, the same relationship was predominantly observed for the coupling of structural-functional connectivity as well. Above topological metrics are commonly indicative of the communication pattern of simultaneous global and local parallel information processing, and it thus reshapes our accounts on intertemporal decision-making from functional regional/sub-network scheme to multimodal brain overall organization.

Of course, the precious merits of these defined operators are investigated.

The existing MF forensic methods, however, ignore how JPEG compression affects median filtered images, resulting in heavy performance degradation when detecting filtered images stored in the JPEG format. In this paper, we propose a new robust MF forensic method based on a modified convolutional neural network (CNN). First, relying on the analysis of the influence on median filtered images caused by JPEG compression, we effectively suppress the interference using image deblocking. Second, the fingerprints left by MF are highlighted via filtered residual fusion. These two functions are fulfilled with a deblocking layer and a fused filtered residual (FFR) layer. Finally, the output of the FFR layer becomes input when extracting multiple features for further classification using a tailor-made CNN. The extensive experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in both JPEG compressed and small-sized MF image detection.

It has been reported that chitosan coupling with the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin dramatically disrupted biofilms of several Gram-positive bacteria. This finding suggested the application of the covalent conjugate of antimicrobial natural polysaccharides and antibiotics on anti-infection therapy. However, the underlying molecular mechanism of the chitosan-streptomycin conjugate (CS-Strep) remains unclear and the poor water-solubility of the conjugate might restrict its applications for anti-infection therapy. In this study, we conjugated streptomycin with water-soluble chitosan oligosaccharides (COS). Unlike CS-Strep, the COS-streptomycin conjugate (COS-Strep) barely affected biofilms of tested Gram-positive bacteria. However, COS-Strep efficiently eradicated established biofilms of the Gram-negative pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This activity of COS-Strep was influenced by the degree of polymerization of chitosan oligosaccharide. The increased susceptibility of P. aeruginosa biofilms to antibiotics after conjugating might be related to the following: Suppression of the activation of MexX-MexY drug efflux pump system induced by streptomycin treatment; and down-regulation of the biosynthesis of biofilm exopolysaccharides. Thus, this work indicated that covalently linking antibiotics to chitosan oligosaccharides was a possible approach for the development of antimicrobial drugs against biofilm-related infections.

Moreover, the periodic partial Hamming correlation (PPHC) properties of employed LHZ-FHS sets usually act as evaluation criterions for the performances of QS-FHMA systems in practice. In this letter, a new class of LHZ-FHS sets is constructed via interleaving techniques. Furthermore, these new LHZ-FHS sets also possess optimal PPHC properties and parameters not included in the related literature.

To enhance the robustness of the hybrid transmission system against direct current short-circuit faults, resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters are applied, and the effectiveness of this approach is assessed. Related mathematical models are built, and the theoretical functions of the proposed approach are expounded. According to the transient simulations in MATLAB software, the results demonstrate that: (i) The superconducting fault current limiter at the voltage source converter station enables to very efficiently mitigate the fault transients, and owns an enhanced current-limiting ability for handling the short-line faults. (ii) The superconducting fault current limiter at the line commutated converter station is able to mildly limit the fault current and alleviate the voltage drop, and its working performance has a low sensitivity to the fault location. At the end of the study, a brief scheme design of the resistive-type superconducting fault current limiters is achieved. In conclusion, the application feasibility of the proposed approach is well confirmed.

Given this, this paper puts forward fuzzy permeability, which makes the model more in line with the seepage situation, and then improves the accuracy of the model. At the same time, the fuzzy function theory is studied deeply and systematically. On this basis, according to the seepage law and physical property of the oil and gas reservoir, the fuzzy seepage differential equation and the fuzzy boundary value condition of the reservoir are established. Then, the solution of the fuzzy seepage problem of the oil and gas reservoir is achieved. Compared with the traditional seepage model, the fuzzy seepage model can describe the flow in the reservoir more accurately. The definition of fuzzy permeability and the construction of fuzzy seepage equation provide a new method and a novel idea for studying the seepage of the reservoir.

Then, the temporal Caputo derivative is discreted by using L-1 approximation and the second-order spatial derivative is approximated by the centered finite difference scheme. The numerical solution can be obtained by an inverse exponential recovery method.

In the context of climate change, few studies have investigated resilience of social ecological system (SER) from the perspective of permafrost that restricts the hydrothermal condition of alpine grassland ecosystem. In this paper, based on the structural dynamics, we developed the numerical model for the SER in the permafrost regions of the source of Yangtze and Yellow Rivers, analyzed the spatial-temporal characteristics and sensitivity of the SER, and estimated the effect of permafrost change on the SER. The results indicate that: 1) the SER has an increasing trend, especially after 1997, which is the joint effect of precipitation, temperature, NPP and ecological conservation projects; 2) the SER shows the spatial feature of high in southeast and low in northwest, which is consistent with the variation trends of high southeast and low northwest for the precipitation, temperature and NPP, and low southeast and high northwest for the altitude; 3) the high sensitive regions of SER to the permafrost change have gradually transited from the island distribution to zonal and planar distribution since 1980, moreover, the sensitive degree has gradually reduced; relatively, the sensitivity has high value in the north and south, and low value in the south and east; 4) the thickness of permafrost active layer shows a highly negative correlation with the SER. The contribution rate of permafrost change to the SER is -4.3%, that is, once the thickness of permafrost active layer increases 1 unit, the SER would decrease 0.04 units.

Results show that the band gaps gradually decrease with the increase of the oxidation degree. We also study the lattice thermal conductivities of the three materials and find that the oxidation would greatly reduce the lattice thermal conductivity k of antimonene which is due to the decline of corresponding phonon lifetime. In addition, oxidation reduces the stiffness of antimonene. Our work provides a new perspective for the adjustment of thermal transport which will facilitate the design of thermal materials.

Results have shown that some optimal codes can be acquired if the defining sets are well chosen over finite fields. In this paper, we investigate the Lee-weight distribution of linear codes over the ring Fp+uFp (p is an odd prime) based on defining sets by employing exponential sums. We then determine the explicit complete weight enumerator for the images of these linear codes under the Gray map. A class of constant weight codes that meets the Griesmer bound for constructing optimal constant composition codes achieving the LVFC bound is also presented.

The obtained sulfur cathode demonstrates outstanding electrochemical performance, including a high reversible capacity (1321 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C), excellent rate capability (1030 and 753 mAh g(-1) at 1 and 3 C, respectively), and superior cycling stability (611 mAh g(-1) after 1000 cycles at 3 C). The enhancement in electrochemical performance can be ascribed to the unique core@shell architecture: the interconnected CNT-assembled dodecahedra core provides rapid Li+/e(-) transport and sufficient free space for volume change; the Ni (OH)(2) nanosheet shell not only acts as a durable physical barrier, but also serves as the polar material to restrain the dissolution of polysulfides with chemical interaction. In addition, in-situ nitrogen doping in CNTs introduces rich defects and active sites for polysulfides adsorption. This work provides a promising direction for high performance Li-S batteries by coating strong polar material on carbon materials.

In many previous works, the interaction and learning environments are assumed to be the same networks. However, in the real world, they might be different. In this work, we consider the spatial public goods game on two-layer networks, where the interaction and learning environments are represented by two asymmetric layers, respectively. We focus on the effects of edge overlap omega between the interaction and learning networks on the evolution of cooperation. The simulation results show that, the effects of omega on the evolution of cooperation depend on the synergy factor r. For relatively small r, higher overlap between the interaction and learning environments will be more favorable for cooperation. However, the situation is reverse for relatively large r, where the lower overlap between the interaction and learning environments results in higher level of cooperation. We also find that the asymmetry between the interaction and learning environments inhibits the coexistence of the cooperators and defectors. Furthermore, we show that the results of the model are robust to the underlying networks with different node degrees. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

The effect of different operational parameters, such as PS dose, initial pH, MW power, and the mass ratio of ferrous to PS [i.e., n(Fe2+/PS)], on chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal and the pseudo first-order constant k was systematically studied. Results showed that the constant k and COD removal increased considerably with increasing PS dose, MW power, and n(Fe2+/PS); however, the constant k and COD removal decreased proportionally as the initial pH increased from 3 to 11. A base-activated PS system was formed when the initial pH further increased to 13, which resulted in a dramatic increase of k and COD removal. Controlled experiments demonstrated that the synergetic effect of MW, Fe2+, and PS were significant. The value of k was 0.2425 min(-1), COD removal was 71.42%, and biodegradability remarkably increased from 0.056 to 0.6712 during treatment by MW-Fe2+/PS at a PS dose of 8 g/L, MW power of 600 W, initial pH of 3, n(Fe2+/PS) of 0.04, and reaction time of 14 min. Spectral analyses showed that the chromophores (including the diazo group and nitro group compounds) and benzene rings were greatly decomposed. Identification tests for reactive oxygen species showed that the predominant oxidizing species in the MW-Fe2+/PS process was the sulfate radical, and that the hydroxyl radical played a lesser role for color number elimination. From the perspective of both treatment efficiency energy consumption, the MW-Fe2+/PS process was confirmed to be an economical and promising pretreatment process for DDNP industrial wastewater.

This is due to its ability to represent signals and images using a limited number of significant coefficients without noticeable loss of visual clarity. The classical one-dimensional discrete cosine transform (1D - DCT) and two-dimensional discrete cosine transform (2D - DCT) have computational complexities of O(Nlog(2)N) and O(N(2)log(2)N), respectively. Thus, as the images grow in size, the runtime of the DCT highly increases which could limit its usability in real-time applications. This paper presents a quantum DCT algorithm (QDCT) that is more efficient than its classical counterpart in terms of complexity. Furthermore, the proposed QDCT is used to develop and realize a quantum image compression technique. The developed compression technique performs a search to determine the most significant computed DCT coefficients and is derived from Grover's algorithm. It provides a generalization to the original search algorithm by utilizing two oracle operators to solve the complex unstructured search problem rather than a single one. Thus, the proposed QDCT algorithm can simultaneously calculate the DCT coefficients and identify the significant DCT coefficients through applying two oracles. The comparison of the introduced QDCT with Grover's algorithm also indicates that the QDCT algorithm is more efficient. This can be attributed to performing a rotation on the subspace rather than on the global space in Grover's algorithm. In addition, the presented quantum 1D - and 2D - DCT have reduced complexities compared to the classical algorithms which are O(root N) and O(N), respectively. Therefore, the presented QDCT and compression algorithm can be applied efficiently to accomplish various transform-based quantum signal and image processing tasks. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc.

A pilot-scale, bi-layer bioretention system with biochar and zero-valent iron for enhanced nitrate removal from stormwater	WATER RESEARCH			English	Article						Tracer test; Internal water storage; Water retention; Nitrate removal; Redox potential	NUTRIENT REMOVAL; SUBMERGED ZONE; WATER; RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; RETENTION; QUALITY; EVENT; SOIL	Nitrogen (N) removal in conventional bioretention systems is highly variable owing to the low nitrate (NOS3-) elimination efficiency. We hypothesized that amending bioretention cells with biochar and zero-valent iron (ZVI) could improve the NO removal performance. A well-instrumented, bi-layer pilot-scale bioretention cell was developed to test the hypothesis by investigating its hydrologic performance and NO removal efficacy as affected by biochar and ZVI amendments. The cell containing 18% (v/v) wood biochar in the vadose zone and 10% (v/v) ZVI in the saturation zone was monitored for 18 months of field infiltration tests using synthetic stormwater amended with bromide (tracer) and NOS3-. Compared to the Control cell without amendments, the Biochar/ZVI cell increased water retention by 11-27% and mean residence time by 0.7-3.8 h. The vadose zone of the Biochar/ZVI cell removed 30.6-95.7% (0.6-12.7 g) of NO3-N from the influent, as compared with -6.1-89.6% (-0.1-2.9 g) by that of the Control cell. While the performance varied with synthetic storm events and seasons, in all cases the Biochar/ZVI cell resulted in greater NO removal than the Control cell. This improvement was presumably due to biochar's ability to improve water retention, facilitate anoxic conditions, increase residence time, and provide electrons for microbial denitrification. The saturation zone with ZVI amendment further promoted NO removal: removal was 1.8 times greater relative to the control in the first infiltration test, but was minimal in following tests. The reduction in performance of the ZVI amendment in subsequent tests might be due to diminished NO3-N input to the saturation zone after treatment by the biochar-amended vadose zone. The redox potential and dissolved oxygen content at the vadose/saturation zone interface also indicated more favorable denitrification conditions in the Biochar/ZVI cell. Biochar amendment demonstrated significant promise for increasing nitrate removal in bioretention systems. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

The models developed are of a similar form as the Black-Scholes model for pricing conventional European call options. However, unlike the Black-Scholes' model, the payoff conditions of the current models are determined by a PDE system. An upwind finite difference scheme is used for solving the models. Numerical experiments have been performed using two examples of pricing project expansion options in the mining industry to demonstrate that our models are able to produce financially meaningful numerical results for the two non-trivial test problems.

All of the title compounds are stoichiometrically equivalent materials which share a common structural motif composed of a distorted SO4 tetrahedron and an asymmetric SbF3 polyhedron. However, the macroscopic centricities of these four compounds are significantly influenced by the size and coordination environment of cations; Na2SO4SbF3 crystallizes in centrosymmetric space groups Cmca and (NH4)(2)SO4SbF3 in Pbca, while K2SO4SbF3 and Rb2SO4SbF3 crystallizes in noncentrosymmetric space group P2(1)2(1)2(1). Complete characterization including thermal analyses, infrared and UV-vis spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations is also reported. Powder second harmonic generation measurement for noncentrosymmetric K2SO4SbF3 and Rb2SO4SbF3 indicated that both of them are type I phase-matchable.

A Meta-Analysis of Two Decades Research of the Association Between Self-Regulation and Academic Performance	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Review						self-regulated learning; academic achievement; elementary and secondary education; cross-sectional studies; meta-analysis	RANDOM-EFFECTS MODELS; LEARNING-STRATEGIES; CHILDRENS SELF; MOTIVATION; MATHEMATICS; ACHIEVEMENT; PERCEPTIONS; AGE	Background: Self-regulated learning refers to the monitoring and controlling of one's own cognitive performance before, during, and after a learning episode. Previous literature suggested that self-regulated learning had a significant relationship with academic achievement, but not all self-regulated learning strategies exerted the same influences. Using an invalid strategy may waste the limited psychological resources, which will cause the ego depletion effect. The present meta-analysis study intended to search for the best self-regulated learning strategies and inefficient strategies for Chinese students in elementary and secondary school, and analyzed the critical phases of self-regulated learning according to Zimmerman's theory. The moderating effects of gender, grade, and publication year were also analyzed. Methods: Empirical studies which conducted in real teaching situations of elementary and secondary education were systematically searched using Chinese academic databases. Studies focused on undergraduate students, students of special education, or online learning environments were excluded. Fifty-five cross-sectional studies and four intervention studies (which generated 264 independent samples) were included with a total sample size of 23,497 participants. Random effects model was chosen in the current meta-analysis, and publication bias was also examined. Results: The results indicated that the overall effect size of self-regulated learning on academic achievement was small for primary and secondary school students in China. The effect sizes of self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were relatively higher than other strategies. Self-regulated learning strategies have the largest effect size on science disciplines (including mathematics and physics). Performance phase and self-reflection phase are key phases of self-regulated learning. From 1998 to 2016, the effect size between self-regulated learning and academic achievement was gradually decreasing. Conclusions: The main findings of the current study showed that self-efficacy, task strategies, and self-evaluation were key self-regulated learning strategies for Chinese students. Performance phase and self-reflection phase played significant roles in the process of self-regulated learning. Future studies need to include more intervention studies with rigorous treatment fidelity control and provide more empirical evidence from online learning, so as to compare the different effects of self-regulated learning between traditional education and online education.

The phase change of Fe-0 before and after reaction and its catalytic mechanism were investigated using multiple analytical techniques. Results showed that the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, UV254 and color number were 58.70%, 85.69% and 88.30%, respectively, at initial pH of 2.0, Fe-0 dosage of 0.5 g/L, H2O2 dosage of 20 mL/L, MW power of 400 W and reaction time of 14 min. Comparison of different Fenton-like processes indicated that the MW-Fe-0/H2O2 Fenton-like process was the most efficient and significantly decreased the aromaticity degree, molecular weight and condensation degree of organic substances in the leachate. The fluorescence peak of concentrated leachate exhibited a blue-shift in the MW-Fe-0/H2O2 process, further indicating that the condensation degree of humic substances declined and molecular weight remarkably decreased. The mechanism exhibited an advanced oxidation effect of a heterogeneous Fenton reaction between iron oxide and H2O2, as well as of adsorption and precipitation effects of iron-based colloids, on organic substances. Moreover, thermal and non-thermal effects of MW accelerated these reactions, achieving fast removal of organic pollutants in the concentrated landfill leachate. Overall, the results of this study showe that the MW-Fe-0/H2O2 process is an effective and promising method to handle concentrated landfill leachate.

Three different slopes was investigated to evaluate the effectiveness of OSSS for restoration, including a natural slope (NS), a cut slope without any artificial recovery treatment (CSW) and a cut slope treated with OSSS (CSO). The recovery of cut slopes was determined by evaluating a number of factors, including indices associated with plants on the slopes, soil enzyme activities (urease and sucrase), and soil nutrient content (soil organic matter (SOM), total phosphorous (TP), total potassium (TK), available nitrogen (AN), available phosphorous (AP), available potassium (AK), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca2+), magnesium (Mg2+), and sulphate (SO42-)). The results indicated that the vegetation and soil conditions differed between the three slopes. The Shannon-Wiener index (H), the Simpson index (D), and the Margalef index (R) values from the CSO and NS were lower than those of the CSW, whilst the Pielou index (E) value and vegetation canopy cover were higher for the CSO and NS than for the CSW. The content of SOM and AN in soil from the CSO was lower than in soil from the NS and CSW, and content of many nutrients were higher in soil from the CSO than in soil from the NS and CSW. This suggests that the restoration of vegetation and soil nutrients on the CSO was relatively successful. Our results indicated that the use of OSSS to restore cut slopes is effective in plateau areas. However, despite improvements in soil nutrient levels, there were still nutritional imbalances. Therefore, more attention should be paid to balancing nutrients in the later stage of OSSS implementation for the recovery of cut slopes at high altitudes.

The equilibrium structural lattice constants are in good agreement with reported data. The elastic characteristics were evaluated under high-pressure condition (0-20 GPa), such as the elastic constants, bulk modulus, shear modulus, Poisson's ratio, Zener anisotropy and compressibility index. Combining with quasi-harmonic Debye model, the thermal properties were confirmed at different temperatures (0-1200 K) and pressures (0-20 GPa), including the heat capacity, thermal expansion, Debye temperature, entropy, and Gruneisen parameter. Based on the semi-empirical relation, the hardness of materials was determined at various temperatures and pressures. Finally, the phonon spectrum curves and vibration frequencies of phonon were evaluated to confirm the thermodynamic stability of ZnSnX2. The Raman scattering spectrum and infrared absorption spectrum were simulated for chalcopyrite ZnSnX2.

The resulting Rh/NPC catalyst had a measured turnover frequency of 473.5 min(-1), higher than that of many previously reported Rh-based catalysts. This catalyst could also be reused eight times. The large surface area and abundant nitrogen-functional species of NPCs facilitate dispersion of Rh nanoparticles on their surface, providing numerous catalytically active sites for ammonia borane hydrolysis, thereby leading to high catalytic activity. This study demonstrates that NPC support can be used to prepare highly active catalysts. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Amer. Math. Soc. 26 (1970) 561-566, Theorem 6] that a domain R is a Prufer domain if and only if every divisible R-module is absolutely pure, where an R-module A is called absolutely pure if Ext(R)(1) (N, A) = 0 for every finitely presented R-module N. In this paper, we extend this result to Prufer v-multiplication domains (PvMDs). To do this, comparing with ]An Introduction to Homological Algebra, 2nd edn. (Springer, Science+Business Media, LLC, New York, 2009), Theorem 3.69], we firstly give homological characterizations of w-purity, and we introduce the concept of absolutely w-pure modules over commutative rings with zero divisors.

However, the insulating property of sulfur and severe polysulfides shuttle effect tremendously hinder their practical applications. Herein, a N, P dual-doped 3D hierarchical porous hybrid carbon is successfully prepared for advanced Li-S batteries based on the combination of reduced graphene oxide (rGO) and goat hair derived biomass carbon (rGO/GPC) by a simple one-pot pyrolysis process. A proper amount of rGO (3%) decorated biomass carbon (rGO/GPC-2) possesses a N, P dualdoped 3D robust porous framework and good electrical conductivity, which can effectively improve the sulfur utilization and immobilize the polysulfides through both physical restriction and chemical adsorption. The as-fabricated rGO/GPC-2-S composite used as Li-S batteries cathode delivers a high initial capacity of 1420 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and maintains a reversible capacity of 503mAh g(-1) after 500 cycles at 1.0 C with an ultralow capacity decay of 0.070% per cycle and excellent rate performance with 500 mAh g(-1 )at 2.0 C. The enhanced electrochemical performance is attributed to the positive synergistic effect of N, P-dual doped polar porous structure and nonpolar highly conductive hybrid carbon matrix.

Herein, a reproducible biomass-derived porous carbon with efficient ion-accessible surface and high content of heteroatoms has been successfully prepared by a simple high-temperature pyrolysis process. The facile chemical activation enables the as-synthesized materials own a hierarchical porous structure with an ideal pore size distribution and high contents of nitrogen (0.99 at%) and oxygen (8.99 at%), which is conducive to the high-efficiency transfer of electrolyte ions and enhancement in electrical conductivity of the materials. The as-fabricated hierarchical porous carbon materials deliver excellent specific capacitance of 287.1 F g(-1) at 1 A g(-1) and admirable cycling durability of 99.0% at current density of 1 A g(-1) after 10,000 cycles in 6.0 M KOH electrolyte. Remarkably, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor exhibits an excellent energy density of 43.0 Wh kg(-1) at power density of 875.0 W kg(-1) in ionic liquid electrolyte. This study shows that low cost porous carbon materials derived from biomass source by a facile pyrolysis might be a great option to fabricate high performance energy conversion device.

The correlations between the crystal structure, luminescent properties and surface morphologies with the chemical composition of the as-fabricated Ca2-1.5xEux(MoO4)(2) crystals have been investigated in detail. The results show that the Ca2-1.5xEux(MoO4)(2) (0 <= x <= 1.3) phosphors possess tetragonal phase, whereas the obtained Cat(2-1.5x)Eu(x)(MoO4)(2)(x = 4/3) (i.e. Eu-2(MoO4)(3)) phosphor exhibits monoclinic phase. The morphologies of crystals change gradually from quasi sphericity to tetragonal bipyramid owing to the preferential growth along taxis induced by Eu3+ ions. The photoluminescence spectra reveal that the intensities of the characteristic emission and excitation peaks initially increase and then decrease with increasing x, given the maximum at x = 1/3. Our results indicate that the difference in the charge, electronegativity, as well as ionic radius between Ca2+ ions and Eu3+ ions lead to the variation of crystal symmetry, crystal phase, surface morphologies and luminescence of the final Ca2-1.5xEux(MoO4)(2) crystals.

In the proposed method, with 0.1% (m/v) KBH4 used as a reductant, inorganic mercury was measured by using the non-ultraviolet radiation mode. However, under the ultraviolet atomization, the volatile MeHg+ hydride (MeHgH) generated by KBH4 can be transformed to elemental mercury vapor, and total Hg (MeHg and Hg2+) was detected in this UV atomization mode. Under the optimized experimental conditions, the limits of detection (LODs) were found to be 0.015 and 0.081 mg L-1 for Hg2+ and MeHg. And the relative standard deviations (RSDs) (n = 11) were 2.4% and 0.4%, respectively.

The vegetation cover can effectively resist soil erosion, improve soil quality and facilitate the ecological restoration of cut slopes. However, researchers have different views on what kind of vegetation cover is best to improve artificial soil quality and enhance the structural stability of cut slopes. To evaluate the effect of different vegetation restoration types on the artificial soil of cut slopes restored with OSSS, various soil samples were obtained from four treatments [herbaceous-only vegetation restoration slopes (HS); mixed vegetation restoration type slope I, composed of herbs and shrubs (MSI); mixed vegetation restoration type slope II, composed of herbs, shrubs and trees (MSII); and natural slopes (NS)]. Three slopes were selected for HS, MSI, MSII and NS, respectively, for a total of twelve slopes. The soil properties measured included some fundamental parameters (physical, chemical and biological parameters) and structural characteristics (bias coefficients, peak convex coefficient, fractal dimension, structural failure rate and soil erodibility). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ascending and descending functions were used to determine an integrated soil quality index (SQI). The results showed that there are significant differences in fundamental parameters, structural characteristics and the SQI between HS and other treatments, while the same properties, except SQI, were not significantly different between MSI and MSII. These findings imply that the HS is not suitable for long-term restoration on cut slopes, whereas MSII is a better vegetation construction model for the ecological restoration of cut slopes. However, there is still a huge disparity in these soil properties between the cut slopes and NS; this difference is attributable to the NS having a soil optimization process with long-term no human interference. Therefore, more effective management measures should be implemented to promote the ecological restoration of cut slopes.

To study the effect of thermal annealing on the scratch behavior of Polylactide (PLA), a series of scratch tests were conducted on multilayer assembled PLAs, which had been annealed for different time. It was found that greatly delayed critical damage including groove formation and ploughing was achieved, accompanied with obviously suppressed surface cracking and deformation following the increase of annealing time. The structural evolution during the annealing process was further investigated for better construction of structure-property relationship, which implied that the higher crystallinity and tensile strength originating from the perfection of crystalline morphology, played a significant role in restraining the surface deformation and cracking during the scratch process.

However, many existing human activity recognition approaches lack the capability of automatically learning these configurations from sequences of joints in four-dimensional space (spatio and temporal). In this paper, the authors propose an automatic joint configuration learning method, based on dictionary learning and sparse representation. The proposed method achieves the following features: 1) it automatically learns dynamic spatio-temporal geometric configurations of body joints, involved in activities, in a simple way; 2) it dispenses with the hand crafted feature designing process and provides a new method to organize joint coordinate data as fixed length column vectors, which are suitable for dictionary learning; 3) it replaces the conventional bag of words model with sparse coding method; words in learned dictionary capture subactivity features, and the frequencies of different words appearing in different activities characterize the categories of global activity; 4) it is robust to time misalignment and can classify any length of video sequence (online classification) in real time; 5) it is easy to combine this method with other forms of data for better performance, because of its data driven nature and flexible framework. The proposed method is tested with three state-of-the-art public human activity recognition datasets and the results are found to be better than those of CAD-60 dataset, and comparable to those of both MSR Action 3D and MSR Daily Activity datasets (source codes are publicly available at https://github.co/jinqijinqi/ SparseCodingDictionaryLearningHumanActivityRecognition).

Both theoretical and numerical aspects related to this problem were not discussed by Chaudhry and Templeton in their monograph (1983). Our analysis is based on the roots of the so-called characteristic equation of the Laplace-Stieltjes transform (LST) of the sojourn time distribution. Using the method of partial fractions and residue theorem, we obtain a closed-form expression of sojourn time distribution, from which we can calculate the value of the distribution function for any given time t [0, + ). Finally, to ensure the reliability of the analytical procedure, employing the work done by Gross and Harris (1985), an effective way to validate the correctness of our results along with some numerical examples are also provided.

It is demonstrated that the normalized CIF in a scattered field can be decomposed into two mutually independent parts: one is governed by the polarization property of the incident field, called the polarization-induced CIF change; the other is governed by the structural characteristics of the scattering medium, which is called the scattering-induced CIF change. Two special particulate media-i.e. random-distributed particles collection and deterministic-distributed particles collection-were discussed to show the changes of the normalized CIF in the scattered field.

Pure K0.5Na0.5NbO3 exhibits a well-saturated single P-E loop, giving low Q(m) of 72. Fe2O3-doped ceramic exhibits the combined effects of dominant donor and slight acceptor, giving a slightly slanted single P-E loop and relatively low Q(m) of 156. For MnO2-doped ceramic, moderate hardening properties with a slightly pinched P-E loop and relatively high Q(m), of 370 are exhibited. Unlike Fe2O3 and MnO2-doped ceramics, a double P-E loop and superhigh Q(m) of 1965 are obtained in CuO-doped ceramic. The defect structure and corresponding microscopic mechanisms in the ceramics have been systematically investigated. Our study shows that defect characteristics should be responsible for distinct hardening properties in Fe, Mn and Cu doped K0.5Na0.5NbO3 materials.

In the frame of density function theory, we used Ultrasoft pseudo-potentials and generalized gradient approximation method in our calculations. The optimized structural parameters are well consistent with available experimental and theoretical data. The enthalpy calculations show the first-order structural phase transitions (from chalcopyrite to rock-salt) happen at 46.8 GPa, 44.2 GPa, and 32.5 GPa for ZnSiP2, ZnGeP2 and ZnSnP2, respectively, along with the volume collapsing and bond length decreasing. The calculations of pressure-effects on band structures, electronic properties and bonding natures show the energy gaps decrease with increased pressure and disappear at the transition pressures. This effect is related to the evolution of bonding from the mixture of covalent-ionic to mainly ionic character in the chalcopyrite and rock-salt phases, respectively. The elastic parameters are discussed in detail under pressure conditions, such as elastic constants C-ij, bulk modulus B, shear modulus G, Young's modulus E, Poisson ratio v and Zener anisotropy factor A. Our results indicate the tetragonal chalcopyrite is easier to be compressed than to be sheared and structural anisotropy becomes obvious under hydrostatic pressure condition. It directly leads to micro-cracks and produces mechanical variations in crystal structure, resulting in the occurrence of structure transition. Finally, we obtained the Debye temperature for chalcopyrite ZnXP2 at ambient condition.

The antimicrobial capacities of skin secretions against the 60 representative environmental bacterial strains were evaluated using the values of the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) equivalents, which were defined as the volumes of antimicrobial solution just inhibiting the tested bacteria per 1 cm(2) of surface area, from 0.06 to 9.10 mL/cm(2). Our results revealed significantly different skin antimicrobial capacities among the three populations: Mianning < Huili < Kunming. Within the frog population, the skin antimicrobial capacities are highly variable depending on the season: in Mianning frogs, summer < autumn and spring; in Huili frogs, spring < autumn < summer; in Kunming frogs, autumn < spring < summer. The animal density and body mass significantly impacted the skin antimicrobial capacity, while the sex ratio and soil or water bacterial counts did not.

However, classical rough set-based methods consider only categorical data; furthermore, neighborhood rough sets adhere to numeric and heterogeneous data, but their outlier detection is mainly restricted to numeric data now. According to the hybrid data-driving, this paper investigates outlier detection by the neighborhood information entropy and its developmental measures, and the applicable data sets widely concern categorical, numeric, and mixed data; as a result, the new method extends both the traditional distance-based and rough set-based methods to enrich outlier detection. Concretely, the neighborhood information system is first determined by the heterogeneous distance and self-adapting radius, the neighborhood information entropy is then defined to implement whole uncertainty measurement, three gradual information measures are further constructed to describe each single object, and finally the neighborhood entropy-based outlier factor (NEOF) is integratedly established to detect outliers; moreover, the NEOF-based outlier detection algorithm (called the NIEOD algorithm) is designed and applied. By virtue of UCI data experiments, the NIEOD algorithm is compared with six existing detection algorithms (including the NED, IE, SEQ FindCBLOF, DIS, KNN algorithms), and the concrete results generally reflect the better effectiveness and adaptability of the new method.

Three cryogenic operating behaviors of on-state resistances and breakdown voltages of five types of commercial power MOSFETs and on-state voltage across their built- in reverse diodes are tested from 300 K to 77 K. The measured on-state resistances obtained in low-current tests show almost double-exponential functional relations with the operating temperatures, while the other two cryogenic parameters are directly or inversely proportional to the operating temperatures. Moreover, cryogenic on-state resistance behaviors in high-current tests from 20 A to 90 A are also found to have double-exponential functional relations with the operating currents. Based on the experimental results and their fitted temperature-dependent and current-dependent functions, integrated evaluation of overall energy efficiency involved with refrigerating cost is presented to form a feasible design guideline for cryogenic power conversions. Finally, two 40-kW and 4-MW boost choppers are conceptually designed and discussed to verify the proposed design guideline for the use in various MOSFET-based cryogenic power conversions.

We list the possible nonmagnetic topological semimetals and develop their k . p Hamiltonian in all layer groups with multiple screw axes in the absence of spin-orbital coupling. We find a cat's-cradle-like topological semimetal phase which looks like multiple hourglasslike band structures staggered together. Furthermore, we propose monolayer borophene and borophane with the pmmn layer group as the first material class to realize such a semimetal phase. A pair of tilted anisotropic Dirac cones at the Fermi level is revealed in two-dimensional boron-based materials, and the low-energy effective models are given. Moreover, akin to a three-dimensional Weyl semimetal, the topological property of these cat's-cradle-like Dirac semimetals can be verified by the calculation of a quantized Berry phase and the demonstration of a flat Fermi-arc edge state connecting two Dirac points as well. Our finding that borophene and borophane are cat's-cradle-like Dirac semimetals is of great interest for experiment and possible applications in the future.

Relations Between Older Adults' Implicit and Explicit Aging Attitudes and Self-Esteem	FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY			English	Article						implicit attitude toward one's own aging; explicit attitude toward one's own aging; implicit self-esteem; explicit self-esteem; older adults	ASSOCIATION TEST; STEREOTYPE ACTIVATION; MEMORY PERFORMANCE; AGE STEREOTYPES; LIFE-SPAN; BEHAVIOR; ANXIETY; PEOPLE; TRAJECTORIES; METAANALYSIS	Attitudes toward one's own aging and self-esteem are crucial variables in predicting older adults' physical and mental health and can significantly affect their will to live, cognitive judgement and acceptance of medical treatment. However, little is known about the relation between the implicit attitude toward one's own aging and implicit self-esteem. This research explored consistencies between implicit and explicit attitudes toward one's own aging and between implicit and explicit self-esteem and explored their relations in 70 older adults aged 60-91 years old using the word and picture versions of the Implicit Association Test and standardized scales. The results showed that (a) the explicit and implicit attitudes toward one's own aging represented independent structures, and the implicit and explicit self-esteem also represented independent structures; (b) subjects generally showed positive explicit attitudes toward their own aging and negative implicit attitudes toward their own aging while also showing high explicit self-esteem and relatively low implicit self-esteem; (c) subjects' implicit attitudes toward their own aging and implicit self-esteem were positively correlated, and explicit attitudes toward their own aging and explicit self-esteem were also positively correlated. The more positive the subjects' explicit attitudes toward their own aging, the higher their explicit self-esteem levels were. The more negative their implicit attitudes toward their own aging, the higher their implicit self-esteem levels were. We concluded that older adults' explicit and implicit attitudes toward their own aging and self-esteem are independent structures; older adults' explicit and implicit attitudes toward their own aging have predictive effects on their explicit and implicit self-esteem in different directions, respectively.

Exploring new candidates for further improving the performances of nickel-based catalysts and understanding the structure-activity relationship are still necessary to reduce the overpotential of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) thus advancing their application in electrochemical water splitting. Herein, we developed a facile two-step self-templated strategy for fabricating a three-dimensional (3D) nanoporous nickel/vanadium oxide (Ni/V2O3) nanoplate assembly as a new efficient catalyst for alkaline HER. It is found that by controllably annealing the Ni-V-O assembly as a single precursor, Ni and V2O3 components are uniformly integrated in the nanoporous composite, showing a synergistically enhancing effect on the HER. The resulting 3D nanoporous structure not only creates numerous active sites accessible for the HER but also provides a conductive open network towards efficient electron/mass transport. Consequently, the nanoporous Ni/V2O3 nanoplate assembly exhibits excellent catalytic performance for alkaline HER in terms of a low overpotential of 61 mV at 10 mA cm(-2) and a small Tafel slope of 79.7 mV dec(-1) together with excellent long-term durability. These findings provide new insights into good design and construction of other highly active catalysts for diverse applications.

Until now, all previous studies on the light propagation through oceanic turbulence were based on the Nikishov's power spectrum model. However, the eddy diffusivity of temperature and eddy diffusivity of salt are different from each other in most of underwater environments. Very recently, Elamassie et al. established a more reasonable power spectrum model of underwater turbulent fluctuations as an explicit function of eddy diffusivity ratio. The characteristic parameters such as the spatial coherence length of optical wave in turbulent medium play an important role in characterizing the strength of turbulence, the phase correction techniques in light propagation, etc. In the present paper, based on the Elamassie's power spectrum model of oceanic turbulence, the analytical formulae of the wave structure function, the spatial coherence length of optical wave and the Fried parameter in oceanic turbulence are derived, and the correctness of each of these formulae is verified. It is shown numerically that the results obtained by using the Elamassie's power spectrum model are quite different from those obtained by using the Nikishov's power spectrum model. If the Nikishov's power spectrum model is adopted, the strength of turbulence is underestimated when oceanic turbulence is dominated by the temperature fluctuations, while the strength of turbulence is overestimated when oceanic turbulence is dominated by the salinity fluctuations. If the Elamassie's power spectrum model is adopted, it is shown that the Kolmogorov five-thirds power law of the wave structure function is also valid for oceanic turbulence in the inertial range, and 2.1 times the spatial coherence length of optical wave is the Fried parameter, which are in agreement with those in atmospheric turbulence. In addition, based on the Elamassie's power spectrum model, the semi-analytical formula of the short-term beam spreading of Gaussian beams is derived in this paper, and its correctness is also verified. It is shown that the difference in short-term beam spreading is very large, whether the stable stratification of seawater is assumed or not. The results obtained in this paper are very useful for applications in optical communication, imaging and sensing systems involving turbulent underwater channels.

This study incorporates a nonlinear autoregressive neural network with exogenous inputs (NARX) into a decomposition based forecasting framework to propose a weighted recombination model for one-step ahead forward predictions. This proposed model is based on the assumption that as the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) model derives different components from the given data series, it makes different contributions to the final prediction results. A weight function is therefore introduced to determine suitable weights for each individual prediction result derived from the decomposed components and the corresponding NARX model. Finally, a new weighted decomposition based forecasting model is developed that is combined with the NARX model and the weight function. To justify and compare the effectiveness of the new proposed model, two non-linear, non-stationary data series are applied as the data resource for numerical experiments and 12 commonly used non-decomposition or decomposition based prediction models are selected as benchmarks, from which it is demonstrated that compared with the 12 models, the proposed new model noticeably improves forecasting accuracy.

Understanding P dynamics during litter decomposition in forested aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems will be of great importance for better understanding nutrient cycling across forest landscape. However, despite massive studies addressing litter decomposition have been carried out, generalizations across aqua tic and terrestrial ecosystems regarding the temporal dynamics of P loss during litter decomposition remain elusive. We conducted a two-year field experiment using litterbag method in both aquatic (streams and riparian zones) and terrestrial (forest floors) ecosystems in an alpine forest on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. By using multigroup comparisons of structural equation modeling (SEM) method with different litter mass-loss intervals, we explicitly assessed the direct and indirect effects of several biotic and abiotic drivers on P loss across different decomposition stages. The results suggested that (1) P concentration in decomposing litter showed similar patterns of early increase and later decrease across different species and ecosystems types; (2) P loss shared a common hierarchy of drivers across different ecosystems types, with litter chemical dynamics mainly having direct effects but environment and initial litter quality having both direct and indirect effects; (3) when assessing at the temporal scale, the effects of initial litter quality appeared to increase in late decomposition stages, while litter chemical dynamics showed consistent significant effects almost in all decomposition stages across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems; (4) microbial diversity showed significant effects on P loss, but its effects were lower compared with other drivers. Our results highlight the importance of including spatiotemporal variations and indicate the possibility of integrating aquatic and terrestrial decomposition into a common framework for future construction of models that account for the temporal dynamics of P in decomposing litter.

The ecological and evolutionary significance of transgenerational plasticity in plant has been studied mainly in the context of sexual generations. A pot experiment using the stoloniferous herb Centella asiatica was conducted to investigate the effects of high/low light treatment experienced by parental ramets (F-0 generation) on morphological and physiological properties of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) as well as growth performance. Light environment experienced by parental ramets (F-0 generation) significantly influenced petiole length, specific petiole length, internode length of stolon, leaf area, specific leaf area (SLA), leaf nitrogen and chlorophyll contents, potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) in offspring ramets subjected to parental or non-parental environments even after they were detached from the parental ramets. Potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) from parental ramets (F-0 generation) subjected to low light treatment was significantly greater than that of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) from parental ramets (F-0 generation) subjected to high light treatment. Potential maximum net photosynthetic rate (P-max) of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) subjected to parental light environment was greater than that of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) subjected to non-parental light environment. The greatest biomass accumulation and total stolon length were observed in offspring ramets (F-2 generation) subjected to low light treatment as parental ramets (F-0 generation) experienced. When parental ramets (F-0 generation) were subjected to low light treatment, biomass accumulation and total stolon length of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) experiencing parental light environment were significantly greater than those of offspring ramets (F-2 generation) experiencing non-parental light environment. Opposite pattern was observed in offspring ramets (F-2 generation) from parental ramets subjected to high light treatment. Our work provides evidence that transgenerational plasticity through both morphological and physiological flexibility was triggered across vegetative generations for stoloniferous herb C. asiatica subjected to high/low light treatment. The transgenerational plasticity can allow offspring ramets to present adaptive phenotype early without lag time in response to the current environment. Thus, it is very important for clonal plants in adapting temporally and spatially heterogeneous habitats.

Here, we present a systematical method to construct the effective lattice model of mirror symmetry protected three-dimensional multiple nodal line semimetals, when the spin-orbit interaction is ignored. For systems with a given pair of perpendicular nodal rings, we obtain all the effective lattice models and 11 inequivalent nodal line Fermi surfaces together with their related constraints. By means of first-principles calculations, we first propose a family of real materials, the beta phase of ternary nitrides X2GeN2 (X = Ca, Sr, Ba), that support one kind of these Fermi surfaces. Therefore, our work deepens the understanding of the nodal line structures and promotes the experimental progress of topological nodal line semimetals.

In this paper, a series of composites, named as PVA(n)-CMC(m)-GA, were prepared by filling the carboxymethyl cellulose sodium (CMC) into chemical cross linked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA). These composites demonstrated both water induced shape memory and self-healing effect. CMC with water sensitivity help the composite absorbing water to decrease the T-g of composite to cause shape recovery. And CMC with water solubility is also a good healing agent, which can freely move across the cutting cross-section in wet condition and form hydrogen bonds with PVA chains in dry condition to achieve healing. Water can affect the hydrogen bonding interactions between CMC and PVA, and which play a key role in the water-stimuli responsive properties. This study provides a relatively simple and low cost way to obtain water-induced multifunction materials.

In this paper, we propose an effective method to solve this problem. For an outdoor image in any time, the road segmentation can be separated into two stages. Firstly, a supervised generative network is trained to map the outdoor images in any time to the images with rich information. Secondly, a semantic segmentation network outputs a binary segmentation result. Our main contributions include: (1) firstly implementing road segmentation for all-day outdoor robot navigation with a low cost; (2) constructing a supervised generative network for domain mapping and (3) building a dataset for road segmentation for the outdoor images in any time. Our method is evaluated on three datasets. The results indicate that our method achieves a comparable performance with the state-of-the-art approaches. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In order to achieve nanosized SMNCs and prevent metal nanoparticles (NPs) from aggregation, the traditional liquid syntheses commonly require organic capping agents and low metal loading, which are unfavorable for practical production of SMNCs. Herein, a green and facile solid-state approach is reported for a general synthesis of Rh, Ru, and Ir NPs highly dispersed on different carbon supports via a room-temperature mortar grinding. The synthesis is easy to scale up and no organic solvent is needed. Metal NPs are free of capping agents and in a couple of nanometers with a uniform size distribution. Benefiting from the above features and high intrinsic activity, Rh NP/C shows the superior activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in terms of an ultralow overpotential of 7 mV at 10 mA cm(-2), outperforming the state-of-the-art HER electrocatalysts. The cell voltage to output a stable current density of 10 mA cm(-2) is only 1.53 V for the electrolyzer with Rh NP/C cathode. These results indicate that the present scalable solid-state synthetic strategy paves a new avenue for mass production of highly efficient SMNCs for diverse applications.

Recent researches indicate that the phonon scattering effect emerging on the nano-grain boundaries or the interfaces in composites can lead to remarkably improved ZT value. Inspired by such methodology to design effective interfacial phonon scattering, we have succeed in fabricating a novel thermoelectric composites based on conducting bismuth telluride and insulating calcium silicate (Bi2Te3)-CaSiO3) via constructing multiple interfaces. It is found that a low thermal conductivity is achieved coupling with high electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient through adjusting the synergetic effects between Bi2Te3 and CaSiO3 interfaces. A high ZT value (0.72) is obtained at relatively high temperature of 373 K for the composites with 85 wt% Bi2Te3, which is much higher than that of the bulk Bi2Te3 (similar to 0.59). Accordingly, since only materials of industrial grade were adopted, this work would also provide solid evidence for industrial fabrication of Bi2Te3 based TE materials toward low cost, high performance and large scale commodities.

We demonstrate the idea using a long-period 1D moire pattern of graphene on hBN by first-principles calculation. Through calculating the Berry curvature and topological charge of the electronic structure associated with various local graphene/hBN stackings in the moire pattern, it is revealed that the helical channel arrays originate intrinsically from the periodic modulation of the local topological orders by the moire pattern. For a freestanding wavelike moire pattern, two groups of helical channel arrays are spatially separated out of plane, validating the structural robustness of the moire topology. The generality and experimental feasibility of moire valleytronics are demonstrated by investigating a broad range of moire systems.

This study aimed to clone complement component C7 and analyze the different expression of C7 mRNA in fish fed during either the day or at night and then challenged with Aeromonas hyebvphila infection. The Pv-C7 cDNA of Pelteobagrus vachellii contained 2 647 bp with an open reading frame encoding a protein of 818 amino acids. Multiple sequences analysis indicated that Pv-C7 included eight domains, which was similar to results for other species. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that Pv-C7 was mainly expressed in the liver, spleen, intestine and head kidney tissues of healthy P. vachellii. Quantitative PCR analysis showed that C7 mRNA transcript in the liver, spleen and head kidney also increased significantly when the fish were fed at nighttime (20:00). In addition, the expression of Pv-C7 mRNA significantly increased with A. hydrophila challenge in the liver (48-96 h), spleen and head kidney (12-96 h) tissues of P. vachellii. Pv-C7 mRNA expression of the fish fed at nighttime showed significant higher than that in the fish fed at day time at 12-48 h in head kidney and 12-24 h in spleen. This study indicates that altering the feeding time from daytime to nighttime could increase Pv-C7 mRNA expression, and feeding time may affect the immune response involving C7.

J	Wang, JL; Zhuang, ST; Liu, Y				Wang, Jianlong; Zhuang, Shuting; Liu, Yong			Metal hexacyanoferrates-based adsorbents for cesium removal	COORDINATION CHEMISTRY REVIEWS			English	Review						Metal hexacyanoferrates; Cesium; Adsorption; Adsorbent; Separation	POTASSIUM COPPER HEXACYANOFERRATE; PRUSSIAN BLUE; ION-EXCHANGE; AQUEOUS-SOLUTION; MAGNETIC NANOPARTICLES; RADIOACTIVE CESIUM; HIGHLY EFFICIENT; CS+ ADSORPTION; CHITOSAN BEADS; HEAVY-METALS	Metal hexacyanoferrates (MHCFs), as typical coordination polymers, are efficient adsorbents for the monovalent cesium ion, which is a major product of uranium fission and the most commonly existing radionuclide in radioactive wastewater. Due to the comparable sizes between their structure lattices and hydrated cesium ions, MHCFs can selectively adsorb cesium ions with a background of other coexisting ions by ion-exchange. The main drawback is associated with its microcrystalline structure, that leads to weak mechanical strength and high flow resistance. Modification is necessary to make it capable for large scale application. This review is mainly focused on MHCF-based adsorbents for the highly efficient removal of cesium ions. The physicochemical structure together with its pros and cons as adsorbents for cesium removal are discussed along with proposed modification methods, including size control, immobilization and magnetic modification. Among these methods, immobilization by various kinds of organic (e.g., alginate, chitosan, fibers and PAN) and inorganic supporters (e.g., silica and glass) by embedding or in-situ synthetic methods are highlighted. The adsorption mechanisms and regeneration methods are also discussed, and some suggestions are given for future research. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The influences of Li+ ion concentration on the morphology, crystal structure, grain size, and upconversion emission of the microcrystals are deeply investigated. It is found that the substitution concentration of Li+ not only causes the phase transition but also induces variation in morphology and size. When the substitution concentration of Li+ ions is lower (x <= 0.3), the obtained Na(1-x)LixReF4 microcrystals possess hexagonal structure and exhibit hexagonal prism in morphology. Whereas at the higher substitution concentration of Li+ ions (x >= 0.6), the crystalline phase of the final Na(1-x)LixReF4 microcrystals transformed into tetragonal structure and their morphology changed into octahedron except for the sample Na(1_x)LixReF, with x = 0.9. Predictably, the obtained Na(1-x)LixReF4 microcrystals at the moderate substitution concentration of Li+ ions (x = 0.4 and 0.5) own the coexistent phases of hexagonal and tetragonal and display the obvious symbiotic morphologies of hexagonal prism and octahedron. All the samples showed characteristic emission peaks in green and red region with center wavelengths at 522 nm, 542 nm, and 652 nm respectively, and their upconversion intensities initially lift and then drop with the increasing x, giving the maximum at x = 0.5. Specifically, for the codoped Na0.5Li0.5ReF4 microcrystal, its UC intensity of the strongest green emission at 542 nm is about 18 times and 73 times greater than that of the codoped NaReF4 and LiReF4 microcrystals, respectively. Moreover, the variation amplitude of intensity for the green emission bands is much greater than that of the red emission with the increasing x. It could obtain a superior host matrix for upconversion luminescence by means of the formation of Na(1,)LixReF, solid solution at the feasible substitution concentration of Li+ (0.2 < x <= 0.6).

This paper presented a screening method for two major phenolic antioxidants (butylated hydroxytoluene and tert-butylhydroquinone) added in edible oils. To specifically visualize the targeted compounds after developing with toluene/ethyl acetate/methanol 8:1:1 (v/v/v) to 70mm solvent front, the plate was subjected to a standardized 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl assay. In addition to synoptical eye inspection, accurate quantification was realized by modified densitometric measurements: fluorescence mode, excitation wavelength 530nm (D-2 and W lamp) without optical filter, which offered satisfactory sensitivity (8.5-17.5mg/kg) and acceptable linearity (R-2>0.999 within 50-200ng/zone). Moreover, the established method was validated with edible oil samples, against EU Directive 2006/52/EC. Apart from that, the unambiguous confirmation of positive results was conveniently achieved by TLC-MS interface-mediated mass spectrometry. Featuring the merits of screening conception, the proposed method not only reached the goal of accurate quantification and conclusive identification of multi-phenolic antioxidants, but also excellently balanced the simplicity, detectability, and throughput of the screening workup. Therefore, it might be an attractive alternative to conventional methods.

A series of NaGd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) (0x0.5) multicolor tunable phosphors were prepared via a conventional solid-state reaction method. The as-prepared samples were well characterized by x-ray diffraction patterns, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscope, electron energy-dispersive spectroscopy, UV-vis diffused reflectance, photoluminescent spectra, decay curve and temperature-dependent photoluminescence spectra. The results indicate that the NaGd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) (0x0.5) phosphors exhibit a good crystallinity and form a continuous solid solution with scheelite structure. Under UV excitation, NaGd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) (0x0.5) phosphors exhibit characteristic emissions of Tb3+ ((D4FJ)-D-5-F-7, J=6, 5, 4, 3) and Eu3+ ((D0FJ)-D-5-F-7, J=0, 1, 2, 3, 4). The host NaGd(MoO4)(2) has excellent energy transfer efficiency for rare earth ions, and the energy transfer from Tb3+ ions to Eu3+ ions is efficient, which can be confirmed by the decay curve. The energy transfer (ET) process between Tb3+ and Eu3+ was demonstrated to a reasonable type via a dipole-dipole interaction with ET efficiency of about nearly 95%. Moreover, the temperature-dependent luminescence properties indicated that the phosphors possessed good thermal stability. Interestingly, the luminescence color of NaGd0.5Tb0.5-xEux(MoO4)(2) phosphors can be easily tuned from green to green-yellow, yellow, orange-yellow and ultimately to red by simply adjusting the related concentrations of Tb3+ and Eu3+ under a single wavelength excitation, which might have potential applications in the fields of as multi-color display and illumination.

It is shown that when light waves are scattered from a collection of particles with random distribution, the intensity distribution of the scattered field can be manipulated by properly controlling the distribution characteristics of particles in the collection. To illustrate this result, three special cases of a particulate medium are discussed to produce scattered spectral density with Gaussian distributions, circular flattened distributions, and ring-like distributions, respectively.

However, the dynamics of insulating antiferromagnets cannot be excited by an electric current, which is a method usually used to manipulate ferromagnetic metals. Here, we propose to use the voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy gradient as an excitation source to manipulate insulating antiferromagnetic textures. We analytically and numerically study the dynamics of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion driven by a magnetic anisotropy gradient. Our analytical calculations demonstrate that such a magnetic anisotropy gradient can effectively drive an antiferromagnetic skyrmion towards the area of lower magnetic anisotropy. The micromagnetic simulations are in good agreement with our analytical solution. Furthermore, the magnetic anisotropy gradient induced velocity of an antiferromagnetic skyrmion is compared to that of a ferromagnetic skyrmion. Our results are useful for the understanding of antiferromagnetic skyrmion dynamics and may open an alternative way for the design of antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

The calculation results show that the optimum arrangement can effectively reduce the difference of the total insertion loss in comparison to the random arrangement (i.e., 0.07 dB vs 2.67 dB in the cascaded encoder with 16 output ports). The proposed approach realizes the optimum configuration for the 1 x 2 optical splitters used without adding any extra components. The test results of the fabricated cascaded encoder with 32 output ports prove the feasibility of the proposed approach.

However, the insulativity of sulfur and the "shuttle effect" of polysulfides result in low utilization efficiency of active sulfur, fast capacity decay and inferior cycling stability, which pose the key challenge to their practical applications. Herein, a N, I-dual-doped hierarchical porous activated carbon (NIWFC) is successfully prepared for advanced Li-S batteries by the simple one-pot pyrolysis and hydrothermal processes. The obtained NIWFC owns interconnected porous framework with desirable specific surface area (2088.56 m(2) g(-1)) and large volume space (1.106 cm(3) g(-1)), which can accommodate high content of active sulfur and immobilize polysulfides through physical confinement. Moreover, the existence of N and I heteroatoms could effectively strengthen the chemical adsorption to polysulfides and create more active sites to enhance sulfur utilization. Attributed to these merits, impregnating sulfur into NIWFC (NIWFC/S) as cathode of Li-S batteries achieves a high initial discharge capacity of 1284.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C (remaining at 916.7 mAh g(-1) after 100 cycles) and the outstanding cycling stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.061% per cycle over 350 cycles at 1.0 C. This work provides a facile and cost-effective strategy to design a novel sustainable N, I-dual-doped porous carbon for high performance Li-S batteries and various energy storage fields.

The main target of this work is to explore the energy transformation and dynamic properties of DMF aqueous solution during the microwave heating process. The temperature variation, microwave heating rate and energy distribution have been obtained. The direct coupling of rotational motion, vibration and reorientation have been revealed during the microwave energy distribution, and there are two-thirds microwave energy are stored as the intermolecular energy. The structural characteristics are further obtained from the radial distribution functions, tetrahedral order parameters and hydrogen bond. Compare to the conventional heating, the molecular conformations show significant difference and the structure of aqueous solution is intensely disturbed. The apparent increase of diffusion coefficient discloses that high microwave frequency accelerates the molecules motion. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Cd2+ can transform into Cd-0 and Cd hydride (CdH2) gas vapor after hydride generation (HG) with KBH4. With the help of a simple, low power and low temperature UV atomizer, CdH2 can be converted to Cd-0 and thus the total Cd was detected. Due to the high atomization efficiency and low carrier gas dilution of the UV atomizer, the analytical system provides high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 0.006 ng mL(-1), which was comparable to those obtained by preconcentration methods. The relative standard deviation (RSD) (n = 11) was better than 2.1% at a concentration of 0.5 ng mL(-1). Its application was demonstrated by analyzing Certified Reference Materials and food samples for ultra-trace detection of Cd2+.

Here, we report a class of high performance self-healing elastomers (HiSHEs) with an exceptional combination of strength (up to 30 MPa), toughness (up to 32 kJ m(-2)) and healing efficiency (>80%). The HiSHEs are made of polyampholytes synthesized through kinetically controlled copolymerization of an acrylate monomer with long alkyl side groups and a pair of oppositely charged monomers that forms precipitates slowly. The acrylate monomer enables the formation of polymer chains of high mobility, while the oppositely charged monomers form gradient interactions by segregating into ionic aggregates with a wide range of sizes and stiffnesses. The weak interactions sacrifice progressively to dissipate energy, thereby enhancing the toughness, and the strong interactions impart the elastomers with high strength and elasticity. Moreover, the reversible gradient interactions also enable self-healing and multi-shape memory functions. By harnessing these functions, we design a mendable strain sensor with remarkably improved sensitivity.

Electrochemical fixation of N-2 to NH3 under ambient conditions is regarded as an eco-friendly and sustainable approach, but stable and efficient electrocatalysts are demanded for the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR). In this work, we report our recent finding that an Ag nanosheet acts as a high-performance NRR electrocatalyst at room temperature and pressure. Electrochemical tests in 0.1 M HCl reveal that such a catalyst achieves a high Faradaic efficiency of 4.8% and a NH3 yield rate of 4.62 x 10(-11) mol s(-1) cm(-2) at -0.60 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), rivaling the performances of most of the reported aqueous-based NRR electrocatalysts. Additionally, the Ag nanosheet also shows excellent selectivity, strong long-term electrochemical stability and durability.

Yet, direct detection of such states remains a challenge. Here, we propose spin-resolved transport in a junction between a normal metal and a spin-orbit coupled nodal-line semimetal as the mechanism for their detection. Specifically, we find that in such an interface the DSSs induce resonant spin-flipped reflection. This effect can be probed by both vertical spin transport and lateral charge transport between antiparallel magnetic terminals. In the tunneling limit of the junction, both spin and charge conductances exhibit a resonant peak around zero energy, providing unique evidence of the DSSs. This signature is robust to both dispersive DSSs and interface disorder. Based on numerical calculations, we show that the scheme can be implemented in the topological semimetal HgCr2Se4.

The effects of sintering temperature on the microstructures and electrochemical performances of the as-synthesized samples were systematically investigated through XRD, SEM and electrochemical performance characterization. When sintered at 650 degrees C, the obtained LiFe(MoO4)(2) microcrystals show regular shape and uniform size distribution with mean size of 1-2 mu m. At the lower temperature (600 degrees C), the obtained LiFe(MoO4)(2) microcrystals possess relative inferior crystallinity, irregular morphology and vague grain boundary. At the higher temperatures (680 and 700 degrees C), the obtained LiFe(MoO4)(2) microcrystals are larger and thicker particles. The electrochemical results demonstrate that the optimized LiFe(MoO4)(2) microcrystals (650 degrees C) can deliver a high discharge specific capacity of 925 mAh g(-1) even at a current rate of 1C (1,050 mA g(-1)) after 500 cycles. Our work can provide a good guidance for the controllable synthesis of other transition metal NASICON-type electrode materials.

With theories of r-cut set, fuzzy Caputo and Riemann-Liouville fractional differences are defined on a isolated time scale. Discrete Leibniz integral law is given by use of w-monotonicity conditions. Furthermore, equivalent fractional sum equations are established. Fuzzy discrete Mittag-Leffler functions are obtained by the Picard approximation. Finally, fractional discrete-time diffusion equations with uncertainty is investigated and exact solutions are expressed in form of two kinds of fuzzy discrete Mittag-Leffler functions. This paper suggests a discrete time tool for modeling discrete fractional systems with uncertainty. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The as-synthesized Ru nanoparticles with an average particle size of 1.41 nm were dispersed uniformly on the HPCM surface (Ru/HPCM). The Ru/HPCM catalyst exhibited a high turnover frequency of 440 min(-1) and could be reused for eight times in hydrogen generation from ammonia borane hydrolysis. The enhanced catalytic activity of Ru/HPCM could be attributed to the numerous active surface areas provided by ultrafine monodisperse Ru nanoparticles for the reaction. The confinement space of the support and the abundant surface functional groups increased the stability and reusability of the Ru/HPCM catalyst. This facile strategy for synthesis of ultrafine monodisperse metal nanoparticles with high catalytic activity and reusability shows potential for practical applications.

Herein, a linear structured plant polyphenol was employed as an amphiphilic stabilizer for preparing a series of amphiphilic Pd nanoparticles (PdNPs) colloids. For the as-prepared PdNPs colloids, the phenolic hydroxyls of plant polyphenols were responsible for the stabilization of PdNPs, whereas the rigid aromatic scaffold of plant polyphenols effectively suppressed the PdNPs from aggregation by providing a high steric effect. Thanks to the coexistence of hydrophilic phenolic hydroxyls and hydrophobic aromatic rings, the plant polyphenols induced tunable amphiphilic properties into the PdNPs, allowing an easier wetting of PdNPs with the substrate molecules. By tuning the content of plant polyphenols in the colloid, the particle size (3.17-4.73 nm) and the dispersity of the PdNPs were facilely controlled. When applied for atmospheric oxidation of insoluble alcohols in water by air, the amphiphilic PdNPs preferentially absorbed the alcohol substrates to create a relatively high-substrate-concentration microenvironment, which improved the mass transfer in the biphasic catalysis, allowing the proceeding of low-temperature (50 degrees C) atmospheric oxidation of diverse alcohols with high catalytic conversion, including aliphatic alcohols, cyclic aliphatic alcohols, and aromatic alcohols. Furthermore, the amphiphilic PdNPs colloid also exhibited excellent reusability with a conversion yield high up to 97.96% in the fifth cycle. In contrast, the control catalysts of poly(vinylpyrrolidone)- and poly(ethylene glycol)-stabilized PdNPs were completely inactivated in the fifth cycle. As a consequence, our findings provided a new route for developing an environmentally benign aqueous colloid catalyst that is both highly active and recyclable for mild biphasic oxidation reaction systems.

The as-prepared composite was characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD, XPS, VSM and N-2 adsorption/desorption experiments. A novel heterogeneous Fenton-like system, composed of Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 composite and dissolved oxygen (02) in solution, which can in situ generate H2O2 and (OH)-O-center dot, was used for the degradation of 4-chlorophenol (4-CP). The influences of various operational parameters, including the initial pH, dosage of Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 and initial concentration of 4-CP on the removal of 4-CP were investigated. The removal efficiencies of 4-CP and total organic carbon (TOC) were 99% and 57%, respectively, at the initial pH of 1.5, Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4 dosage of 2 g/L, 4-CP initial concentration of 50 mg/L and oxygen flow rate of 400 mL/min. Based on the results of the radical scavenger effect study, the hydroxyl radical was considered as the main reactive oxidants in Zn-0-CNTs-Fe3O4/O-2 system and a possible degradation pathway of 4-CP was proposed.

(NH4)(2)SbCl(SO4)(2) exhibits a three-dimensional framework constructed of [SbCl(SO4)(2)](2-) chains and NH4+ ions. And the NH4+ cations play the role of charge balance and provide the hydrogen bond constructed with oxygen atoms. (NH4)-SbCl2(SO4) shows a two-dimensional layer structure that is composed of the regularly stacked [SbCl2(SO4)](-) chains via hydrogen-bonding interactions. Both of the titled compounds possess the same chemical composition and the similar Sb-Cl-SO4 chains, while hydrogen-bonding interactions and lone-pair cations play the synergistic effect on the framework structures and macroscopic centricities resulting in that the (NH4)(2)SbCl(SO4)(2) is centrosymmetric and the (NH4)SbCl2(SO4) is non-centrosymmetric (NCS). Powder second harmonic generation (SHG) measurements indicated that the NCS compound (NH4)SbCl2(SO4) is type I phase-matchable and exhibits SHG responses of similar to 1.7 times that of KH2PO4.

Influential factors on the treatment of concentrated leachate with the pure Fenton and microwave-Fenton method were investigated. For the conventional Fenton process, the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand (CODCr), UV254, and the color number (CN) reached 84%, 87%, and 96%, respectively, with the biodegradability (BOD5/CODCr) increased from 0.13 to 0.51 at an initial pH of 5.0, Fe2+ of 0.04 mol/L, a n(H2O2)/n(Fe2+) ratio of 8 after a reaction time of 3 h. When incorporating the Fenton process with microwave irradiation, a comparative CODCr and UV254, and the CN removal rate of 75%, 83%, and 95%, and a high BOD5/CODCr of 0.62 were achieved under a microwave power of 390 W and an extremely shortened reaction time of only 8 min. Meanwhile, sludge quantity showed a reduction of 24.7%, decreased from 8.50 g/L to 6.40 g/L after the participation of microwave. In addition, molecular-weight fraction (MWF), UV-visible spectrum (UV-vis), and 3D-EEM spectrum tests demonstrated that the macromolecular and complex organic compounds in the wastewater were significantly decomposed into small molecular matters. Our results found that microwave-Fenton is a promising technology for concentrated leachate treatment, with much shorter reaction time, lower sludge production, and enhanced biodegradability, as well as comparative organic matter removal performance.

In this study, zero valent iron and hydrogen peroxide (ZVI/H2O2) coupled with microwave irradiation were used to treat the SAARB leachate. The effects of the initial pH, ZVI dosage, H2O2 dosage, microwave (MW) power, and reaction time were systematically investigated. Results showed that under optimum conditions [initial pH of 3.0, (ZVI)(0) = 0.2 g L-1, (H2O2) 0 = 7.5 mL L-1, MW power = 450 W and reaction time = 14 min], the removal efficiencies of chemical oxygen demand, substances absorbing ultraviolet light at 254 nm, and reductions of color number were 28.11%, 48.60%, and 81.21%, respectively. In control experiments, the best treatment was achieved in the combined MW-ZVI/H2O2 process, which indicated a synergetic treatment effect of MW, ZVI and H2O2. Two fluorescent components were identified by parallel factor analysis as fulvic-like substances and humic-like substances. Both of these substances were greatly degraded in the MW-ZVI/H2O2 process, resulting in a sharp reduction of organic matter concentration, molecular weight, and condensation degree, and a significant improvement in the biodegradability of the resulting effluent. Various analyses showed that iron ions could be leached from ZVI, generating iron-based oxides (e.g., FeO, Fe2O3, and FeOOH) in particles of ZVI, which may catalyze the Fenton process. Therefore, in the MW-ZVI/H2O2 process, the removal mechanism of fulvic-and humic-like substances included heterogeneous and homogeneous Fenton reactions, and adsorption and precipitation of ironbased oxides, all of which were promoted by MW energy. As a result, the MW-ZVI/H2O2 process was highly efficient in treating the SAARB leachate.

Crops grown in field are often exposed simultaneously to abiotic and biotic stress, and responses of plants to co-stress by two or more factors may differ from those to each of the multiple stresses. Using in vitro cultures, we demonstrated that virus infection (singly and in combination) or salt, and co-stress by virus infection (singly and in combination) and salt significantly reduced growth and microtuber production, and caused severely oxidative cell damage determined by levels of O-2(-) and methane dicarboxylic aldehyde, and H2O2 localization in situ. Alterations in physiological metabolism by increasing total soluble sugar and free proline, and by decreasing chlorophyll content are responses of potato plantlets to virus infection (singly and in combination) or salt stress and co-stress by virus infection (singly and in combination) and salt. Oxidative cell damage and reduced chlorophyll content caused by virus and/or salt are believed to be responsible for the reduced growth, eventually resulting in decreased tuber yield. Results reported here would help us to better understand possible mechanism of reduced tuber yield by virus infection and/or salt stress.

Litter decomposition supplies nutrients and energy within and among aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. It is driven by several biotic and abiotic factors, the relative importance of which may change during litter decay. However, to date, very few studies have addressed the temporal dynamics of such factors across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, which limits our understanding of litter decomposition process. 2. To assess the temporal dynamics of major abiotic and biotic litter decomposition drivers, we conducted a 2-year field experiment to evaluate the losses of foliar litter carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in alpine streams, riparian zones and forest floors. Environmental (soil, water and climatic) factors were continuously monitored, and incubated plant litter was sampled over time to assess temporal changes in litter chemistry and microbial diversity. 3. We analysed sequential litter decomposition stages based on mass-loss intervals and used structural equation modelling to disentangle the relative importance of each biotic and abiotic driver. 4. Our results suggested that across the aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems, litter C and N loss was generally controlled by a common hierarchy of drivers: (a) Environment and initial litter quality regulated C and N loss via both direct and indirect effects, and their total effects were mainly significant in the early and late decomposition stages, respectively; (b) changes in litter chemistry significantly influenced litter decomposition throughout the decomposition process, mainly via direct effects; and (c) microbial diversity per se showed minimal effects on litter C and N loss. 5. The identified common hierarchy of biotic and abiotic drivers and their direct and indirect effects on C and N loss at different decomposition stages across aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems indicates the possibility of integrating aquatic and terrestrial decomposition into a single framework for future construction of models accounting for temporal dynamics of litter decomposition.

The results show that there is a difference between x (or y)-direction and z-direction in the response to a shock wave velocity of 12 km/s. It was shown that detonation temperature and pressure in the z-direction lags behind that of x-direction (or y-direction). Moreover, from the time evolution of the population of various key fragments, we also observe that along with z-direction significantly later than that of x (or y)-direction, which the reaction rate is also slower. Thus, we draw a conclusion that sensitive for shock propagation along x or y-direction, but less sensitive for shock propagation along z-direction. (C) 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

As an important raw material of local ethnic minority tea, ethnomedicines and food supplements in southwestern areas of China, Docynia indica (Wall.) Decne (DID) mainly consists of phlorizin (PHZ), which is the main active component. In this study, the holistic activities and the interactions of components of PHZ, non-phlorizin (NP) in the DID extract (DIDE) were evaluated. A rapid and effective high-speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) was performed to knock out PHZ from DIDE and the purity of PHZ was 96.01% determined by HPLC, with a recovery rate of 96.76%. After 13 weeks of treatment course in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese mice model, the results revealed that the DIDE and PHZ significantly decreased weight gain, blood lipid levels, hyperplasia of adipocytes and alleviated inflammation (p < 0.05). Both DIDE and PHZ improves insulin resistance (p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the intestinal barrier function was improved compared to HFD group, through the determination of serum lipopolysaccharides (LPS), glucagon-likepeptide-2 (GLP-2) and hematoxylin-eosin staining of jejunum. Interestingly, after NP treatment, the metabolic syndrome of the HFD-induced obesity appeared to have a similar improvement. All the experiments showed that there is a synergistic weakening phenomenon when PHZ and NP interact with each other in the mixed state. In conclusion, for the PHZ and NP showing a good effect on anti-obesity, anti-inflammation, and intestinal barrier function, DIDE could be a good source of functional food to prevent obesity.

In this work, Nb2O5 nanofiber is experimentally proved to act as a non-noble-metal NRR electrocatalyst for N-2 conversion to NH3 with high activity and selectivity. When tested in 0.1 M HCl, such Nb2O5 nanofiber achieves a high average NH3 yield (43.6 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)) and a high Faradaic efficiency (9.26%) at - 0.55 V vs. reversible hydrogen electrode, rivaling the performances of most reported aqueous-based NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions and even comparable with those under high temperature and pressure. Notably, it also shows high stability during electrolysis and recycling test. The catalytic mechanism of NRR on Nb2O5 (181) surface is further discussed by density functional theory calculations.

We define the mean field S(t) and derive the steady-state output amplitude by using the stochastic average method. We characterize the effects of fractional order, intrinsic frequency, noise correlation rate, and driving frequency on the steady-state output amplitude as a function of noise intensity. We observe that the collective SR phenomenon occurs in a fractional coupled stochastic dynamic system. We also demonstrate that collective SR behavior versus noise intensity can ensue when system parameters satisfy the necessary and sufficient conditions; this notion means that we can control the collective SR of our fractional dynamic model by properly adjusting the system parameters within a certain range. This study verifies the reliability and effectiveness of the theoretical results by various numerical simulations. Our results on SR in a globally coupled fractional harmonic oscillator provide useful information in modern science.

The prominent characteristic of the MSM operator is that it can capture the interrelationship among multi-input arguments. Motivated by the ideal characteristic of the MSM operator, in this paper, we expand the MSM operator, generalized MSM (GMSM), and dual MSM (DMSM) operator with interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy numbers (IV2TLPFNs) to propose the interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy MSM (IV2TLPFMSM) operator, interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy weighted MSM (IV2TLPFWMSM) operator, interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy GMSM (IN2TLPFGMSM) operator, interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy weighted GMSM (IV2TLPFWGMSM) operator, interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy DMSM (IN2TLPFDMSM) operator, Interval-valued 2-tuple linguistic Pythagorean fuzzy weighted DMSM (IV2TLPFWDMSM) operator. Then the multiple attribute decision making (MADM) methods are developed with these three operators. Finally, an example of green supplier selection is used to show the proposed methods.

A new four-qubit Bell inequality is optimally violated by -type entangled state, but not by four-qubit GHZ, W and cluster state. Hence, -type entangled state is a good candidate to implement simultaneous dense coding. In this paper, we propose a simultaneous dense coding protocol with genuine four-particle entangled state, -type entangled state, in which two receivers can simultaneously obtain their respective classical information sent by a sender. The double controlled-NOT operator, which is used as the locking operator, play a crucial role in our protocol. The security of simultaneous dense coding is analyzed against the intercept-resend attack. The preparation of -type entangled state has been studied in various physics systems, and it has been experimentally generated with nearly deterministic scheme and high generation rate. Thus, our protocol is feasible with the current experimental technology.

The rectangular detecting pulses with two different pulse widths are sequentially injected into the faulty fiber link to generate corresponding parameters for the established model equations. We also investigate the corresponding variables (i.e., different combinations of dual pulse widths, pulse repetition frequency and accuracy of the power meter) that may affect the performance of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the fiber breakpoint can be located with little error. The simple and low-cost method provides a fault localization functionality for the PON monitoring systems.

Due to the breaking of time reversal symmetry in a magnetic system, nodal lines require protection by additional symmetries. Here, we report the discovery of antiferromagnetic type-I and type-II nodal lines coexisting in the monolayer CrAs2 based on a systematic first-principles calculation. Remarkably, the type-I nodal line in CrAs2 is filling enforced by nonsymmorphic analog symmetry and robust against spin-orbital coupling. The type-II nodal lines are protected by the mirror symmetry in the absence of spin-orbital coupling. The antiferromagnetic monolayer CrAs2 proposed here may provide a platform for the correlation between magnetism and exotic topological phases.

Here, phosphorus-doped carbon (PPC) derived from hypercrosslinked polymer networks of triphenylphosphine and benzene was employed as support to synthesize Ru/PPC through the in situ stabilization of ultrafine and uniform Ru nanoclusters (NCs). It was found that the Ru NCs with a mean diameter of 1.13 nm dispersed well on the PPC surface. The Ru/PPC exhibited a high turnover frequency of 413 mol H-2 (mol(Ru).min)(-l) under mild conditions. The high catalytic performance of Ru/PPC could be ascribed to the small size of metal, which can offer more catalytically active components for the reaction. This work reveals that the PPC has promising potential catalyst support in stabilizing metal NCs for AB hydrolysis to generate hydrogen. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

In general, high-performance single-phase multiferroics are extremely rare, owing to the incompatibility between ferroelectricity and magnetism. The most interesting property that makes multiferroics useful in device applications is the direct and significant magnetoelectric coupling at room temperature, resulting in a hysteretic magnetoelectric response. However, it still remains a great challenge to realize such a cross-coupling hysteresis loop between the ferroelectric and magnetic orders, i.e. an effective magnetic command of polarization, or an electric-field command of magnetization in a single-phase bulk material. Here we report the multiferroic behavior of chemically modified bismuth ferrite, Bi0.88Dy0.12Fe0.97Ti0.03O3+delta, which exhibits simultaneous (weak) ferromagnetism and ferroelectricity. More interestingly, this solid solution shows an evident magnetoelectric effect at a low magnetic field by demonstrating a hysteretic loop that characterizes the electric voltage signal as a function of bias magnetic field. Moreover, the room-temperature magnetoelectric effect with the saturated magnetoelectric coefficient up to +/- 0.23 my/cm.Oe at +/- 250 Oe is obtained. The observed properties are attributed to the combination of linear magnetoelectric effect and domain wall motion. This result points to potential new applications of singlephase multiferroic materials in spintronic devices in which electric dipoles can be effectively tuned by a magnetic field.

To date, the progress made in this area has mainly relied on the reaction of small rings, which is driven by releasing ring strain. Encouragingly, more and more examples of the cleavage of non-strained C-C bonds have been reported. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the transition-metal-catalyzed C-C bond activation of relatively stable and unstrained molecules that involves the formation of organometallic intermediates. In the first section we focus on the C-C bond activation achieved through beta-carbon elimination, and in the second section the oxidative addition of the C-C bond to low-valent metal is summarized in detail.

Nevertheless, most of the catalysts still suffer from the complex synthetic procedures combined with limited catalytic activity. Additionally, the facile syntheses of Rh catalysts with high efficiencies for both electrochemical water splitting and AB hydrolysis are still challenging. Herein, we develop a simple, green, and mass-producible ion-adsorption strategy to produce a Rh/C pre-catalyst (pre-Rh/C). The ultrafine and clean Rh nanoclusters immobilized on carbon are achieved via the insitu reduction of the pre-Rh/C during the hydrogen-evolution process. The resulting insitu Rh/C catalyst presents an outstanding electrocatalytic performance with low overpotentials of 8 and 30mV at 10mAcm(-2) in 1.0m KOH and 0.5m H2SO4, respectively, outperforming the state-of-the-art Pt catalysts. Furthermore, the insitu Rh/C is also highly active for AB hydrolysis to produce hydrogen with a high turnover frequency of 1246molH2 mol(Rh)(-1)min(-1) at 25 degrees C. The insitu-formed ultrafine Rh nanoclusters are responsible for the observed superior catalytic performance. This facile insitu strategy to realize a highly active catalyst shows promise for practical applications.

LATRONUM; RODENTIA; SYSTEMATICS; TAXONOMY; MURIDAE; TAIWAN; KOREA; DRACO	Apodemus (mice) and Rattus (rats) are the top rodent reservoirs for zoonoses in China, yet little is known about their diversity. We reexamined the alpha diversity of these two genera based on a new collection of specimens from China and their cyt b sequences in GenBank. We also tested whether species could be identified using external and craniodental measurements exclusively. Measurements from 147 specimens of Apodemus and 233 specimens of Rattus were used for morphological comparisons. We analysed 74 cyt b sequences of Apodemus and 100 cyt b sequences of Rattus to facilitate phylogenetic estimations. Results demonstrated that nine species of Apodemus and seven species of Rattus, plus a new subspecies of Rattus nitidus, are distributed in China. Principal component analysis using external and craniodental measurements revealed that measurements alone could not separate the recognized species. The occurrence of Rattus pyctoris in China remains uncertain.

However, most of the well-known transition metal nitrides are nitrogen deficient. The reports on nitrogen-rich TM nitrides are rather scarce and sometimes even show discrepancy in their crystal structures. Herein, the microstructure, stability, electronic property, and hardness of nitrogen-rich molybdenum nitride MoN2 compound have been investigated systematically by using an unbiased structure search method crystal structure analysis by particle swarm optimization combined with first-principle calculations. Our study demonstrates a stable configuration orthorhombic Cmc2(1) (no. 36) for MoN2 crystal, which is even lower in energy than the experimental synthesized structure rhombohedral R3m-MoN2 at ambient pressure condition. The formation enthalpies with respect to the reactant Mo + N-2, mechanical stabilities, and phonon dispersions further confirm the stability of Cmc2(1) MoN2 phase at the whole ambient condition, indicating that it can be synthesized in experiment. According to the density of states, it is seen that all the considered MoN2 exhibit metallic behavior and have two types of bonds (covalent and ionic). The Vicker hardness of Cmc2(1)-MoN2 is calculated as 11.987 GPa, and the strength and number of covalent bonds may dominate its hardness.

However, not every individual who is characterized by psychopathy engages in aggression, which suggests that certain factors may attenuate the intensity of the relations between psychopathy and aggression. The purpose of the current study was to explore the protective roles of the consideration of future consequences (CFC) (high CFC-Future and low CFC-Immediate) in attenuating aggression related to psychopathy using proactive aggression (Study 1) and cyber-aggression (Study 2) behavior indexes. College students (Study 1; N = 1,058) and adults (Study 2; N= 350) voluntarily participated in this study. The results demonstrated that the relationship between psychopathy and aggressive behaviors was moderated by CFC-Future and CFC-Immediate. Individuals with high psychopathy scores who also had high CFC-Future scores or low CFC-Immediate scores exhibited less proactive aggression (Study 1) and left fewer aggressive online comments on news websites (Study 2). The results of the present study suggested that CFC serves as a buffer against aggression related to psychopathy and aggression.

Here, we demonstrate that a N/O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon can be derived from soybean dreg through a facile KOH activation and high-temperature carbonization for high performance electrode material of supercapacitor in both aqueous (6.0 M KOH) and ionic liquid (EMIMBF4) electrolytes. The material carbonize at 800 degrees C possesses a high ion-accessible surface (1837.26 m(2) g(-1)) induced by the interconnected 3D network and a high level of micropores (0.71 cm(3) g(-1)), which are beneficial for large-scale ion storage and high-speed ion transport. Furthermore, high contents of nitrogen (1.58 at.%) and oxygen (11.41 at.%) can induce the contribution of faradaic pseudocapacitance for electric double-layer capacitor (EDLCs). As a result, the N/O co-doped hierarchical porous carbon derived from waste soybean dregs displays a superior specific capacity of 321.1 F g(-1) at the current density of 1 A g(-1), high rate capability of 249.7 F g(-1) at 30 A g(-1) and excellent cycling durability of 99.5% at 1 A g(-1) after 10 000 cycles in three electrode system using 6 M KOH electrolyte. Notably, an excellent energy density can reach as high as 22.1 Wh kg(-1) at the power density of 875.0 W kg(-1) in two-electrode system using EMIMBF4 electrolyte. This green, renewable and eco-friendly biomass porous carbon might be widely used in the fields of energy conversion device for now and in the foreseeable future. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

The error of Brillouin frequency shift (BFS) due to Brillouin pump depletion was compared for DBA-BOTDA using non-cyclic and cyclic coding. For non-cyclic coding, significant over-and under-shoots of BFS were found in the range with larger BFS variation, such as hot spot. The impact of Brillouin pump depletion can be reduced considerably by cyclic coding. Furthermore, to compensate the BFS error due to nonlinear amplification, a simple and effective log linearization was proposed and demonstrated.

The local density approximation plus U (LDA + U) and generalized gradient approximation plus U (GGA + U) methods are used to interpret the strong Coulomb repulsion among the localized Ce 4f electrons. Without the effective U parameters, the obtained ground state of the ferromagnetic (FM) metal is not consistent with the experimental result. However, we can get the antiferromagnetic (AFM2: the magnetic ground state) insulating ground state for CeVO4 by LDA + U and GGA + U. It reveals that the result is in agreement with the experiment. For AFM2 CeVO4, the dependence of properties on the U parameters has been studied in detail. The effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has also been investigated in detail. The demonstrated properties include volume, lattice parameters, bandgap, the density of states (DOS) and spin magnetic moment of Ce atom. With the Hubbard U parameter around 6 eV, the lattice parameters (a = 7:396 angstrom, V = 351:82 angstrom(3), c/a = 0:874), bulk modulus B-0 (121 GPa), insulating gap (2.157 eV) and magnetic moment (0.97 mu(B) per Ce atom) are consistent with the experiments and other theoretical results. Besides, the elasticity-related properties and optical properties have also been calculated for U = 0; 2; 4 and 6 eV.

However, it is still a challenge to fabricate multi-functional aerogels. Here we use an environmentally friendly method to obtain multi-functional hybrid aerogels by chemical integration of water-borne polyurethane (WPU) and graphene oxide (GO). In the hybrid aerogels, covalent networks are formed in WPU itself and between WPU molecules and GO sheets through the deblocking and condensation reactions, while physical networks are formed by stacking between GO sheets and phase separation in WPU. The existence of both physical and chemical networks imparts high mechanical property and excellent shape-memory capability to the hybrid aerogels. The interfaces between different networks play a role of phonon-scattering, thus enabling a low thermal conductivity for the hybrid aerogels. Moreover, rough structures on the surface endow the hybrid aerogels with high hydrophobicity. The multi-functionality properties presented in this paper provide a potential usage of aerogels with a wide range of thermal-insulating characteristics which can improve the energy efficiency effectively.

By pouring fresh water over saltwater in the tank, a layer of saline water with a fixed gradient was created. Convective turbulence was then formed by heating the bottom of the tank. The temperatures at different heights were measured using eight thermocouples; thus, the average temperatures and temperature fluctuations at different heights were calculated. The salinity profile was obtained by moving a conductivity probe up and down to measure the conductivity. Two-dimensional light intensity grayscale images were recorded after transmitting a collimated laser beam through the water tank, after which the normalized variance and power spectra of the light intensity fluctuations at different heights were calculated. The results showed that the saltwater in the tank could be divided by height into two layers, namely, the mixed layer and entrainment zone, according to the profiles of the average temperature and average salinity under the experimental conditions. Different portions of the images showed different characteristics. The part corresponding to the saltwater mixed layer was similar to that corresponding to the mixed layer in the fresh water experiment. However, a two-peak structure was observed in the curve of the normalized light intensity spectrum calculated from the grayscale values in the part corresponding to the bottom of the entrainment zone, whereas a two-peak structure was not found in the light intensity fluctuation spectrum corresponding to the mixed layer. According to the refractive index fluctuation spectrum model, one peak was due to temperature fluctuations, and the other peak was due to salinity fluctuations. It can be concluded that the salinity contribution to the refractive index fluctuation in the entrainment zone was larger than that in the mixed layer. Moreover, spectral analysis showed that in the saltwater, the inner scale of turbulent temperature fluctuation was approximately 1.9 mm, while the inner scale of turbulent salinity fluctuation was approximately 0.1 mm. These findings will be helpful for us to understand the microstructural characteristics of seawater turbulence and guide the implementation of optical transmission experiments in seawater.

However, the method is severely challenged by N-2 activation and needs efficient N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts. Here, we report that multishelled hollow Cr2O3 microspheres (MHCMs), which are synthesized by a facile synthetic route, can serve as efficient and selective non-noble metal electrocatalysts for NRR. In 0.1 M Na2SO4 solution, the MHCMs achieve a high Faradaic efficiency (6.78%) and a large NH3 yield (25.3 mu g h(-1) mg(cat)(-1)) at -0.9 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. The MHCMs also exhibit high stability during the reaction. Density functional theory calculations suggest that NRR over MHCMs occurs via both distal associative and partially alternative routes.

Herein, a facile and convenient strategy using tris(2,2'-bipyridyl)ruthenium(H) chloride hexahydrate as precursor is developed for synthesizing ultrafine and highly dispersed ruthenium nanoclusters on carbon support. It is discovered that the preadsorption of Ru precursor on carbon substrate and followed by pyrolysis are very crucial for the synthesis of such Ru nanoclusters. Among as-prepared samples, Ru/CN-800 shows the best HER electrocatalytic performance in alkaline solution, which outperforms the benchmark Pt/C and recently reported catalysts. The excellent performance of Ru/CN-800 was presumably attributed to the dominant metallic Ru as well as the ultrasmall Ru nanoclusters with a satisfied dispersion, which provides the massive highly active sites for HER This facile and environmental-friendly pathway for synthesis of ultrasmall Ru nanoclusters with high HER activity shows a promise in practical applications.

The effects of culture conditions on MBF-B16 production, including carbon source, nitrogen source, C/N ratio, initial pH, and culture temperature, were investigated in this study. Results showed that 6.96 g of MBF-B16 could be extracted from a 1-L culture broth under optimized conditions. Chemical analysis showed that polysaccharide and protein were the main components. The neutral sugar consisted of galactose only, which was proposed in Klebsiella genus for the first time. In addition, a composite flocculant (CF) that contains polyaluminum ferric chloride (PAFC) and MBF-B16 for the removal of turbidity and SS in drinking water was optimized by response surface methodology. CF could reduce PAFC dosage by about 56.2-72%. Charge neutralization and adsorption bridging effect were the primary flocculation mechanisms. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Calculated conformational energy and mean square displacement (MSD) delineated that rigid cage of TSP-POSS unit as an anchoring substituent, inhibited and rigidified polymer chains apparently. The degree of such reinforcement depended on TSP-POSS moieties plays a critical role in determining the final glass transition temperature (Tg) by competing with the effect of epoxy soft segments in bulk structures. At TSP-POSS loading less than 30%.w/w, rigid cages tended to approach mutually and the anchoring effect was strengthened. The restricted mobility and reinforced rigidity of chains led to an improvement of Tg. At TSP-POSS loading over 30%.w/w, increasing rigid cages were fixed by soft segments of epoxy unit and thus, the anchoring effect was weakened and mobility of chains was released to some extent. Additionally, with a steady plasticization mechanism, Tg was slightly decreased in 40%.w/w TSP-POSS embedded in epoxy, which was confirmed by experiments.

The FWHM is nearly four times larger than that of a single band absorber. In addition, the absorptivity of each peak can be independently tuned by phase modulation. Since only magnetic resonances in the form of catenary optical fields in the upper and lower dielectric layers can be excited for symmetrical inputs. the number of absorption peaks will be reduced by half at this time. The absorption frequency under symmetrical inputs can be flexibly selected from low frequency to high frequency by changing the material of the upper and lower dielectric layers. Moreover, the bandwidth in optimized broadband absorber is enhanced by 9 times while high absorbance is maintained. The characteristic of the enhancing absorption bandwidth and the selective absorption may allow our metasurface to be used in many applications such as optical switch and modulators.

However, less is known about the psychological mechanisms underlying this association. Here, we tested the role of mindfulness in mediating this association in Chinese adolescents who attended high schools. In Study 1 (N = 1262), we first verified the association between the grit and subjective well-being, given that this association has not been reported in the Chinese population. Consistent with the previous literature, higher levels of grit were associated with higher levels of life satisfaction, more positive affect, and less negative affect. In Study 2 (N = 627), we replicated the association between grit and subjective well-being. More importantly, mediation analyses demonstrated that the association was partly mediated by mindfulness. Together, our findings suggest that the grit may help boost adolescents' subjective well-being through their mindful mind in pursuing their long-term goals.

However, high tropical diversity is partly attributable to niche shifts within evolutionary lineages. Crocodile newts (genera Echinotriton and Tylototriton) are a monophyletic group endemic to south-east Asia, and are one of the few lineages of urodeles that appear in tropical regions. Here, we examined the patterns of ecological diversification within the crocodile newts based on 207 records of 23 species. The niche space was described according to topographic, climatic variables (temperature, rainfall, and seasonality) and forest cover. Our analysis showed that the occurrence of most of these species was strongly associated with the precipitation regime and seasonality. The diversification patterns of the crocodile newts are complex, showing both conservatism and divergence. These patterns can be related to the Tibetan uplift phase during the Neogene, resulting in the emergence of new montane habitats and subsequent changes in the palaeo-drainage system and climate. The range of ecological diversification within a lineage is possibly the result of several interacting processes, including environmental heterogeneity, the regional climatic history, and physiological constraints on species.

Most existing studies assumed that sensors are powered with off-the-shelf batteries, e.g., Lithium batteries, which are cheap, but it takes some non-trivial time to fully charge such a battery (e.g., 30-80 min). The long charging time may incur long sensor dead durations, especially when there are many lifetime-critical sensors to be charged. On the other hand, other studies assumed that every sensor is powered with an ultra-fast charging battery, where it only takes some trivial time to replenish such a battery, e.g., 1 min, but the adoption of many ultra-fast sensors will bring about high purchasing cost. In this paper, we propose a novel heterogeneous sensor network model, in which there are only a few ultra-fast sensors and many low-cost off-the-shelf sensors. The deployment cost of the network in the model is low, as the number of ultra-fast sensors is limited. We also have an important observation that we can significantly shorten sensor dead durations by enabling the ultra-fast sensors to relay more data for lifetime-critical off-the-shelf sensors. We then propose a joint charging scheduling and routing allocation algorithm, such that the longest sensor dead duration is minimized. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm through extensive simulation experiments. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is very promising and the longest sensor dead duration by it is only about 10% of those by existing algorithms.

Inspired by traditional Chinese steamed buns, herein a unique porous microcellular carbon composed of cross-linked nanopores has been synthesized by an eco-friendly biological fermentation using banana peel as a carbon precursor. The specially hierarchical carbon framework obtained under the aerobic respiration and anaerobic breathing of biological yeast during fermenting, and simultaneously the inherent doping of N (3.28 at. %), produce a promising carbon host material to stabilize the structure of electrodes and restrict the dissolution of polysulfides during charging and discharging. The amount of biological yeast has an important influence on the microstructure of the biomass carbons and the correlated electrochemical properties of carbon/sulfur electrodes. The optimal amount of biological yeast is 3.0 wt %, where the carbon/sulfur composite electrode possesses a sulfur loading of 74.34 wt % and achieves a large initial reversible capacity of 1174 mAh g(-1) at 0.1 C and a high capacity hold of 58.35% after 100 cycles.

The authors interviewed participants to collect dreams and then explored similarities and differences through content analysis. Atotal of 127 participants reported their dreams, 65 monks and 62 nonreligious respondents. Results suggest a significant difference in dream themes between monks and nonreligious respondents. Compared with nonreligious respondents, there were more "prediction" and "revelation" themes in the monks' dreams. Meanwhile, nonreligious respondents had more "death dream" and "others" than monks did. About the characters in the dream, "divine beings" and "teachers" appeared more often in the dreams reported by the monks, whereas "relatives," "animals," and "dead people" presented more in dreams of nonreligious respondents. There were also significant differences in the emotions expressed in the dreams between the two groups, with monks reporting more peaceful and reverent emotions than nonreligious respondents, as well as less anxiety. About the reaction to the dreams, monks chose "chanting and praying" more often than nonreligious respondents. The importance of the results was analyzed in relation to the characteristic of Buddhism and the living environment.

In this study, the cold active endoglucanase CeIX from psychrotrophic Pseudoalteromonas sp. DY3 was successfully overexpressed in E. coli, partly purified and characterized in detail. CeIX showed the highest activity at pH 5.5, and exhibited moderate activity and superior pH stability over a wide pH range (pH 5.0-pH 9.0). It displayed the highest activity at 45 degrees C, and kept 34.7% residual activity even at 5 degrees C. It was stable below 35 degrees C and lost activity very quickly above 45 degrees C, which is consistent with its cold adaptability. The apparent kinetic parameters CeIX against CMC (carboxymethyl cellulose) were determined, with the K-m and k(cat) values of 6.4 mg/ml and 4.2 s(-1) respectively. Mn2+ and Co2+ enhanced the cellulolytic activity of CeIX by 28.8% and 20.6% respectively, whereas Pb2+ and Cu2+ inhibited its activity by 14.9% and 6.5% separately. The cold adaptation of CeIX is possibly due to the presence of the unusually long linker between the catalytic module and the cellulose-binding domain. (C) 2018 Published by Elsevier B.V.

In the presence of Hg2+, the red fluorescence from BSA-AuNCs was quenched while the green fluorescein was inert thus as a reference. And it presented traffic light-type (red, yellow and green) color in the low, middle and high concentration of Hg2+. A potential mechanism was investigated by Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The selective quenching mechanism may be due to the formation of gold amalgam bonds between BSA-AuNCs and Hg2+. A linear correlation was constructed for Hg2+ in the concentration range of 10-500 mu g L-1. A limit of detection (LOD) of 7.4 mu g L-1 and a relative standard deviation (FISH, n = 7) of 0.4% were obtained, which can be used to monitor the concentration of Hg2+. In visual detection, as low as 0.1 mu g mL(-1) of Hg2+ can be easily discriminated from the blank with the naked eye. The proposed method was validated by analysis of certified environment and food samples with satisfactory results.

In this method, the calculated projected-surface-area size distribution is obtained by the fitting of the measured projected-surface-area size distribution with a polynomial,and then the number density distribution is derived from the calculated projected-surface-area distribution. Meanwhile, the scattering matrix element F-11 of one particle at more narrow bins is calculated according to the scattering intensity with unpolarized light incidence. Furthermore, the simulated scattering matrix element F-11 of the ensemble of aerosol particles is obtained by the numerical integral method. The simulated scattering matrix element F-11 of the ensemble of aerosol particles can be calculated with full scattering angles and wavelengths. In addition, the direct fitting of the measured scattering matrix element F-11 is conducted for comparison. Meanwhile, the spheroid model is use to research the real nonsphericity effect on the scattering matrix element F-11. Simulation results indicate that fairly reasonable results of the scattering matrix element F-11 for the polydispersed aerosol particles can be obtained at full scattering angles with this proposed method, which can provide a reliable and efficient approach to reproduce the scattering matrix element F-11 of real aerosol particles.

The conventional method is to model a variable-mass system driven by both multiplicative and additive noises. In this paper, an improved mathematical model is created based on generalized Langevin equations (GLE) to characterize the random interaction with locally fluctuating number of coupled particles in the elastically coupled factional Brownian motors (FBM). By the numerical simulations, the effect of fluctuating interactions on collective transport behaviors is investigated, and some abnormal phenomena, such as cooperative behaviors, stochastic resonance (SR) and anomalous transport, are observed in the regime of sub diffusion.

The XRD and FT-IR results show that all the as-fabricated microcrystals are tetragonal symmetry with scheelite structure, and the doping concentration of Li+ has great influence on the lattice parameters of the finally obtained LixNa1-xEu(WO4)(2) crystals. The SEM results indicate that all samples are well crystallized, exhibited irregular spherical particles with various mean grain size. Moreover, the mean grain size of the final LixNa1-xEu(WO4)(2) solid solution crystals increases with increasing concentration of Li+ ions besides LiEu(WO4)(2) and NaEu(WO4)(2). The luminescence spectra reveal that all the LixNa1-xEu(WO4)(2) phosphors can exhibit the two characteristic emissions located at 615 nm and 592 nm under 393 nm UV excitation. Moreover, the observed emission intensities of the emission peak at 615 nm are obviously fluctuant with x, whereas the intensities of the emission peak located at 592 nm have no obvious variation. All the obtained LixNa1-xEu(WO4)(2) phosphors can emit warm pure red emissions with the correlated color temperature (CCT) from 2100 to 2300 K. Especially, for the as-fabricated Li.Na-1.Eu-9(WO4)(2) phosphor, the coordinate (x = 0.6508, y = 0.3474) are much closer to the International Association of Lighting NTSC trichromatic coordinates specified red coordinate (x = 0.67, y = 0.33) than that of Y2O2S: Eu3+ (x = 0.63, y = 0.35), showing that is a promising warm red phosphor with excellent luminescence properties.

A prerequisite for observing macroscopic mechanical coherence is to cool the mechanical resonators to their ground state. Here we propose a theoretical scheme to cool two coupled mechanical resonators by introducing an optomechanical interface. The final mean phonon numbers in the two mechanical resonators are calculated exactly and the results show that the ground-state cooling is achievable in the resolved-sideband regime and under the optimal driving. By adiabatically eliminating the cavity field in the large-decay regime, we obtain analytical results of the cooling limits, which show the smallest achievable phonon numbers and the parameter conditions under which the optimal cooling is achieved. Finally, the scheme is extended to the cooling of a chain of coupled mechanical resonators.

Electrochemical reduction is a feasible ambient reaction to convert N-2 to NH3, while it needs efficient electrocatalysts for the N-2 reduction reaction (NRR) to meet the challenge associated with N-2 activation. In this Letter, we report on our recent experimental finding that the TiO2 nanosheets array on the Ti plate (TiO2/Ti) is effective for electrochemical N-2 conversion to NH3 at ambient conditions. When tested in 0.1 M Na2SO4, such TiO2/Ti attains a high NH3 yield of 9.16 x 10(-11) mol s(-1).cm(-2) with corresponding Faradaic efficiency of 2.50% at -0.7 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, outperforming most reported aqueous-based NRR electrocatalysts. It also shows excellent selectivity for NH3 formation with high electrochemical stability. The superior NRR activity is due to the enhanced adsorption and activation generated during electrochemical tests. of N-2 by oxygen vacancies in situ generated during electrochemical tests.

Recently, learning-based super-resolution methods, such as sparse coding and super-resolution convolution neural network, have achieved promising reconstruction results in scene images. However, these methods remain insufficient for recovering detailed information from low-resolution MR images due to the limited size of training dataset. Methods: To investigate the different edge responses using different convolution kernel sizes, this study employs a multi-scale fusion convolution network (MFCN) to perform super-resolution for MRI images. Unlike traditional convolution networks that simply stack several convolution layers, the proposed network is stacked by multi-scale fusion units (MFUs). Each MFU consists of a main path and some sub-paths and finally fuses all paths within the fusion layer. Results: We discussed our experimental network parameters setting using simulated data to achieve trade-offs between the reconstruction performance and computational efficiency. We also conducted super-resolution reconstruction experiments using real datasets of MR brain images and demonstrated that the proposed MFCN has achieved a remarkable improvement in recovering detailed information from MR images and outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Conclusions: We have proposed a multi-scale fusion convolution network based on MFUs which extracts different scales features to restore the detail information. The structure of the MFU is helpful for extracting multi-scale information and making full-use of prior knowledge from a few training samples to enhance the spatial resolution.

There are three ways for them to impact on the optical process in various materials. They can act as external perturbations, such as ferroelectric gating and piezoelectric strain, to tune the optical properties of the materials and devices. Second, ferroelectricity and piezoelectricity as innate attributes may exist in some optoelectronic materials, which can couple with other functional features (e.g., semiconductor transport, photoexcitation, and photovoltaics) in the materials giving rise to unprecedented device characteristics. The last way is artificially introducing optical functionalities into ferroelectric and piezoelectric materials and devices, which provides an opportunity for investigating the intriguing interplay between the parameters (e.g., electric field, temperature, and strain) and the introduced optical properties. Here, the tuning strategies, fundamental mechanisms, and recent progress in ferroelectric and piezoelectric effects modulating the optical properties of a wide spectrum of materials, including lanthanide-doped phosphors, quantum dots, 2D materials, wurtzite-type semiconductors, and hybrid perovskites, are presented. Finally, the future outlook and challenges of this exciting field are suggested.

The key indicator in the search is that the candidates have a 2D network composed of magnetic atoms and heavy atoms. From the 187,093 entries in the ICSD, the search identified 15 candidates whose magnetic order are then determined by first-principles calculations and Curie temperatures obtained by either analytical solution or Monte Carlo simulation of the 2D Ising model. For the 15 candidates, eight materials have ferromagnetic order including three known structural prototypes and the two 2DFM materials discovered in recent experiments. More importantly, the search produced two new structural prototypes and a very promising material, Cr3Te4, which has a calculated Curie temperature one order of magnitude higher than the others.

The metamaterial absorber consists of two sizes of graphene disks and a gold film separated by a dielectric spacer in a unit cell. The numerical results demonstrate that the dual-band perfect absorption can be achieved by the superposition of the specific absorption peaks induced by different disks. The resonance frequency can be tuned via controlling the graphene conductivity and the sizes of the disks. The metamaterial absorber can achieve selectively frequency tunability and it can tune each resonance independently. And the dual-band absorption will not be changed when the small disks move along the diagonal within the range of our research. In addition, owing to the symmetry of the structure, the absorber is insensitive to polarization and can keep a high absorptivity with a wide angle. The flexible and simple design makes it possible for our proposed single-layer graphene absorber to be applied in many metamaterial fields, such as sensing, detecting, and cloaking objects.

However, studies on the effect of the practical application of this technique on different topographic aspects have been rarely performed. In this study, two topographic aspects, namely, north-facing versus south-facing, were investigated under two railway lines, and two local natural slopes (north-facing versus south-facing) were selected as references. Vegetation and soil conditions, which are paramount aspects of ecological restoration assessment, were characterized in terms of the richness and diversity indices, vegetation canopy cover, basic soil physico-chemical properties, and structural characteristics of these slopes. Results showed that (1) the topographic aspect significantly affected the vegetation restoration and artificial soil quality of rock-cut slopes restored by ESSS; (2) the ecological restoration effect of north facing slopes were better than that of south-facing slopes; and (3) the vegetation and soil conditions of natural slopes were better than those of rock-cut slopes. Therefore, additional scientific management measures should be implemented to promote the ecological restoration of rock-cut slopes, especially for south-facing slopes.

In this communication, we report the development of a Mo2N nanorod as a highly efficient and selective NRR electrocatalyst for artificial N-2 fixation in acidic electrolytes under ambient conditions. In 0.1 M HCl, this catalyst achieved a high Faradaic efficiency of 4.5% with a NH3 yield of 78.4 mu g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1) at -0.3 V vs. a reversible hydrogen electrode, thus outperforming most reported NRR electrocatalysts under ambient conditions and some under harsh conditions. Density functional theory calculations revealed that the free energy barrier of the potential determining step of NRR on MoO2 decreases dramatically after nitrogenization.

Here, we develop an adsorption-low temperature pyrolysis method for facilely preparing uniformly dispersed Ru nanoparticles on carbon (Ru/C) with an outstanding catalytic property toward hydrogen generation from both electrochemical water splitting and AB hydrolysis. The experimental results indicate that the Ru/C synthesized by calcination at 300 degrees C (Ru/C-300) exhibits the highest catalytic activity for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in basic solution, which requires an overpotential of only 14 mV at 10 mA cm(-2). Additionally, this catalyst also displays high activity and reusability toward hydrogen evolution through AB hydrolysis, leading to a high turnover frequency of 643 mol H-2 (min mol(Ru))(-1). Moreover, the Ru/C-300 shows excellent stability and reusability for both reactions. The adsorption-low temperature calcination strategy ensures that the small Ru nanoparticles are confined onto the carbon matrix, which can provide abundant highly reactive surface sites. It is discovered that the excellent catalytic activity of Ru/C depends largely on the size and dispersion of Ru nanoparticles as well as on their chemical states. This work may provide a facile and environmentally friendly strategy for preparing uniformly distributed metal nanocatalysts with high catalytic efficiencies for HER and AB hydrolysis.

The linear dispersion near the Weyl nodes and the anomalous broadening of the impurity level lead to a nonvanishing magnetic moment in a wide region of parameters. The magnetic susceptibility is significantly enhanced by increasing the chirality imbalance for the chemical potential fixed at the Weyl nodes. The Kondo effect takes place whenever the chemical potential is tuned away from the nodes. The low-temperature susceptibility is determined by both the Kondo screening and the broadening of the magnetic impurity level. In the presence of chiral anomaly, the Kondo screening displays opposite behaviors for the chemical potential situated below and above the Weyl nodes. The magnetic susceptibility can be tuned by the charge imbalance of the nodes, which provides a scheme to study the chiral anomaly in Weyl SMs.	[Li, Lin] Sichuan Normal Univ, Coll Phys & Elect Engn, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin] Sichuan Normal Univ, Ctr Computat Sci, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin; Wang, Zhen-Hua; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Shenzhen Inst Quantum Sci & Engn, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Li, Lin; Wang, Zhen-Hua; Chen, Wei-Qiang] Southern Univ Sci & Technol, Dept Phys, Shenzhen 518055, Peoples R China; [Sun, Jin-Hua] Ningbo Univ, Dept Phys, Ningbo 315211, Zhejiang, Peoples R China; [Wang, Zhen-Hua; Luo, Hong-Gang] Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China; [Xu, Dong-Hui] Hubei Univ, Dept Phys, Wuhan 430062, Hubei, Peoples R China; [Luo, Hong-Gang] Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China; [Luo, Hong-Gang] Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Magnetism & Magnet Mat, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China	Luo, HG (reprint author), Beijing Computat Sci Res Ctr, Beijing 100084, Peoples R China.; Luo, HG (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Ctr Interdisciplinary Studies, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.; Luo, HG (reprint author), Lanzhou Univ, Key Lab Magnetism & Magnet Mat, Minist Educ, Lanzhou 730000, Gansu, Peoples R China.	luohg@lzu.edu.cn; chen.wq@sustc.edu.cn	Xu, Dong-Hui/M-1912-2013; Luo, Hong-Gang/A-5842-2013; CHEN, Weiqiang/D-3058-2009	Xu, Dong-Hui/0000-0002-8307-3613; Luo, Hong-Gang/0000-0003-2602-4070; CHEN, Weiqiang/0000-0001-6740-6628	National Key Research and Development Program of China [2016YFA0300300]; NSFC of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11604138, 11674151, 11604166, 11704106, 11547110, 11674139]; PCSIRT of ChinaProgram for Changjiang Scholars & Innovative Research Team in University (PCSIRT) [IRT-16R35]; Scientific Research Project of Education Department of Hubei Province [Q20171005]	We acknowledge useful discussion with Rui Chen, Hua Chen, Wei Chen, and Hao-Ran Chang.

In this study, a highly efficient fluorescence chemosensor for Zn-II was developed from N-Boc-L-proline modified 1,8-naphthyridine. The fluorescence intensity of the chemosensor was increased significantly only in the presence of Zn-II ion which provided a perceived color change for rapid visual sensing, while other metal ions showed fluorescence quenching or little changes. It was worth noting that the chemosensor L distinguished Zn-II from Cd-II commonly having similar properties. The solvent effect and possible bonding mode for fluorescence enhancement have been also discussed. Results of this study indicated that the Boc-group in L-proline significantly improved the sensitivity and selectivity for Zn-II detection performance, as confirmed by comparison experiments and time dependent-density functional theory (TD-DFT) calculations.

The much less reported nematic-containing discotic materials have however been recently found to be of industrial importance too. In this context, highly conjugated fluorene-bridged triphenylene triads have been designed with the aim of inducing room temperature nematic phases. In our approach, the length of the alkyl chains bore by the central fluorene unit was changed in order to constrain the space-filling, to modulate the intermolecular pi-pi interactions, and to control the tendency of the molecular triads to stack into columns, and the subsequent aggregation of the columns in specific ways. This strategy was successful, and in addition to the naturally expected two-dimensional columnar mesophases, most triads exhibit the more elusive columnar nematic phase, as only the orientational-type long-range order is preserved. Photoluminescence, measured in both solution and thin films, revealed strong blue emission, characteristic of the fluorene moiety, with impressively high quantum efficiency. Charge carrier mobility measurements revealed novel p-type molecular semiconductors with hole transport mobility in the range of 0.2-2 x 10(-3)cm(2) V(-1 )s(-1) in the mesophases (Col(rec), Col(hex), and N-col) and up to 5 X 10(-4) cm(2 )V(-1)s(-1) in the isotropic phase. Reasons for the occurrence of these mesophases and their supramolecular structures are discussed along with the effects on the semiconducting properties.

Compounds 1 and 2 crystallize in the centrosymmetric space groups Pnma and C2/c, and compound 3 crystallizes in the noncentrosymmetric space groups Pn, respectively. All the three titled compounds exhibited three-dimensional (3-D) frameworks with a parallel arrangement of B(OH)(3) and HCOO planar pi-conjugated units through hydrogen bonding assisted construction. Particularly, compounds 2 and 3 showed a graphite-like layer structure. In compound 1, the Na(COOH)[B(OH)(3)] chains are connected with water molecules by hydrogen bonding to form the 3-D framework. In 2, graphite-like {(COOH)(3)[B(OH)(3)](2)}(3-) layers composed of HCOO and B(OH)(3) groups construct the 3-D framework through the bridging of charge-balance cations K+ located at the interlayer space. Compound 3 exhibits a 3-D framework through the lattice water molecules and graphite-like (HCOOH)(3)[B(OH)(3)](2) layers interconnecting with each other via hydrogen bonding. By further comparison, the size of Na+, K+ cations and water molecules brought the discrepancy and affected the framework structure and centricity of the three titled compounds. Second harmonic generation (SHG) studies indicated that compound 3 has moderate SHG responses of approximately 0.7 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP). The UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy of the powder samples indicated that the short-wavelength absorption edges of all three compounds were below 200 nm, and they are potential deep-UV optical materials.

A pristine AGNR system is metallic when the transverse layer m = 3j + 2 with a positive integer j and an insulator otherwise. When stubs are present, a semiconducting AGNR junction with width W (1) = 40 always shows metallic behavior regardless of the potential drop magnitude, magnetization strength, stub length, and perpendicular magnetic field strength. However, metallic or semiconducting behavior can be obtained from a metallic AGNR junction with W (1) = 41 by adjusting these physical parameters. Furthermore, a metal-to-semiconductor transition can be obtained for both superlattice p-n junctions by adjusting the number of periods of the superlattice. In addition, the spin-dependent Seebeck coefficient and spin Seebeck coefficient of the two systems are of the same order of magnitude owing to the appearance of a transmission gap, and the maximum absolute value of the spin Seebeck coefficient reaches 370 A mu V/K when the optimized parameters are used. The calculated results offer new possibilities for designing electronic or heat-spintronic nanodevices based on the graphene superlattice p-n junction.

However, D. dcne leaves from these three species are usually used confusingly, which could influence the therapeutic effect of it. A rapid and effective method for the chemical fingerprint and quantitative analysis to evaluate the quality of D. dcne leaves was established. The chemometric methods, including similarity analysis, hierarchical cluster analysis and partial least-squares discrimination analysis, were applied to distinguish 30 batches of D. dcne leaf samples from these three species. The above results could validate each other and successfully group these samples into three categories which were closely related to the species of D. dcne leaves. Moreover, isoquercitrin and phlorizin were screened as the chemical markers to evaluate the quality of D. dcne leaves from different species. And the contents of isoquercitrin and phlorizin varied remarkably in these samples, with ranges of 6.41-38.84 and 95.73-217.76mg/g, respectively. All the results indicated that an integration method of chemical fingerprint couple with chemometrics analysis and quantitative assessment was a powerful and beneficial tool for quality control of D. dcne leaves, and could be applied also for differentiation and quality control of other herbal preparations.

X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscope (SEM), photoluminescence excitation and emission spectra (PL) and photoluminescence decay curves were used to characterize La2-xEuxMo2O9 samples. The effects of the Eu3+ ions concentration on the luminescence of the La2-xEuxMo2O9 microcrystals were also investigated in detail. The results show that the obtained La2-xEuxMo2O9 microcrystals are cubic phase continuous solid solution, and all can be efficiently excited by 335 nm ultraviolet and 464 nm blue light, exhibiting the strong red emission at 615 nm of Eu3+ ion. The obtained La2-xEuxMo2O9 microcrystals are promising red-emitting phosphors pumped by near-UV or blue light for the white light emitting diodes (WLEDs).

In this study, we investigate the change pattern between authenticity and calling. Specifically, we conducted a three-wave longitudinal study with 459 Chinese university students over one year and examined the reciprocal dynamic relation between authenticity (i.e., authentic living, self-alienation, and accepting external influence) and calling. Results of a bivariate latent change score model examining within-individual changes over time showed that increases in authentic living were positively correlated with increases in calling, while increases in self-alienation and accepting external influence negatively correlated with increases in calling. We also found that higher levels of authentic living significantly predicted an increase in calling over time. However, higher levels of calling predicted a decrease in authentic living. Our findings contribute to the literature on calling by suggesting a dynamic change pattern of authenticity and calling among Chinese university students.

This means that Alice can transmit an unknown single-qubit unitary operation U-A on the remote Bob's quantum system; and at the same time, Bob can also transmit an arbitrary single-qubit unitary operation U-B on Alice's quantum system. In this paper, we present three BQOT schemes via different quantum channels. Furthermore, using these quantum channels, we investigate the BQOT in noisy environments, such as phasedamping noise and amplitude-damping noise. We considered the influence of the noises on the process of these three BQOT protocols through analytical derivation of the fidelity. Moreover, these three schemes are amply compared with each other from five aspects, i.e. quantum resource consumption, operation complexity, classical resource consumption, success probability and efficiency. It is found that these schemes can be realized deterministically and the first scheme is better than the other two schemes.

To investigate the angle of attack between blood flow and mitral valve leaflets at pre-SAM time point, patient-specific CT-based computational models were constructed for 5 patients receiving septal myectomy surgery to obtain pre- and post-operative 2D vector flow mapping. The comparisons between pre- and post-operative angles of attack based on 2D vector flow mapping of 5 patients were performed. It was found that there was no statistically significant difference between pre- and post-operative angles of attack (61.1 +/- t wa degrees vs. 56.2 +/- 56.degrees, p=0.306, n=5). Therefore, we propose that the angle of attack might not play an important role in the initiation of SAM.

However, the ease of formation of surface oxide or patina layer raises difficulty of storage and handling of copper powder, particularly in the case of Cu microparticles. Here, we developed a thermal chemical vapor deposition chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process for large-scale synthesis of graphene coatings on Cu microparticles, which importantly can remain monodisperse without aggregation after graphene growth at high temperature by using removal spacers. Compared to other protective coating methods, the intrinsic electrical and thermal properties of Cu powder would not be degraded by uniform growth of low defect few-layer graphene on each particle surface. As a result, when the anticorrosion performance test was carried out by immersing the samples in Cu etchant, the corrosion rate of graphene/ Cu microparticles was significantly improved (ca three times slower) compared to that of pristine Cu powder, also showing a comparable anticorrosion ability to commercial CuZn30 alloy.

Dysosma versipellis (Hance) M. Cheng is an endangered species endemic to China, and a highly valued medicinal and ornamental plant. In this study, we discuss the effects of different light spectrums conferred by colored plastic films on photosynthesis and the contents of active ingredients of D. versipellis. D. versipellis plants were cultured for 90 days under white, red, yellow, or blue film. The blue film treatment generally increased the chlorophyll content, photosynthetic rate (Pn), maximal photochemical efficiency of PSII (F (v) /F (m) ), actual photochemical efficiency of PSII (D<PSII), photochemical quenching (qP), and the podophyllotoxin content of the rhizomes. The blue film treatment also decreased the maximum net photosynthetic rate (Amax), apparent photosynthetic quantum efficiency (AQY), and podophyllotoxin contents of the stems. The yellow film treatment resulted in a decline of the Amax, AQY, F (v) /F (m) , DPSII, qP, chlorophyll contents, and podophyllotoxin contents of the leaves and rhizomes; however, the light compensation point (LCP), light saturation point, and minimum fluorescence (F (o) ) were increased. There were no significant differences in chlorophyll content, Amax, LCP, AQY, F (v) /F (m) , DPSII, or qP between the white and red film treatments. These results suggest that in D. versipellis, blue film treatments promote photosynthesis and the accumulation of podophyllotoxin, while yellow film treatments inhibit photosynthesis and the accumulation of podophyllotoxin.

There are many profound results about this type of lattices, the most recent one of which, due to Cz,dli and Schimdt (Adv Math 225:2455-2463, 2010), says that a lattice L of finite length is semimodular if and only if L has a cover-preserving embedding into a geometric lattice G of the same length. The goal of our paper is to offer the following result: a lattice of finite length is semimodular if and only if every cell in L is a 4-element Boolean lattice and the 7-element non-distributive atomistic lattice having 3 atoms is not a cover-preserving sublattice of L.

Both late tumor diagnosis and tolerance to available chemical therapy increase patient mortality. Therefore, it is both urgent and important to identify biomarkers facilitating early identification and novel agents preventing recurrence. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that epigenetic aberrations (particularly histone modifications) are crucial in tumor initiation and development. Histone acetylation and methylation are respectively regulated by acetyltransferases-deacetylases and methyltransferases-demethylases, both of which are implicated in ovarian cancer pathogenesis. In this review, we summarize the most recent discoveries pertaining to ovarian cancer development arising from the imbalance of histone acetylation and methylation, and provide insight into novel therapeutic interventions for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma.

The double bowtie aperture, composing of four triangle-hollow areas and a square-hollow area, can concentrate light into deep-subwavelength volumes with the enhanced field. And Ag layers, respectively located onto and beneath photoresist layer, can enhance light transmission and compensate transmission loss. This advantage aforementioned contributes to prolong light transmission distance. With COMSOL simulation, we discuss the influences of the novel lithography structure parameters on the quality of spots, and the simulation results demonstrate that sub-45-nm (lambda/8) spots are obtained under optimal values.

Herein, a multidimensional N-doped porous carbon/MoS2/CNT (FSC/MoS2/CNT) nano-architecture hybrid is rationally designed and successfully fabricated by the facile pyrolysis and hydrothermal processes. For the nano-architecture composite, the porous carbon embedded with electroconductive acid-treated CNTs effectively enhances the flexibility and constructs a conductive network for rapid ion/electron transfer; specifically, a synergistic action of polar MoS2 and electronegative doped N atoms significantly strengthens the chemical affinity with polysulfides; furthermore, MoS2 exhibits a strong catalytic effect that can improve the redox kinetics of polysulfides. On account of the merits mentioned above, the as-built N-doped porous carbon/MoS2/CNTs@S (FSC/MoS2/CNTs@S) composite, utilized as the Li-S battery cathode, delivers a high discharge capacity of 1313.4 mA h g(-1) at 0.1C, glorious rate performance with 671.6 mA h g(-1) at 2.0C and remarkable cycling stability with a capacity fading rate of 0.059% per cycle for 500 cycles at 1.0C. This work provides a novel and simple strategy to design a CNT decorated polar and conductive hybrid network of doped porous carbon/transition metal sulfide for application in excellent performance Li-S batteries and numerous energy storage fields.

Electrochemical reduction offers a carbon-neutral process to convert N-2 to NH3 at ambient conditions, but requires efficient and stable catalysts for the N-2 reduction reaction. Mo-dependent nitrogenases and synthetic molecular complexes have attracted increasing attention for N-2 fixation; however, less attention has been paid to Mo-based nanocatalysts for electrochemical N-2 conversion to NH3. Herein, we report that MoO3 nanosheets act as an efficient non-noble-metal catalyst for electrochemical N-2 fixation to NH3 with excellent selectivity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. In 0.1 M HCl, this catalyst exhibits remarkable NRR activity with an NH3 yield of 4.80 x 10(-10) mol s(-1) cm(-2) (29.43 g h(-1) mg(cat.)(-1)) and a faradaic efficiency of 1.9%. Moreover, this catalyst also shows high electrochemical stability and durability. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the outermost Mo atoms serve as the active sites for effective N-2 adsorption.

Herein we presented a 5-methylbenzotriazole modified graphene oxide (MBTA-GO) as a novel adsorbent, in which benzotriazole group was used as targeted sorption site bearing strong affinity toward An-Ln (An and Ln) ions for the first time. MBTA-GO was characterized by Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The effect of pH and initial concentration on combined adsorption of An-Ln were examined, and the results showed that the adsorption of metal ions on MBTA-GO was strongly dependent on pH in multi-cation solution, and MBTA-GO exhibited excellent An-Ln selectivity (selectivity coefficients are more than 99%), overwhelming majority of other reported adsorbents. The cycle experiments revealed that the MBTA-GO exhibited good reusability and structural stability. By density functional theory (DFT) calculation, the binding energy of Cation-MBTA-GO followed the order of Th(IV) > U(VI) > Eu(III) > La(III) > Sr(II) > Cs(I), suggesting that the benzotriazole groups were preferentially responsible for An-Ln ions on MBTA-GO, which is in well agreement with the experimental results. Finally, the mechanism of selective coadsorption was revealed, which is the synergistic effect of chemical complexation and electrostatic interaction.

In this communication, we report that Fe-doped CoP nanosheet arrays on nickel foam (Fe-0.33-CoP/NF) act as a highly active bifunctional electrocatalyst for both the oxygen reduction reaction and the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. We further demonstrate the use of Fe-0.33-CoP/NF as the cathode to construct rechargeable ZABs with superior performance to that of the CoP/NF counterpart. In concentrated alkaline electrolytes, such ZABs exhibit a higher power density of 63 mW cm(-2) than that of CoP/NF (23 mW cm(-2)) with a long cycle life (up to 200 h).

Herein, a facile assembly of graphene oxide and porous carbon is reported to fabricate the inherent nitrogen-doped porous carbon and graphene composited nanostructures. When used as the sulfur scaffold for lithium sulfur batteries, the materials suggest outstanding electrochemical properties, including a high reversible capacity (1372mAh g(-1) at 0.1C), excellent rate performance (451 mAh g(-1) at 3C) and cycling stability (579 mAh g(-1) at 1C after 500 cycles). The enhancement in electrochemical properties can be ascribed to the 3D hierarchical porous structure of the carbon hybrid, in which, besides, the inherent doping of nitrogen can generate homogeneous active sites and defects that can effectively improve the interfacial adsorption. Thus, the simple strategy of pyrolysis and self assembly of graphene oxide and porous carbon provided in this work opens a new avenue for combining different dimensional nanocarbons to construct nitrogen-doped, multi-dimensional carbon architecture for high performance lithium sulfur batteries.

Cross-Kerr effect in a parity-time symmetric optomechanical system	OPTICS EXPRESS			English	Article							ELECTROMAGNETICALLY INDUCED TRANSPARENCY; QUANTUM GROUND-STATE; CAVITY OPTOMECHANICS; SLOW LIGHT	The cross-Kerr effects between the cavity and the mechanical oscillator in a parity-time symmetric optomechanical system are investigated. It is found that in the double-passive case there appears an asymmetric optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT) spectrum which is composed of a broad absorption peak located around the resonant point and a absorption line at the frequency position mainly determined by the Kerr interaction. The distinctive asymmetry induced by the cross-Kerr coupling is precisely demonstrated by the analytic findings. In the passive-active case, the resonance peaks in the OMIT spectrum are increased with the weak tunnel coupling, which is contrary to that in the double-passive case. When the tunnel coupling is increased up in the strong coupling region, the broad absorption peak and the absorption line in the OMIT spectrum are sequentially changed into the amplification ones, and the central amplification dip is split into two parts due to the normal mode splitting induced by the strong tunnel coupling. This can be used to realize a switching from absorption to amplification by only adjusting the tunnel interaction.

We note that existing studies do not treat different sensors in the network discriminatively and consider only how to charge as many sensors as possible before their energy expirations. However, there are some critical sensors in the network, so that many other sensors have no alternative routing paths to upload their sensing data to the base station if the critical sensors die. Therefore, the energy expiration of a critical sensor will result in that not only the sensor itself cannot continue its monitoring task, but also many other sensors cannot send their data during the dead period of the critical sensor. Then, the monitoring quality of the sensor network will significantly deteriorate due to the energy expirations of the critical sensor. Unlike existing studies, we take into account the impact of energy depletions of critical sensors and investigate a charging scheduling problem for sensor networks, which is to schedule a charging vehicle to replenish a set of to-be-charged sensors, such that not only the amount of lost data by dead sensors is minimized, but also the traveling cost of the vehicle for charging sensors is minimized, too. We then propose a novel algorithm for the problem. We finally compare the proposed algorithm with existing studies and simulation results show that the amount of lost data by the proposed algorithm is only about 50% of those by the existing studies, and the weighted sum of the amount of lost data and the vehicle travel distance is about 70% of those by the existing ones.

They are widely regarded as building blocks for next-generation magnetic storage. The main advantage of skyrmions lies in their particular dynamic behaviors, especially in their ability to move stably in racetrack under the action of small spin-polarized currents. The writing, driving and reading methods of skyrmions in racetrack are reviewed in detail in this paper, including the most recent research findings. The review focuses on the most commonly used driving method, i.e., driving skyrmions by applying spin-polarized currents. The clogging and annihilation of skyrmions in racetrack are analyzed, with the skyrmion Hall effect discussed which may lead skyrmion signals to lose. Methods to avoid skyrmion Hall effect are introduced and hence the optimized designs for skyrmion-based racetrack are also reviewed. Finally, some challenges of skyrmion-based racetrack memory are discussed.

Herein, uniformly dispersed and size-controllable iridium (Ir) nanoparticles (NPs) were prepared using a nitrogen-functionalized carbon as the support (Ir/CN). We found that nitrogen functionalization can simultaneously modulate the size of Ir NPs to substantially enhance the catalytically active sites and adjust the electronic structure of Ir, thereby promoting electrocatalytic activity for water splitting. Consequently, the as-synthesized Ir/CN shows excellent electrocatalytic performance with overpotentials of 12 and 265 mV for hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions in basic medium, respectively. These findings may pave the way for designing and synthesizing other similar materials as efficient catalysts for electrochemical water splitting.

Anti-inflammatory phenotype (M2) macrophages promote vessel maturation and tissue regeneration. Biomaterials which can promote M2 polarisation after appropriate inflammation should enhance angiogenesis and wound healing. Herein, Interleukin-4 (IL-4), an anti-inflammatory cytokine, was adsorbed onto a titanium surface. Then, a genipin cross-linked gelatine hydrogel was coated onto the surface to delay IL-4 release. The cross-linking degree of the hydrogel was modulated by the different amount of genipin to control release of IL-4. When 0.7 wt% (weight %) genipin was used as a cross-linker, the sample (GG07-I) released less IL-4 within the first several days, followed by a sustained release time to 14 d. Meanwhile, the release rate of IL-4 in GG07-I reached a peak between 3 d and 7 d. In culture with macrophages in vitro, GG07-I and GG07 exhibited good cytocompatibility. The phenotypical switch of macrophages stimulated by the samples was determined by FACS, ELISA and PCR. Macrophages cultured with GG07-I, GG07 and PT were firstly activated to the M1 phenotype by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). Then, due to the release of IL-4 in 5 to 7 d, GG07-I enhanced CD206, increased the secretion and gene expression of M2 marker, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10), arginase-1 (ARG-1) and platelet derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB). GG07-I prompted the switch from M1 to M2 phenotype. Those appropriate secretion of cytokines would benefit both vascularisation and osseointegration. Thus, the biomaterial directing inflammatory reaction has good prospects for clinical treatments.	[Yang, C. L.; Sun, Y. H.; Yin, X.

Herein, an indirect Z-scheme photocatalyst of Ag nanoparticles and polymer polypyrrole (PPy) co-modified BiOBr was rationally designed and successfully synthesized via a combination of hydrothermal technique, in-situ photo-reduction and oxidative polymerization method. Dramatically, BiOBr-Ag-PPy system showed superior photocatalytic performance and excellent stability in degradation of both the typical triphenylmethane dye (malachite green) and colorless organic compound (phenol). Especially for BAP-0.4, its degradation conversion of malachite green was 6.4, 2.4 and 1.6 times of those of pure BiOBr, BiOBr-Ag and BiOBr-PPy, respectively, and can still maintain more than 91% even after fifth cycle experiment. The trapping experiments of reactive species and electron spin resonance (ESR) tests confirmed that the O-center dot(2) and h(+) were main active species in photocatalytic degradation. Through experimental investigations and theoretical analyses, the possible charge carriers transfer process over BiOBr-Ag-PPy ternary Z-scheme photocatalyst was proposed. In the indirect all-solid-state Z-scheme BiOBr-Ag-PPy heterojunction structure, by quenching the photo-generated electrons and holes with weaker redox ability in metal Ag nanoparticles, the electrons in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of PPy and holes in the valence band (VB) of BiOBr can survive and then have the opportunity to participate in the surface reaction, thus showing an increased photocatalytic activity.

It was postulated that clonal integration could exhibit positive effects on nitrogen cycling in the rhizosphere of clonal plant subjected to heterogeneous light conditions. An in-situ experiment was conducted using clonal fragments of Phyllostachys bissetii with two successive ramets. Shading treatments were applied to offspring or mother ramets, respectively, whereas counterparts were treated to full sunlight. Rhizomes between two successive ramets were either severed or connected. Extracellular enzyme activities and nitrogen turnover were measured, as well as soil properties. Abundance of functional genes (archaeal or bacterial amoA, nifH) in the rhizosphere of shaded, offspring or mother ramets were determined using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Carbon or nitrogen availabilities were significantly influenced by clonal integration in the rhizosphere of shaded ramets. Clonal integration significantly increased extracellular enzyme activities and abundance of functional genes in the rhizosphere of shaded ramets. When rhizomes were connected, higher nitrogen turnover (nitrogen mineralization or nitrification rates) was exhibited in the rhizosphere of shaded offspring ramets. However, nitrogen turnover was significantly decreased by clonal integration in the rhizosphere of shaded mother ramets. Path analysis indicated that nitrogen turnover in the rhizosphere of shaded, offspring or mother ramets were primarily driven by the response of soil microorganisms to dissolved organic carbon or nitrogen. This unique in-situ experiment provided insights into the mechanism of nutrient recycling mediated by clonal integration. It was suggested that effects of clonal integration on the rhizosphere microbial processes were dependent on direction of photosynthates transport in clonal plant subjected to heterogeneous light conditions.

Due to the low contrast of the image and fuzziness of gray level distribution, the high-precision maximum fuzzy correlation method can take place of existing maximum fuzzy entropy method to segment infrared ship, since it can measure the appropriateness of the fuzzy segmentation better. Nevertheless, the maximum fuzzy correlation segmentation is computationally expensive. Straightforward implementation of maximum fuzzy correlation segmentation on infrared ship images may obtain incomplete segmentation results, since spatial coherence is not enforced. For addressing that, the image enhancement technique based on fuzzy sure entropy is used before the segmentation to alleviate the low-contrast problem. Then the fuzzy correlation model with three-parameter membership function is used to segment infrared ship images. For reducing the computational cost, an iterative calculation strategy is proposed for eliminating the repeated computation. Finally, the probabilities of fuzzy events obtained from maximum fuzzy correlation are used to set the data terms of graph cut for getting the spatial coherent segmentation results. Quantitative evaluations over 80 low-contrast infrared ship images demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively segment infrared ship targets and outperform several existing segmentation methods in terms of precision and efficiency.

This leads to a great waste of energy since in practice traffic rarely ever hits peak capacity resulting in the links being under-utilized most of the time. Furthermore, the traditional non-traffic-aware routing mechanisms worsen the situation. From the perspective of resource allocation and routing, this paper aims to implement a green data center network and save as much energy as possible. With the benefit of blocking island paradigm, we present a general framework trying to maximize the network power conservation and minimize sacrifices of network performance and reliability. The bandwidth allocation mechanism together with power-aware routing algorithm achieve a bandwidth guaranteed green tighter network. Moreover, our fast efficient heuristics for allocating bandwidth enable the system to scale to large sized data centers. The evaluation result shows that achieving up to more than 50 percent power savings are feasible while guaranteeing network performance and reliability.

Visitors' perceptions of poor tourist-resident relationships and conditions of safety may have an impact on their attitudes, especially with regard to trip satisfaction. This study investigates the roles of tourist-resident relationship and safety perception on the relationship between service quality, trip satisfaction, and word of mouth (WOM). The results of this empirical study (n = 386) show that the tourist-resident relationship and safety perception have significant effects on trip satisfaction, but only safety perception reveals a significant effect on WOM. Furthermore, the results also indicate that the tourist-resident relationship and safety perception moderate the relationship between service quality and trip satisfaction, and that the tourist-resident relationship also moderates the relationship between trip satisfaction and WOM. An understanding of these mechanisms can help governments to create appropriate policies to support the sustainable development of tourism and promote their tourism industries by fostering tourists' WOM.

However, an integrated understanding of the debris-free and debris-covered glacier evolution and its interaction with glacial lake is still lacking. Using one case study in the Gyirong River Basin located in the central Himalayas, this paper applied archival Landsat imagery and an automated mapping method to understand how glaciers and glacial lakes interactively evolved between 1988 and 2015. Our analyses identified 467 glaciers in 1988, containing 435 debris-free and 32 debris-covered glaciers, with a total area of 614.09 +/- 36.69 km(2). These glaciers decreased by 16.45% in area from 1988 to 2015, with an accelerated retreat rate after 1994. Debris-free glaciers retreated faster than debris-covered glaciers. As a result of glacial downwasting, supraglacial debris coverage expanded upward by 17.79 km2 (24.44%). Concurrent with glacial retreat, glacial lakes increased in both number (+41) and area (+54.11%). Glacier-connected lakes likely accelerated the glacial retreat via thermal energy transmission and contributed to over 15% of the area loss in their connected glaciers. On the other hand, significant glacial retreats led to disconnections from their proglacial lakes, which appeared to stabilize the lake areas. Continuous expansions in the lakes connected with debris-covered glaciers, therefore, need additional attention due to their potential outbursts. In comparison with precipitation variation, temperature increase was the primary driver of such glacier and glacial lake changes. In addition, debris coverage, size, altitude, and connectivity with glacial lakes also affected the degree of glacial changes and resulted in the spatial heterogeneity of glacial wastage across the Gyirong River Basin.

The obtained equilibrium structure parameters and ground-state mechanical properties were in excellent agreement with the other theoretical results. The calculated elastic constants and phonon dispersion spectra show that Cmcm-HfB4 is mechanically and dynamically stable up to 100 GPa and no phase transition was observed. An analysis of the elastic modulus indicates that Crucm-HfB4 possesses a large bulk modulus, shear modulus and Young's modulus. The superior mechanical properties identify this compound as a possible candidate for a superhard material. Further hardness calculation confirmed that this compound is a superhard material with high hardness (45.5 GPa for GGA); and the relatively strong B-B covalent bonds' interaction and the planar six-membered ring boron network in Cmcm-HfB4 are crucial for the high hardness. Additionally - , the pressure-induced elastic anisotropy behaviour has been analysed by several different anisotropic indexes. By calculating the B/G and Poisson's ratio, it is predicted that Cmcm-HfB4 possesses brittle behaviour in the range of pressure from 0 to 100 GPa, and higher pressures can reduce its brittleness. Finally, the thermodynamic properties, including enthalpy (Delta H), free energy (Delta G), entropy (Delta S), heat capacity (C-V) and Debye temperature (Theta(D)) are obtained under pressure and temperature, and the results are also interpreted.

A presag compensation strategy is introduced to lock the instantaneous magnitudes and phase angles of real-time line voltages, and thus to compensate the improper voltage components exactly after symmetrical or asymmetrical voltage disturbances. A 0.3-H/1.76-kA superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) magnet is used to cooperate with conventional battery energy storage (BES) device for developing a high-performance hybrid energy storage (HES) system. In the SMES-BES HES-based DVR system, the SMES can compensate the worst voltage sag for five cycles (1 MW, 100 ms, and absorb the highest voltage swell for six cycles (1 MW, 120 ms). The accessorial high-capacity BES device is subsequently discharged or charged for lasting longtime mitigation operations. Various simulation cases with regard to combined voltage sag, swell, and harmonic disturbances are carried out. The simulations and comparisons among the SMES-based, BES-based, and HES-based DVR schemes have demonstrated that the HES-based DVR scheme integrates the merits of fast response speed and high-power density from the SMES-based scheme, and the merits of low capital cost and high-energy density from the BES-based scheme.

The effect of ethanol volume ratio (R) on the microstructure and morphological evolution of the Tb-MOFs architectures has been systematically investigated. Interestingly, the blooming level of magnolia-like architectures increases with R values. A possible formation and evolution mechanism has been proposed. Moreover, the photoluminescence properties of the as-obtained Tb-MOFs architectures are discussed in detail. The result indicates that the emission intensity of the samples initially increased and then decreased with increasing R values. And, the samples synthesized at R = 0.3 with a blooming magnolia-like architectures have optimal luminescent properties and fluorescence lifetime owing to the fewer defect. Since its simplicity and low-cost, this developed synthetic route is promising for the controllable preparation of other functional micro/nano MOFs materials with improved properties.

Femtocells are widely recognized as a promising technology to address these demands. As femtocells are sold or loaned by a mobile network operator (MNO) to its residential or enterprise customers, MNOs usually employ refunding scheme to compensate the femtocell holders (FHs) providing indoor access to other subscribers by configuring the femtocell to operate in open or hybrid access mode. Due to the selfishness nature, competition between network operators as well as femtocell holders makes it challenging for operators to select appropriate FHs for trading access resources. This inspires us to develop an effective refunding framework, with aim to improve overall network resource utilization, through promoting FHs to make reasonable access permission for well-matched macro users. In this paper, we develop a two-stage auction-Stackelberg game (ASGF) framework for access permission in femtocell networks, where MNO and mobile virtual network operator lease access resources from multiple FHs. We first design an auction mechanism to determine the winner femtocell that fulfils the access request of macro users. We next formulate the access permission problem between the winner femtocell and operators as a Stackelberg game, and theoretically prove the existence of unique equilibrium. As a higher system payoff can be gained by improving individual players' payoff in the game, each player can choose the best response to others' action by implementing access permission, while avoiding solving a complicated optimization problem. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our proposed ASGF based refunding framework and the overall network efficiency can be improved significantly.

Zinc ferrite materials synthesized by various methods are usually reported to exhibit enhanced magnetism, but the mechanism underlying such enhancement remains poorly understood, with at least three effects being considered, namely cation distribution, oxygen vacancies, and surface spin disorder. We report herein the individual influence of cation distribution on the magnetic properties of zinc ferrite microparticles, synthesized by solid-state reaction with a fast (200 K/s) quench process. Based on structure analyses including x-ray powder diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Mossbauer spectroscopy, and magnetic measurements, it is concluded that the as-prepared samples exhibited different cation distribution with inversion degree increasing from approximately 0.18 to 0.28 with increasing calcination temperature from 800A degrees C to 1200A degrees C. The magnetism measured at 2 K was found to be enhanced with increase of the inversion degree, while that measured at 300 K was found to be independent of inversion degree. The mechanism of the enhanced magnetization is that the indirect interaction between A and B site at low temperature is stronger than that between two nearest B sites.

In this paper, the generalized Heronian mean operator and geometric Heronian mean operator under the q-rung orthopair fuzzy sets is studied. First, the q-rung orthopair fuzzy generalized Heronian mean (q-ROFGHM) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy geometric Heronian mean (q-ROFGHM) operator, q-rung orthopair fuzzy generalized weighted Heronian mean (q-ROFGWHM) operator, and q-rung orthopair fuzzy weighted geometric Heronian mean (q-ROFWGHM) operator are proposed, and some of their desirable properties are investigated in detail. Furthermore, we extend these operators to q-rung orthopair 2-tuple linguistic sets (q-RO2TLSs). Then, an approach to multiple attribute decision making based on q-ROFGWHM (q-ROFWGHM) operator is proposed. Finally, a practical example for enterprise resource planning system selection is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

By using an effective numerical quadrature rule based on boundary value method to discretize the integral term in the distributed-order derivative, the original distributed order differential equation is approximated by a multi-term time fractional sub-diffusion equation, which is then solved by a compact difference scheme. It is shown that the suggested compact difference scheme is stable and convergent in L-infinity norm with the convergence order O(tau(2) + h(4) + (Delta gamma)(P)) when a boundary value method of order p is used, where tau, h and Delta gamma are the step sizes in time, space and distributed-order variables, respectively. Numerical results are reported to verify the high order accuracy and efficiency of the suggested scheme. Moreover, in the example, comparisons between some existing methods and the suggested scheme is also provided, showing that our method doesn't compromise in computational time. (C) 2018 IMACS.

Each end-user is equipped with an optical matcher that exploits only the specific length patchcord and two different fiber Bragg gratings with 100% reflectivity. The simple and low-cost scheme can greatly simplify the final recognition processing of the network link status and reduce the sensitivity of the photodetector.

A porous binary metal oxide nanoarray integrated on a binder-free 3D electrode is expected to offer a highly sensitive sensing platform. As a model, porous NiCo2O4 nanowire arrays supported on carbon cloth (NiCo2O4 NWA/CC) have been prepared and used for enzyme-free glucose sensing. NiCo2O4 NWA/CC shows larger effective surface area, superior electronic conductivity, and higher catalytic activity towards enzyme-free glucose sensing, with a linear range from 1 mu M to 0.63 mM, a sensitivity of 4.12 mA mM-1 cm-2, and low detection limit of 0.5 mu M. Moreover, NiCo2O4 NWA/CC also displays good selectivity and stability and thus, it can be reliable for glucose detection in human serum samples. These findings inspire the fabrication of a high-performance electrochemical sensing platform by preparing porous binary metal oxide nanoarrays supported on a 3D conductive substrate.

However, conservation measures have been reported to increase soil resistance and decrease erosion. Hydraulic flume experiments were conducted to measure the detachment rate of disturbed soil samples from a peanut field with five tillage practices. Hydraulic variables were adopted to estimate the soil detachment rate and to quantify the rill erodibility parameter. The disturbed soil detachment rates are substantially greater than those for comparable undisturbed soil experiments. The average disturbed soil detachment rates for the 5 different tillage treatments, from lowest to highest, are as follows: straw mulch (PC) < manure (PM) < peanut and orange intercropping (PO) < peanut and radish crop rotation (PR) < conventional downslope furrows (PF). The conservation measures (PC, PM and PO) have a limited effect on increasing the disturbed soil resistance under low flow energy conditions. Thus, the average rill erodibility is lower, and the critical shear stress is higher for the PC, PM and PO treatments than those of the PR and PF treatments. With a slope gradient steeper than 17.6%, there is no significant difference among the detachment rates of all treatments. A linear function of both flow rate and slope gradient can be used to estimate the disturbed soil detachment rate. Both stream power and flow shear stress are more effective than the unit stream power in predicting soil detachment rates. The stream power is the most effective predictor among the three hydraulic parameters studied. Instead of the power functions, the linear functions of the hydraulic parameters are suggested to quantify the disturbed soil detachment rates.

A series of sodium-rare earth carbonates crystals NaGdCO3F2 (1), Na2GdCO3F3 (2), Na3Gd(CO3)(3) (3), and Na3Gd(CO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O (4) have been synthesized. NaGdCO3F2 (1) is composed of a three-dimensional (3-D) [GdCO3F2](-) framework with Na+ as the charge balance cation. Na2GdCO3F3 (2) showed two-dimensional (2-D) [GdCO3F3](2-) layers along the c-axis and further bridged by Na+ to form a 3-D framework. Na3Gd(CO3)(3) (3) is made up of alternately stacked layers [Na(CO3)(2)](infinity) along the a-axis and [Na2Gd(CO3)(2)](infinity) in the be plane, forming a 3-D framework. Na3Gd(CO3)(3)center dot 6H(2)O (4) exhibits an intricate 3-D structure composed of a [Gd(CO3)(3)(H2O)(3)](3-) complex and bridging Na+ ions. The results from the UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy study indicated that the short-wavelength absorption edge of all four compounds were below 200 nm, suggesting that they are potential deep-ultraviolet optical materials. Powder second harmonic generation measurements indicated that the compounds 3 and 4 are phase-matchable (type I), and they exhibit relatively strong second harmonic generation responses of approximately 3 and 2 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP).

Total connectedness reaches a peak when the system exhibits stress, especially during the recent period from mid 2014 to end-2016. Large commercial banks and insurers usually exhibit systemic importance, but some small firms are systemically important due to their high level of incoming (outgoing) connectedness. Our results provide useful information to regulators when they assess systemic risk of financial institutions and formulate macroprudential supervision policy. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

They are good alternatives to algebraic product and algebraic sum, respectively. Nevertheless, it seems that most of the existing hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators are based on the algebraic operations. In this paper, we utilize Hamacher operations to develop some Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy aggregation operators: Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted average (PHFHWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher weighted geometric (PHFHWG) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted average (PHFHOWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher ordered weighted geometric (PHFHOWG) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced ordered weighted average (PHFHIOWA) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced ordered weighted geometric (PHFHIOWG) operator, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher induced correlated aggregation operators, Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher prioritized aggregation operators, and Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy Hamacher power aggregation operators. The special cases of these proposed operators are studied. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the Pythagorean hesitant fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems. Finally, a practical example for green supplier selections in is given to verify the developed approach and to demonstrate its practicality and effectiveness.

It is found that the addition of CaSnO3 caused a series of phase transitions in the (1-x)BaTiO3-xCaSnO(3) ceramics, and a ferroelectric coexistence of rhombohedral, orthorhombic, and tetragonal phases is formed at x=0.08, where the ceramics exhibit the lowest energy barrier and consequently facilitate the polarization rotation and extension, resulting in the optimal piezoelectricity of d(33) and k(p) values of 550pC/N and 0.60, respectively. Our study provides an intuitive insight to understand the origin of high piezoelectricity in the ceramics with the coexistence of multiferroelectric phases.

The fluorescence sensor which was synthesized by one-pot approach shows dual-emissions at 470 nm (Ag NCs) and 630 nm (Au NCs) under a single excitation at 390 nm. In the presence of Hg2+, the red fluorescence of Au NCs was quenched while the fluorescence of Ag NCs almost unchanged, which exhibited a ratiometric fluorescence response and an obvious fluorescence color change toward Hg2+. The selective quenching mechanism may be due to the formation of gold amalgam bonds between Hg2+ (4f(14)5d(10)) and Au+ (4f(14)5d(10))A limit of detection (LOD) of 2.2 mu g L-1 and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 7) of 0.7% at a concentration of 50 mu g L-1 of Hg2+ were obtained when using a commercial fluorescence spectrophotometer as the detector. In visual detection, as low as 10 mu g L-1 of Hg2+ can be easily discriminated from the blank with the naked eye. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including simplicity, rapidity, ease of usage and high-sensitively. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

A simple, stable, and low-cost monitoring source with side mode suppression ratio of 47 dB that consists of a FP-LD, a polarization controller, and a fiber Bragg grating is presented. The detecting signals can be encoded in two-dimension, i.e., pulse widths and wavelengths, which is very suitable for high capacity PON monitoring. The final recognition process is very simple because only the rectangular pulse width needs to be identified, especially compared with the complicated network recognition algorithm.

The band structure and density of states (DOS) of single-layer In1-xGaxN are calculated, and the band gap ranges from 1.8 eV to 3.8 eV as the ratio x changes, illustrating the potential for the tunability of band gap values via Ga doped. We also have investigated optical properties of single-layer In1-xGaxN such as dielectric function, refractive index and absorption coefficient, the main peak of dielectric function spectrum and the absorption edge are found to have a remarkable blue-shift as the concentration of Ga increases. Furthermore, the optical properties of single-layer In1-xGaxN are analyzed based on the band structures and DOS analysis.

The content of adriamycin was detected by selective degradation of adramycin to adriamycinone. It was realized by a two-phase reaction system (water-chloroform reaction system), in which adriamycin was quantitatively converted to adriamycinone. Therefore, the latter can be used to calculate the precise content of adramycin in the polymer drug. To develop the method, the catalyst for degradation, the extraction solvent for adriamycinone, the temperature and time of degradation, and the ratio of pectin-adriamycin conjugate were investigated. The optimal reaction condition was as follows: 30 mg of pectin-adriamycin conjugate dissolved in 25 mL of water was added to a mixture of 25 mL of hydrochloric acid (1.5 mol/L) and 50 mL of chloroform; the mixture was heated to 40 degrees C to react for 1.5 h; after that, the mixture was extracted with chloroform for three times, and then the organic layer was combined and, subsequently, evaporated to remove solvent. Under this condition, adriamycinone generation rate reached 99.87%. The quantitative method was evaluated for linearity, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ), recovery, accuracy, robustness, and precision. The recoveries were between 99.47% and 101.07% with relative standard deviation <1.23%. The LOD and LOQ were 0.06 and 0.17 mu g/mL, respectively. Compared to the traditional ultraviolet (UV) detection, this method is considered to be more precise for detecting content of adriamycin in its polymer conjugate.

The first result is shown that if a coercivity condition holds, then the solution set of a variational inequality perturbed along a direction is nonempty and uniformly bounded. Second, by employing the Minty variational inequalities perturbed by a nonlinear mapping without monotonicity, we prove the boundedness result for the corresponding perturbed variational inequalities under a kind of coercivity condition.

Using the OLS, LASSO regression, and various combination forecasts, we obtain several noteworthy findings. First, we determine which indicators most effectively forecast oil price volatility. Specifically, the uncertainty index is notable. Second, in general, combination strategies and LASSO produce statistically and economically significant forecasts. Third, the combined and LASSO strategies perform considerably better during recessions than expansions. Overall, our study provides which indicators and strategies can improve forecasting accuracy in the oil market.

J	Zhang, PF; Yuan, XH; Du, YG; Li, JJ				Zhang, Pengfei; Yuan, Xianghua; Du, Yuguang; Li, Jian-Jun			Heterologous expression and biochemica characterization of a GHF9 endoglucanase from the termite Reticulitermes speratus in Pichia pastoris	BMC BIOTECHNOLOGY			English	Article						Reticulitermes speratus; GHF9 endoglucanse; Heterologous expression; Pichia pastoris; Enzymology	SACCHAROMYCES-CEREVISIAE; COPTOTERMES-FORMOSANUS; ASPERGILLUS-ORYZAE; CELLULASE GENE; LIGNOCELLULOSE; CLONING; MICROBIOTA; SYSTEMS; GUT; IDENTIFICATION	Background: Cellulases are of great significance for full utilization of lignocellulosic biomass. Termites have an efficient ability to degrade cellulose. Heterologous production of the termite-origin cellulases is the first step to realize their industrial applications. The use of P. pastoris for the expression of recombinant proteins has become popular. The endoglucanase from Reticulitermes speratus (RsEG), belonging to glycoside hydrolase family 9 (GHF9), has not been produced in P. pastoris yet. Results: A mutant RsEG(m) (G91A/Y97W/K429A) was successfully overexpressed in P. pastoris. RSEG(m), with optimum pH 5.0, was active over the pH range of 4.0 to 9.0, and exhibited superior pH stability over between pH 4.0 and pH 11.0. It displayed the highest activity and good stability at 40 degrees C, but lost activity quickly at 50 degrees C. The apparent kinetic parameters of RsEG(m) against Carboxymethyl Cellulose (CMC) were determined, with K-m and V-max of 7.6 mg/ml and 5.4 mol/min.mg respectively. Co2+, Mn2+ and Fe2+ enhanced the activity of RsEG(m) by 32.0, 19.5 and 11.2% respectively, while Pb2+ and Cu2+ decreased its activity by 19.6 and 12.7% separately. Conclusions: RsEG(m) could be overexpressed in P. pastoris. It was stable between pH 4.0 and pH 11.0, and exhibited higher stability at temperatures <= 40 degrees C. This endoglucanase may have potential to be used in the field of laundry, textile and lignocellulose-based biofuels and chemicals.

On the Occurrences of Japalura kumaonensis and Japalura tricarinata (Reptilia: Sauria: Draconinae) in China	HERPETOLOGICA			English	Article						Agamidae; Distribution; Species identification; Taxonomy	AGAMIDAE; DIVERSITY	Although the recognized distribution of Japalura kumaonensis is restricted largely to western Himalaya, a single, isolated outlier population was reported in eastern Himalaya at the China-Nepal border in southeastern Tibet, China in Zhangmu, Nyalam County. Interestingly, subsequent studies have recognized another morphologically similar species, J. tricarinata, from the same locality in Tibet based on photographic evidence only. Despite these reports, no studies have examined the referred specimens for either record to confirm their taxonomic identifications with robust comparisons to congener species. Here, we examine the referred specimen of the record of J. kumaonensis from southeastern Tibet, China; recently collected specimens from the same locality in southeastern Tibet; type specimens; and topotypic specimens of both J. kumaonensis and J. tricarinata, to clarify the taxonomic identity of the focal population from southeastern Tibet, China. Our results indicate that individuals of the referred Tibetan population differ from J. kumaonensis in external morphology, but match descriptions and specimens of J. tricarinata. We conclude that the previous record of J. kumaonensis from Tibet was a misidentification of J. tricarinata, and J. kumaonensis should be recognized as occurring in western Himalaya only. To facilitate future taxonomic studies of the genus Japalura sensu lato in the Himalaya, we provide a detailed description of J. tricarinata and an updated diagnostic key to the genus from the Himalaya.

In this paper, we extend this result to Prufer v-multiplication domains (PvMDs). To do this, we introduce the concept of w-pure exact. sequences over commutative rings with zero divisors, and we prove that a domain R is a PvMD if and only if for R-modules, relative divisibility implies w-purity. Also, we compare w-purity with purity and relative divisibility by giving examples.

Suppose there are six legitimate participants, says Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Emma and Fred in the scheme. It can be shown that Alice and David can remotely prepare a single-qubit state on Bob's side; meanwhile, Bob and Emma can remotely prepare a desired quantum state on Charlie's side, and Charlie and Fred can also remotely prepare a single-qubit state on Alice's side at the same time. Further, it can be achieved in the opposite direction of the cycle by changing the quantum channel. Based on it, we generalize this protocol to sides utilizing three multi-qubit GHZ-type states as quantum channel. Therefore, the scheme can achieve cyclic joint remote state preparation, which remotely prepares N states in quantum network with N-party, simultaneously. In addition, we consider that the effect of amplitude-damping noise of the initial states is prepared in four different laboratory. Clearly, we use fidelity to describe how much information has been lost in the cyclic process. Our investigation about the effect of noise shows that the preparing of the initial state in different laboratories will affect the loss of information.

X-ray diffraction patterns and Rietveld refinements were used to demonstrate the successful incorporation of Sc3+/Ga3+ into CSSO: Eu2+. All phosphors exhibit the general orthorhombic structure with space group of P21CN. Eu2+ activated CSSO phosphors exhibit strong absorption in the range of 260-450 nm and a green emission peak centered at about 506 nm. Under the excitation of 365 nm, the peak position for the Sc-Ga substitutions can be shifted from 506 to 524 nm, which is expected to obtain single-phased phosphors excited by UV-LEDs. The cosubstitution of [Sc3+-Ga3+] for [Ca2+-Si4+] can improve the thermal stability of the materials. This research is in favor of enriching colors of Eu2+ doped CSSO phosphors.

To enhance the minimum critical current located at two end, a novel flux diverter with a raised edge is investigated in this paper. Five small solenoid magnets having different axial layers and a fixed tape usage are used to evaluate and compare the effects of the raised-edge diverters on self-inductance, minimum critical current, and maximum energy storage capacity. An energy storage parameter K-E (J/m) obtained by dividing the maximum energy storage capacity by the tape usage, and an available energy parameter E-use (J) at a fixed rated output current are introduced to evaluate the overall economical efficiency and to form some design guidelines for various small SMES magnets.

To detect possible voltage disturbances quickly and, thus, to compensate the transient voltage waveform immediately after the occurrences of voltage disturbances, a new instantaneous d-q transform detection method is introduced. Subsequently, a pre-sag compensation strategy is introduced to lock the instantaneous magnitudes and phase angles of real-time line voltages for compensating the improper voltage components completely. A 0.3-H/1.76-kA superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) magnet is structurally designed for MW-class power exchange operations. Various simulation cases with regard to voltage sag, voltage swell, and overvoltage disturbances are carried out. The simulations and comparisons among two control schemes have demonstrated that the reductions of waveform distortions, the stabilization of root-mean-square voltages, and the suppressions of peak voltage come mainly from the cooperative operation of the d-q control method and the fast-response SMES device.

This paper investigates an integrated DFIG protection scheme with a modified superconducting magnetic energy storage-fault current limiter (SMES-FCL). Based on proper parameter estimation of superconducting coil (SC) inside the SMES-FCL, modified controls of the SC and rotor side converter (RSC) are presented. Simulation results obtained from a 1.5 MW DFIG-based wind turbine case show that the proposed scheme is capable of limiting the peak values of fault rotor current, DC-link voltage and electromagnetic (EM) torque under symmetrical and asymmetrical faults, and thus to protect the RSC, gearbox and mechanical parts of the whole DFIG. With an additional positive-sequence d-q current modification control, this scheme is also discussed to lower the SC current capacity, to shorten the recovery time after grid faults, and to smooth the active power of the DFIG during normal operations.

However, in this paper, Banach fixed point theory and technique is employed to derive a new stability criterion of high-order BAM neural networks with delays and impulse for the first time. It is worth mentioning that using Banach fixed point theorem and technique results in deleting a constraint condition on the allowable upper bounds of time delays of existing results. And it is the utilization of Banach fixed point theorem that makes us recognize that the stability of the high order BAM neural networks is independent of the limit of time delay if active functions are bounded. Moreover, a numerical example is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. (c) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In this process, NO3--N was selectively reduced to NO2--N and NH4+-N (molar ratio of 1:1) by Zn/Ag bimetallic material, and the produced NO2--N and NH4+-N were further converted to N-2 gas at high temperature (210 degrees C) and high pressure (1.1 MPa). Batch experiments indicated that at Zn/Ag bimetallic reduction, the NO3--N reduction efficiency of 90.9% was obtained under the condition of temperature of 40 degrees C, Zn/Ag bimetal dosage of 60 g L-1, reaction time of 30 min and the initial pH of 3.0. The optimal products molar ratio of the first reduction step was obtained by adjusting the experimental parameters (e.g. solution pH and reaction time) to achieve a satisfactory N-2 selectivity during the wet ammonia oxidation process, in which the maximum N-2 selectivity of 98.0% was achieved with 99.2% of NO2--N and 98.5% of NH4+-N were removed, respectively. The two-step method was further applied in the NO3--N reduction from membrane filtration concentrate, and 84.9% of TN removal efficiency with the N-2 selectivity of 94.5% was obtained.

Nesting-induced local electronic patterns around a single As (Te, Se) vacancy in iron-based superconductors	NEW JOURNAL OF PHYSICS			English	Article						Fe-based superconductors; ligand vacancy; nesting effect	BOUND-STATES; ORDER	The local electronic states around a single As (Te, Se) vacancy are investigated in order to shed light on the role of ligands in a series of iron-based superconductors. Such a vacancy can produce a local hopping correction ranging from -0.22 to 0.12 eV and always induce two in-gap resonance peaks in the local density of states (LDOS) at the fixed symmetrical bias voltages, which are rather robust and irrelevant to the phase of superconducting order parameter. The LDOS images near the defect predominantly possess 0 degrees and 45 degrees stripes. These energy-dependent charge modulations created by quasiparticle interference are originated in the nesting effect between the inner (outer) hole Fermi surface around Gamma point and the inner (outer) electron Fermi surface around M point.

Recent in situ experiments have shown that structure reconstruction of the NP occurs in real catalysis. However; the role played by supports in these processes is still unclear. Supports can be very important in real catalysis because of the new active sites at the perimeter interface between nano particles and supports. Herein, using a developed multiscale model coupled with in situ spherical aberration corrected (Cs-corrected) TEM experiments; we show that the interaction between the support and the gas environment greatly changes the contact surface between the metal and support, which further leads to the critical change in the perimeter interface. The dynamic changes chcnzges of the interface in reactive environments can thus be predicted and be included in the rational design of Supported metal nanocatalysts. In particular, our multiscale model shows quantitative consistency with experimental observations This work offers possibilities for obtaining atomic scale structures and insights beyond the experimental limits.

In this work, Li+-conductive Li2SnO3 was coated on the surface of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 to protect the cathode against the attack of HF, mitigate the dissolution of Mn ions during cycling and improve the Li+ diffusion coefficient of the materials. Remarkable improvement in cycling stability and rate performance has been achieved in Li2SnO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4. The 1.0 wt%Li2SnO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode exhibits excellent cycling stability with a capacity retention of 88.2% after 150 cycles at 0.1 C and rate capability at high discharge rates of 5 C and 10 C, presenting discharge capacities of 119.5 and 112.2 mAh g(-1), respectively. In particular, a significant improvement in cycling stability at 55 degrees C is obtained after the coating of 1.0 wt% Li2SnO3 , giving a capacity retention of 86.8% after 150 cycles at 1 C and 55 degrees C. The present study provides a significant insight into the effective protection of Li-conductive coating materials for a high-voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode material.

It is found that changes of the pulse duration and the beam spot size with the propagation distance are noticeable due to the interplay of the GVD effect and the selffocusing effect, which is quite different from the behavior in the linear case. It is shown that the temporal pulse splitting may appear on the space debris, and the spatial side lobe usually appears together with the temporal pulse splitting. As compared with the linear case, the beam width and the pulse width on the debris target increase. On the other hand, crucial formulae of the modified focal length and the M-2-factor for laser debris removal are also derived. It is found that the beam quality on the debris target becomes better if our modified focal length is adopted, and the beam quality on the debris target will be good if the value of M-2-factor is less than 1.6.

In this work, the current-driven skyrmion motion in a narrow ferromagnetic nanotrack with voltage-controlled magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) is studied numerically. By utilizing the VCMA effect, the transport of skyrmion can be unidirectional in the nanotrack, leading to a one-way information channel. The trajectory of the skyrmion can also be modulated by periodically located VCMA gates, which protects the skyrmion from destruction by touching the track edge. In addition, the location of the skyrmion can be controlled by adjusting the driving pulse length in the presence of the VCMA effect. Our results provide guidelines for practical realization of the skyrmion-based information channel, diode, and skyrmion-based electronic devices such as racetrack memory.

We aimed to assess impact of three important genes participating in vitamin K cycle (i.e. VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566) on the daily stable warfarin dose requirement in Sichuan Han Chinese patients with catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation. Methods: A total of 222 atrial fibrillation patients taking stable warfarin therapy after catheter ablation operation were enrolled in this study. The study population included had high (>= 2) risk according to the CHA2DS2-VASc risk score. Genotypes of VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 were analyzed by using the polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP). Multiple linear regression analysis was applied to depict the impact of VKORC1 rs9923231, CYP4F2 rs2108622 and NQO1 rs1800566 on the daily stable warfarin dose requirement. Results: Carriers of VKORC1 rs9923231 AG/GG genotypes required significantly higher warfarin dose (3.03 +/- 0. 28 mg/day, 7.19 mg/day, respectively) than AA carriers (2.52 +/- 0.07 mg/day; P < 0.001). Carriers of CYP4F2 rs2108622 CT/TT genotypes required significantly higher warfarin dose (3.38 +/- 0.22 mg/day, 2.79 +/- 0.19 mg/day, respectively) than CC carriers (2.41 +/- 0.08 mg/day; P < 0.001). However, the warfarin dose for carriers of NQO1 rs1800566 CT/TT genotypes (2.46 +/- 0.24 mg/day, 3.01 +/- 0.27 mg/day, respectively) was not significantly higher than that for the CC carriers (2.33 +/- 0.1 mg/day). The multiple linear regression model including genotypes and demographic characteristics, could explain 20.1% of individual variations in the daily stable warfarin dose in Sichuan Han Chinese. VKORC1 rs9923231 contributed most (15%) to the individual variations in daily stable warfarin dose, while CYP4F2 rs2108622 contributed least (3%). Conclusion: NQO1 rs1800566 is not a significant genetic factor of warfarin dose for Han Chinese, whereas VKORC1 rs9923231 and CYP4F2 rs2108622 are significant genetic factors, which could explain 15% and approximately 3% of individual variations in the daily stable warfarin dose respectively.

The experimental results showed that the particles of Zn and Fe in Zn-Fe-CNTs composite were adhered to the surface of CNTs, which accelerated the electron transfer process. The BET area of Zn-Fe-CNTs composite was 32.9 m(2)/g. The contents of Zn and Fe (% w) in the composite were 44.7% and 4.2%, respectively. The removal efficiency of 4-CP and TOC in Zn-Fe-CNTs/O-2 system was 90.8% and 52.9%, respectively, with the initial pH of 2.0, O-2 flow rate of 800 mL/min, Zn-Fe-CNTs dosage of 1.0 g/L, 4-CP concentration of 50 mg/L and reaction time of 20 min. Based on the analysis of the degradation intermediate products with LC-MS and IC, a possible degradation pathway of 4-CP in Zn-Fe-CNTs/O-2 system was proposed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

Different patterns on photoresist surface are obtained theoretically by adjusting optical coupling among neighboring spheres with different gap sizes. The effect of light reflection from the substrate on the pattern produced on the photoresist with a thin thickness is also discussed. Sub-micron hexagonal star-shaped and ring-shaped patterns arrays are achieved with closepacked spheres arrays and spheres arrays with big gaps, respectively. Changing of star-shaped vertices is induced by different polarization of illumination. Experimental results agree well with the simulation. By using smaller resonance spheres, sub-400 nm star-shaped and ring-shaped patterns can be realized. These tunable patterns are different from results of previous reports and have enriched pattern morphology fabricated by sphere-lens-lithography, which can find application in biosensor and optic devices.

Based on extraction, derivatization with 9-fluorenylmethylchloroformate and purification on solid phase extraction column, quantification was done by using isotopic-labeled analytes as internal standard and calibration in matrix. Good selectivity and sensitivity were achieved with a limit of quantification of 5 mu g/kg. The recoveries of these two pesticides ranged from 91% to 114% with inter-day and relative standard deviation of 3.8-6.1% in five matrices of cereal group spiked at 5, 10, and 20 mu g/kg. An accuracy profile was performed for method validation, demonstrating the accuracy and precision of the method for the studied food groups. The verification results in expanded food groups indicated extensive applicability for the analysis of glyphosate and glufosinate. Finally, the developed method was applied to analyze 136 food samples including milk-based baby foods from the French Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety. Glyphosate residues were detected in two breakfast cereal samples (6.0 and 34 mu g/kg). Glufosinate residues were found in a sample of boiled potatoes (9.8 mu g/kg). No residues were detected in the other samples, including milk-based baby foods with limits of detection ranging from 1 to 2 mu g/kg. The method has been applied for routine national monitoring of glyphosate and glufosinate in various foods. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

The results showed that CeO2@AC exhibits good catalytic activity with excellent stability. The ozonation reaction catalyzed by CeO2@AC led to a complete removal of OA (1.5 mM, 0.5 g/L catalyst) in 60 min and showed a 75% increase in OA removal compared to the single non-catalytic ozonation. After five consecutive reuse cycles, CeO2@AC showed almost the same catalytic performance with few only changes in ceria content and surface morphology.

Mo2C and its nanocomposites have been controlly synthesized by pyrolyzing the mixture of molybdenum salt and egg white (EW) that served as low-cost but environmental-friendly carbon source.

Effects of microwave field on the mixture were evaluated from the alteration in structure, transport, hydrogen bonding dynamics and intermolecular interaction energy. Increasing the strength of the microwave field did not lead to any markedly conformational change, but decrease the diffusion coefficient. Prolonged hydrogen bonding lifetimes, which caused by the redistribution of microwave energy, was also detected. Distinct threshold effect was observed, which was consistent with the behavior in the experiment.

Here, we systematically investigate the lattice structures, and electronic and magnetic properties of hydrogenated arsenene decorated with certain transition metals (Cr, Mo and Cu) based on density-functional theory. A unique QAH effect in Mo@AsH is predicted, whose Chern number (C = 1) indicates only one chiral edge channel located on its one side. Then, we prove that this QAH effect realization is closely related with band inversion, which is the competitive result between its spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength and exchange field. The quantum state of Mo@AsH can also be tuned by an external strain, similar to SOC, and it is noted that its increased topological gap of about 35 meV under 5.0% tensile strain, is large enough to realize the QAH effect at room-temperature. Additionally, the quantum valley Hall effect in Cu@AsH contributed by the inequality of AB sublattices is also found. Our results reveal the physical mechanism to realize the QAH effect in TM@AsH and provide a platform for electrically controllable topological states, which are highly desirable for nanoelectronics and spintronics.

The cure reaction between hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB) and diisocyanates plays a key role in the properties of final products as well as the adjustment of process parameters. FT-IR spectroscopy is applied to investigate the kinetics of the curing reaction of HTPB and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) in the presence of a low toxic and low viscosity catalyst, stannous isooctoate (TECH). The concentrations of the isocyanate groups (NCO) characterized by FT-IR during the cure reaction with respect to time were recorded at different temperatures and at constant stoichiometric ratio R-n[NCO]/n[OH] = 1.0. The kinetic parameters, i.e., activation energy (E-a), pre-exponential factor (A), activation enthalpy (H) and activation entropy (S) were determined. In addition, the curing process and mechanism of the HTPB-IPDI reaction are discussed.

Herein, we reported the in situ synthesis of AgCo bimetallic nanoparticles supported on g-C3N4 and concomitant hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen evolution at room temperature. The as-synthesized Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 catalysts displayed the highest turnover frequency (TOF) value of 249.02 mol H-2 center dot(mol(Ag)center dot min)(-1) for hydrogen evolution from the hydrolysis of ammonia borane, which was higher than many other reported values. Furthermore, the Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 catalyst could be recycled during five consecutive runs. The study proves that Ag0.1Co0.9/g-C3N4 is a potential catalytic material toward the hydrolysis of ammonia borane for hydrogen production.

Many studies have explored the specificity of human faces through ERP or other ways, and the materials they used are general human faces and other objects. Therefore, we want to further explore the difference between attractive faces and beautiful objects such as flowers. Methods: We recorded the eye movement of 22 male observers and 23 female observers using a standard two-alternative forced choice. Results: (1) The attractive faces were looked at longer and more often in comparison with the beautiful flowers; (2) fixation counts of female participants are more than male participants; and (3) the participants watched the beautiful flowers first, followed by the attractive faces, but there was no significant difference on the first fixation duration between the beautiful flowers and the attractive faces. Conclusions: The data in this study may suggest that people prefer attractive faces to beautiful flowers.

Polyploidy or whole-genome duplication has played a pervasive and ongoing role in the evolution of all eukaryotes, and is the most dramatic force known to cause rapid karyotypic reconfiguration, especially at the initial stage. However, issues concerning transgenerational propagation of karyotypic heterogeneity and its translation to phenotypic diversity in nascent allopolyploidy, at the population level, have yet to be studied in detail. Here, we report a large-scale examination of transgenerationally propagated karyotypic heterogeneity and its phenotypic manifestation in an artificially constructed allotetraploid with a genome composition of AADD, that is, involving two of the three progenitor genomes of polyploid wheat. Specifically, we show that 1) massive organismal karyotypic heterogeneity is precipitated after 12 consecutive generations of selfing from a single euploid founder individual, 2) there exist dramatic differences in aptitudes between subgenomes and among chromosomes for whole-chromosome gain and/or loss and structural variations, 3) majority of the numerical and structural chromosomal variations are concurrent due to mutual contingency and possible functional constraint, 4) purposed and continuous selection and propagation for euploidy over generations did not result in enhanced karyotype stabilization, and 5) extent of karyotypic variation correlates with variability of phenotypic manifestation. Together, our results document that allopolyploidization catalyzes rampant and transgenerationally heritable organismal karyotypic heterogeneity that drives population-level phenotypic diversification, which lends fresh empirical support to the still contentious notion that whole-genome duplication enhances organismal evolvability.

The prominent characteristic of the MSM operator is that it can capture the interrelationship among the multiinput arguments. In this paper, we extend MSM to Pythagorean fuzzy environment to propose the Pythagorean fuzzy Maclaurin symmetric mean and Pythagorean fuzzy weighted Maclaurin symmetric mean operators. Then, some desirable properties and special cases of these operators are discussed in detail. Finally, a numerical example is provided to illustrate the feasibility of the proposed methods and deliver a comparative analysis. (C) 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Here our first-principles study indicates that the structure with the space group P $(6) over bar $ c2 is energetically more stable than the P $(6) over bar $ m2 phase. We systematically investigated its electronic, optical, vibrational, infrared, and elastic properties. The results reveal that KCdCO3F is a direct-band-gap insulator with rather flat bands below the Fermi level. Analyses of its partial density of states revealed that the top (bottom) of its valence (conduction) band is formed by the O 2p (Cd 5s) orbital. It is a negative uniaxial crystal with ionic-covalent nature. Both infrared-active and Raman-active modes exist at its Brillouin zone center, and ions contribute more to its static dielectric constants. Its optical spectra in the visual and infrared ranges were studied, and their origins were revealed. Calculations indicate that KCdCO3F is mechanically stable but anisotropic since it is more vulnerable to shear stress and is easy to cleave along the c axis.

When simulated wastewater with Hg(II) concentration of 1000 mg L-1 was treated, > 90% of Hg(II) removal efficiency was achieved under the condition of extra Cl- dosage of 5 g L-1, FA dosage of 2 g L-1, pH of 3.0 and 120 min of UV irradiation. Kinetics study showed that the photoreduction process could be well described by pseudo first order kinetic mode, and the Hg(II) reduction rate was tested to be 0.0422 min(-1). Characterization results indicated that FA-Hg(II) complexes were firstly formed and then broken,down into smaller molecules after the UV treatment, in which process highly reductive species (i.e. COO, -COOH) were produced. These reductive species mediated the reduction of Hg(II). With the presence of Cl-, Hg2Cl2 was practically the only detected Hg-based product in the photoreduction process. This technique was also employed to treat CODCr analysis wastewater (initial Hg(II) concentration > 1000 mg L-1). With 90 min of reaction, most of the Hg(II) was removed from the system leaving less than 30% that could be further treated by chemical participation or adsorption method. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this work, we report the design and the straightforward synthesis of a homologous series of compounds containing the BTBT substructure by the successive Suzuki cross-coupling and FeCl3 oxidative Scholl cyclodehydrogenation reaction. Target p-conjugated aromatic, H-shaped sanidic mesogens self-organize into a classical hexagonal columnar mesophase over wide temperature ranges as deduced from polarized optical microscopy (POM), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) investigations. UV/Vis absorption and photoluminescence spectra, measured in both solution and films, revealed strong photoluminescence with high quantum yields. The charge carrier mobility measured by the time-of-flight (TOF) technique showed a balanced ambipolar hole and electron mobility in the range of 10(-3) cm(2) V-1 s(-1) between 100 and 230 degrees C in the mesophase. These BTBT-based columnar liquid crystals may represent attractive candidates to be incorporated within one-dimensional organic optoelectronic devices.

Its ability to distinguish between correct (cognate) and incorrect (noncognate) nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) is important for fidelity control in transcription. In this work, we investigated the substrate selection mechanism of T7 RNAP from the perspective of energetics. The dissociation free energies were determined for matched and unmatched base pairs in the preinsertion complex using the umbrella sampling method. A clear hydrogen-bond-rupture peak is observed in the potential of mean force curve for a matched base pair, whereas no such peaks are present in the position of mean force profiles for unmatched ones. The free-energy barrier could prevent correct substrates from being separated from the active site. Therefore, when NTPs diffuse into the active site, correct ones will stay for chemistry once they establish effective base pairing contacts with the template nucleotide, whereas incorrect ones will be withdrawn from the active site and rejected back to solution. This result provides an important energy evidence for the substrate selection mechanism of RNAP. Then we elucidated energetics and molecular details for correct NTP binding to the active site of the insertion complex. Our observations reveal that strong interactions act on the triphosphate of NTP to constrain its movement, whereas relatively weak interactions serve to position the base in the correct conformation. Triple interactions, hydrophobic contacts from residues M635 and Y639, base stacking from the 3' RNA terminal nucleotide, and base pairing from the template nucleotide act together to position the NTP base in a catalytically competent conformation. At last, we observed that incorrect NTPs cannot be as well-stabilized as the correct one in the active site when they are misincorporated in the insertion site. It is expected that our work can be helpful for comprehensively understanding details of this basic step in genetic transcription.

To address such a challenge, we use a succulent-based carbon aerogel (SCA), which consists of the epidermis, palisade tissue and spongy tissue, as an encapsulation scaffold for paraffin to fabricate PCM composites. The spongy tissue consisting of rich closed spherical cells allows a high loading efficiency (up to 95 wt%) for organic PCM, while the tightly-arranged palisade tissue and dense epidermis cells can act as two protective layers to prevent the leakage of liquid, enabling a mass loss as low as 1.3 wt% upon phase change. The PCM composites also show a high latent heat approaching that of pure paraffin and an excellent thermal cycling performance with 100% retention after being tested by using a differential scanning calorimeter 20 times. Moreover, the SCA not only serves as thermal conductive paths within the organic matrix, thereby remarkably enhancing the thermal conductivity of the PCM composites, but also acts as an effective photon captor and molecular heater, thus significantly increasing the light-to-thermal energy conversion efficiency of the PCM composites. As such, the SCA is an ideal multifunctional scaffold for PCM, which can advance the practical applications of PCM composites.

J	Wu, JJ; Gong, K; Wang, C; Wang, L				Wu Jia-Jian; Gong Kai; Wang Cong; Wang Lei			Enhancing resilience of interdependent networks against cascading failures under preferential recovery strategies	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						interdependent networks; cascading failures; failures-recovery model; preferential recovery strategy	INFLUENTIAL NODES; COMPLEX NETWORKS; DEPENDENCY	Interdependent networks are extremely fragile because a very small node failure in one network would trigger a cascade of failures in the entire system. Therefore, the resilience of interdependent networks is always a critical issue studied by researchers in different fields. Existing studies mainly focused on protecting several influential nodes for enhancing robustness of interdependent networks before the networks suffer random failures. In reality, it is necessary to repair a failing interdependent network in time to prevent it from suffering total breakdown. Recent investigations introduce a failure-recovery model for studying the concurrent failure process and recovery process of interdependent networks based on a random recovery strategy. This stochastic strategy covers repairing a small fraction of mutual boundary nodes which are the failed neighbors of the giant connected component of each network, with a random probability of recovery gamma. Obviously, the random recovery is simple and straightforward. Here, we analyze the recovery process of interdependent networks with two types of connectivity links, i.e., the first-type connectivity links and the second-type connectivity links, which represent the mutual boundary nodes(being also failed nodes) linked to survival nodes in current giant connected component, and linked to failed nodes out of current giant connected component in networks, respectively. We find that when mutual boundary nodes have more first-type connectivity links, the current giant connected component has higher average degree and immediately makes better interdependent network resilience, on the other hand, more second-type connectivity links generate more candidates during the recovery procedure, and indirectly make better system resilience. In short, two types of connectivity links of mutual boundary nodes both have great effects on the resilience of interdependent networks during the recovery. In this paper, we propose a new recovery strategy (preferential recovery based on connectivity link, or PRCL) to identify the mutual boundary node recovery influence in interdependent networks, based on the failure-recovery model. By defining two indexes that represent the numbers of first-type and links second-type connectivity links, respectively, we calculate the boundary influence with one parameter f by combining together with two indexes. After calculating all boundary nodes in the current process, we obtain a boundary importance index which is more accurate to indicate recovery influence of boundary node for each boundary node in interdependent networks. Our strategy is applied to interdependent networks constructed by ER random network or/and scale-free network with the same average degree. And a dynamical model of random failure based on percolation theory is used to make a comparison of performance between PRCL and other recovery strategies(including random recovery, preferential recovery based on degree, preferential recovery based on local centrality) in terms of four quantitative indices, i.e., probability of existence of the giant connected component, number of iteration steps, recovery robustness and average degree of the steady state of the giant connected component. Experiments on different interdependent networks (ER-ER/SF-SF/ER-SF/SF-ER) demonstrate that with a very small number of mutual boundary node recoveries by PRCL strategy, the resilience and robustness of entire system under the recovery process can be greatly enhanced. Finally, the only parameter f in PRCL strategy is also discussed. Our strategy is meaningful in practice as it can largely enhance interdependent network resilience and contribute to the decrease of system breakdown risk.

Molecular structure, transport characteristics, hydrogen bonds dynamics and vibration power spectra were obtained by using the OPLS and TIP4P models. Simulation results show that the atrazine molecules do not have a significant effect in water and the tiny solubility of atrazine due to the molecular surface area and structure. As the temperature increases, the water's tetrahedral structure and the hydrated shells are weakened. The hydrogen bonding lifetimes of atrazine-water and water-water show a decrease with temperature. The self diffusion coefficient of water increase linearly and the self-diffusion coefficient of atrazine shows an nonlinear increment. The vibration power spectrum of atrazine was calculated and compared with the existing infrared spectra. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In alpha-Be2C, a carbon atom binds to eight Be atoms, forming an octacoordinate carbon moiety. This is the first example of an octacoordinate carbon containing material. The other two structures, beta-Be2C and gamma-Be2C, are quasi planar hexacoordinate carbon (phC) containing 2D materials. Good stability with these three phases is revealed by their lower cohesive energy and positive phonon modes. More interestingly, these predicted new phases of Be2C are all semiconductors and have unusual negative Poisson's ratios (NPRs). If synthesized, 2D Be2C materials will have a broad range of applications in electronics and mechanics.

The influences of the concentration of yttrium ion (Y3+) on the micro-structures, upconversion (UC) luminescent and magnetic properties of the Ba(Gd1-xYx)(0.78)F-5: 20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Tm3+ samples have been deeply investigated. XRD results showed that all the Ba(Gd1-xYx)(0.78)F-5: 20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Tm3+ crystals are continuous solid solution possess a pure cubic phase structure. SEM and TEM results revealed that all the obtained crystals are quasi-spherical nanocrystals with a diameter ranging from similar to 55 nm to similar to 240 nm, and the doping of Y3+ ion can inhibit the grain growth. PL spectra indicated that all the samples exhibit main blue emission centered at 478 nm ascribed to (1)G(4)-> H-3(6) transition of Tm3+ ions, and its UC emission intensity initially increases and then notably decreases with increasing content of Y3+ ion, giving the maximum at x = 0.8. VSM results showed that all the samples present benign paramagnetism in the magnetic range of -30 to 30 kOe at 300 K due to no coercivity or no remanence. Our results confirm that the UC luminescence properties of the Ba(Gd1-xYx)(0.78)F-5: 20 mol% Yb3+, 2 mol% Tm3+ nanocrystals can be effectively modulated through the replacement of Gd3+ ions by Y3+ ions, which also can provide a relatively clear understanding of the formation process and the enhancement mechanism of UC emission for other rare earth polyfluoride solid solution nanocrystals.

Herein, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) prepared through the simply pyrolysis of urea was employed as a support for Rh nanoparticles (NPs) stabilization. The in-situ generated Rh NPs supported on g-C3N4 with an average size of 3.1 nm were investigated as catalysts for hydrogen generation from the hydrolysis of AB under mild conditions. The Rh/g-C3N4 catalyst exhibits a high turnover frequency of 969 mol H-2 center dot (min.mol(Rh))(-1) and a low activation energy of 24.2 kJ/mol. The results of the kinetic studies show that the catalytic hydrolysis of AB over the Rh/g-C3N4 catalyst is a zero-order reaction with the AB concentration and a first-order reaction with the Rh concentration. This work demonstrates that g-C3N4 is a useful support to design and synthesis of effective Rh-based catalyst for hydrogen-based applications. (C) 2018 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC.

The micromotors are prepared by simply coating the hemispherical surface of Fe3O4-nanoparticle-containing mesoporous SiO2 microparticles with a polydopamine layer for decorating Ag nanoparticles, based on the versatile adhesion and reduction properties of polydopamine. The Fe3O4 nanoparticles can produce OH radicals from H2O2 for pollutant degradation via Fenton reaction, whereas the mesoporous SiO2 matrix provides large surface area with anchored Fe3O4 nanoparticles for improved degradation performance. Moreover, the Ag nanopartides can decompose H2O2 into oxygen bubbles for powering the movement of micromotors to further enhance the pollutant degradation. The micromotors that synergistically integrate these functions enable efficient degradation of pollutants, such as methylene blue demonstrated in this work, for water remediation. This approach offers a simple and versatile strategy for creating micromotors with flexible compositions and structures for applications in water remediation, drug delivery, and cargo transport.

We introduce some notions, such as picture fuzzy ideal point, the modules of picture fuzzy numbers. We also introduce the cosine of the included angle between the attribute value vectors of each alternative and the picture fuzzy ideal point. Then we establish the projection model to measure the similarity degrees between each alternative and the picture fuzzy ideal point.

However, compared with natural slope soils, the quality of artificial soils on rock-cut slopes is low. Enzyme activity and microbial biomass are the main indices used for estimating soil quality; thus, our objective was to explore the influence of slope position, slope aspect, and season on two important factors that positively influence the plant growth capability in artificial soil. Further, we suggest modifications of the proportions of OSSS ingredients, not only to manage cut slopes more economically but also to provide a new framework for managing desertification. We chose a bare-cut-slope that had been restored five years ago near the Suiyu Railway (Chongqing-Suining), in Sichuan Province, China, as our study plot. Soil samples were collected at a depth of 10 cm. We conclude that natural slopes exhibited higher urease, sucrase, and catalase activity and higher microbial biomass than cut slopes. The protease and polyphenoloxidase enzyme activities and the microbial biomass were higher on the cut slopes in the months of October and January, with the highest protease activity in October, and the highest polyphenoloxidase activity in January. The enzyme activity and microbial biomass were always lower on lower slopes, with the exception of polyphenoloxidase activity. The slope aspect influenced soil enzyme activity, resulting in higher activity on north-facing slopes than on south-facing slopes. These results provided scientific support for artificial revegetation methods in an ecological context. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Dual-modification of coating and doping of fast-ion conductor Li2SiO3 leads to stable crystal structure and additional three-dimensional (3-D) channels for Li+-ion diffusion, and protects the electrode surface from electrolyte attack. The Li2SiO3-modified material possesses coexistence of ordered P4(3)32 and disordered Fd-3m phases. As a result of improved structure, morphology and conductivity, the Li2SiO3-modified LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 shows more superior cyclic performance, rate capability and high temperature stability than the pristine: capacity retention of 95.17% at 0.1 C after 100 cycles vs. that of 79.23%; rate capability of 130-89.1 mAh g(-1) at 0.1-10 C vs. that of 120-57.6 mAh g(-1); and high temperature capacity retention of 99.42% at 0.1 C vs. that of 79.59%. Our study provides a facile approach to stabilize crystal structure, optimize morphology and conductivity, and thus enhance electrochemical performance of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-based materials.

To reverse this trend, China implemented the Classified Forest Management policy in the Natural Forest Conservation Program in 1998 to protect forests from excessive harvesting. However, the policy was unable to meet the 2020 commitment of increasing growing stock (set in the Kyoto Protocol) because of high-intensity harvesting. Accordingly, China banned all commercial harvesting in Northeast China in 2014. In this study, we investigated the long-term impacts of the no commercial harvest (NCH) policy on ecosystem services and biodiversity using a forest landscape model, LANDIS PRO 7.0, in the temperate forests of the Small Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. We designed three management scenarios: The H scenario (the Classified Forest Management policy used in the past), the NCH scenario (the current Commercial Harvest Exclusion policy), and the LT scenario (mitigation management, i.e., light thinning). We compared total aboveground forest biomass, biomass by tree species, abundance of old-growth forests, and diversity of tree species and age class in three scenarios from 2010 to 2100. We found that compared with the H scenario, the NCH scenario increased aboveground forest biomass, abundance of old-growth forests, and biomass of most timber species over time; however, it decreased the biomass of rare and protected tree species and biodiversity. We found that the LT scenario increased the biomass of rare and protected tree species and biodiversity in comparison with the NCH scenario, while it maintained aboveground forest biomass and abundance of old-growth forests at a high level (slightly less than the NCH scenario). We concluded there was trade-off between carbon storage and biodiversity. We also concluded that light thinning treatment was able to regulate the trade-off and alleviate the negative effects associated with the NCH policy. Our results highlighted limitations of the NCH policy and provided new insights into sustainable forest management and the interdependence between human society and the forest ecosystem.

Moreover, the catalytic performance of the obtained Pd-based catalysts was evaluated towards the hydrogenation of o-chloronitrobenzene (o-CNB). Observations indicate that the as-prepared UV-irradiated Pd/NiO catalyst with a mole fraction 0.2% (0.2%Pd/NiO) has higher activity and selectivity in the o-CNB hydrogenation. Especially, UV-light irradiation played a positive role in the improvement of catalytic activity of 0.2%Pd/NiO catalyst, exhibiting an excess 11-fold activity superiority in contrast with non-UV-irradiated 0.2%Pd/NiO catalyst. In addition, it was investigated that effects of varied factors (i.e., reaction time, temperature, o-CNB/Pd ratio, Pd loading, hydrogen pressure) on the selective hydrogenation of o-CNB catalyzed by UV-irradiated 0.2%Pd/NiO catalyst. Under the reaction conditions of 60 degrees C, 0.5 h, 1 MPa H-2 pressure, 100% conversion of o-CNB, and 81.1% o-CAN selectivity were obtained, even at high molar ratio (8000:1) of o-CNB to Pd.

The catalysts were systematically and specifically characterized by means of XRD, XPS, TEM-EDX and SEM to clarify the structure-property correlation. It was found that the PtCox/CF-BT catalysts exhibited significantly enhanced catalytic activity and desirable stability in catalytic hydrogenation of CAL, which is ascribed to the synergistic interaction between bimetallic components, the effective dispersion, the anchoring role of CF-BT matrix on bimetallic NPs, as well as the lower mass transfer resistance of the matrix.

Methods This study chose maize (Zea mays L.), which is widely grown in C. ambrosioides invaded field as the receptor plant, and investigated the allelochemical effect of C. ambrosioides volatile oil and its two main components (alpha-terpinene and cymene) on maize root tip cells using a suspended gas method and TdT-mediated dUTP Nick-End Labeling (TUNEL) assays. The allelochemical effect on the relative expression of the apoptosis-associated type II Metacaspase gene ZmMCII was measured by quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). The allelochemical effect on mitochondrial characteristics was analyzed by staining assays. Results The results showed that applications of C. ambrosioides volatile oil, alpha-terpinene, and cymene on maize root tip cells caused membrane lipid peroxidation, increased mitochondrial H2O2 and MDA contents, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, released mitochondrial Cyt c and Ca2+ into the cytoplasm, and increased cytosolic Ca2+ level and expression of the type II Metacaspase gene ZmMCII. These apoptotic effects were time-dependent. Conclusions It suggested that C. ambrosioides volatile allelochemicals induced accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and triggered mitochondrion-mediated Ca2+- and Caspase-dependent apoptosis signaling pathways in receptor plant cells.

Through the analysis of adsorption geometries, amino group and side chains of AAs have been identified as the major side to adsorb on TiO2, while the carboxyl group prefers to stay outside to avoid the repulsion between negatively charged oxygen from TiO2 and AAs. On the surface, two-coordinated oxygen is the major site to stabilize AAs through O-H interactions. The above conclusion does not change when it is in the aqueous solution based on the calculations with AAs surrounded by explicit water molecules. The above knowledge is helpful in predicting how AAs and even peptides adsorb on inorganic materials.

Three-dimensional (3D) knee joint finite element models were established for healthy volunteers (normal group) and patients receiving computer-aided surgery (CAS) or conventional (traditional surgery [TS]) ACL reconstruction. The stress and stress distribution on the ACL, tibial, femoral articular cartilage, and meniscus were examined after force was applied on the 3D knee joint finite element models. No significant differences were observed in the stress on ACL among normal group, CAS group, and TS group when a femoral backward force was loaded. However, when a vertical force of 350 N was loaded on the knee joints, TS group had significant higher stress on the articular cartilage and meniscus than the other two groups at any flexion angle of 0, 30, 60, and 90 degrees. However, no significant differences were observed between CAS group and normal group. In conclusion, computer-aided ACL reconstruction has advantages over conventional surgery approach in restoring the biomechanical properties of knee joints, thus reducing the risk of damage to the knee joint cartilage and meniscus after ACL reconstruction.

J	Qiao, Z; Koolen, J				Qiao, Zhi; Koolen, Jack			A valency bound for distance-regular graphs	JOURNAL OF COMBINATORIAL THEORY SERIES A			English	Article						Distance-regular graphs; 3-Chromatic; Valency bound; Smallest eigenvalue		The regular complete t-partite graphs K-txs (s, t positive integers at least 2) with valency k = (t - 1)s have smallest eigenvalue -s = -k/(t - 1), and hence, for fixed t there are infinitely many of them. In this paper we will show that these graphs are exceptional graphs for the class of distance regular graphs. For this we will show a valency bound for distance-regular graphs with a relatively large, in absolute value, smallest eigenvalue. Using this bound, we classify the non-bipartite distance-regular graphs with diameter at most three with smallest eigenvalue not larger than -k/2, where k is the valency of the graph. As an application we complete the classification of the 3-chromatic distance-regular graphs with diameter three, which was started by Blokhuis, Brouwer and Haemers. (C) 2017 Elsevier Inc.

J	He, S; Duan, LW; Chen, QH				He, Shu; Duan, Liwei; Chen, Qing-Hu			Improved Silbey-Harris polaron ansatz for the spin-boson model	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							DYNAMICS; SYSTEM	In this paper, the well-known Silbey-Harris (SH) polaron ansatz for the spin-boson model is improved by adding orthogonal displaced Fock states. The obtained results for the ground state in all baths converge very quickly within finite displaced Fock states and corresponding SH results are corrected considerably. Especially for the sub-Ohmic spin-boson model, the converging results are obtained for 0 < s < 1/2 in the fourth-order correction and very accurate critical coupling strengths of the quantum phase transition are achieved. Converging magnetization in the biased spin-boson model is also arrived at. Since the present improved SH ansatz can yield very accurate, even almost exact results, it should have wide applications and extensions in various spin-boson model and related fields.

The absorption bandwidth is enhanced by three times compared with single-band absorption while high absorbance is maintained. The coherent perfect absorption is polarization-independent and can be independently modulated at each resonant frequency by tuning the phase difference of two coherent incident beams. Moreover, the resonant frequency is sensitive to the radius of the columnar patch, and thus a wide coherent perfect absorption frequency range can be obtained by adjusting the radius. Through optimizing the structural parameters, nearly perfect absorption at oblique incidence for both TE and TM polarizations are achieved. The optimized metasurface can be used as a beamsplitter at oblique incidence.

We used nitrogen uptake kinetics and algal cell yield to characterize the algal bioavailability of 22 dissolved DON compounds that are commonly found in natural surface waters and wastewater treatment plant effluents, including urea, amino acids, amino sugars, nucleotides, pyrimidines, oraganonitriles, polyacrylamide, EDTA, caffeine, phenolic compounds and humic acids. Twelve of these compounds were highly bioavailable, including urea, dissolved free amino acids, bovine serum albumin, DNA, RNA, ATP, AMP, acetonitrile and caffeine. Four compounds had intermediate bioavailability including two humic acids (Elliott Soil and Pahokee Peat), glycylglycine, RNA and uracil. The remaining six compounds were classified as recalcitrant, i.e., EDTA, 2,3-Dinitrophenol, aminobenzoic acid, polyacrylamide and Aldrich humic acid. For many of the compounds tested, the algal cell yield was only 60-80% of expected relative to DON uptake. These results help explain why some DON compounds are more likely to persist in natural systems, and why the DON pool is often recalcitrant in surface waters. (c) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Various pulse widths can be easily obtained by configuring the appropriate length of the patchcord used to generate the path difference between two branches of a 1 x 2 splitter. Different wavelengths can be assigned to the same pulse width, which can further increase the network size. The optimized parameters of the AL are investigated and analysis models are established. The calculation results show that the proposed scheme has smaller correlation distance (CD) and lower multiple-customers interference probability (MCIP) than the periodic coding (PC) scheme. A simplified PON system with 8 ONUs is set up to experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed scheme. The network recognition processing used to identify the reflected monitoring signals in the proposed scheme is simple, especially compared with the reduced complexity maximum likelihood sequence estimation (RC-MLSE) used in the typical PC scheme.

Thirty-two participants were divided into two groups: the deceptive group (liars) and the non-deceptive group (ND group, innocents). All the participants were required to undergo a simulated interrogation by a computer. The participants from the deceptive group were instructed to tell a mix of lies and truths and those of the ND group were instructed always to tell the truth. Based on the number of deceptions, the participants of the deceptive group were further divided into a infrequently deceptive group (IFD group, infrequent liars) and a frequently deceptive group (FD group, frequent liars). The infrequent liars exhibited greater neural activities than the frequent liars and the innocents in the left middle frontal gyrus (MFG) when performing the deception detection tasks. While performing deception detection tasks, infrequent liars showed significantly greater neural activation in the left MFG than the baseline, but frequent liars and innocents did not exhibit this pattern of neural activation in any area of inhibition-related brain regions. The results of individual analysis showed an acceptable accuracy of detecting infrequent liars, but an unacceptable accuracy of detecting frequent liars. These results suggest that using fNIRS monitoring of inhibition-related brain regions is feasible for detecting infrequent liars, for whom deception may be more effortful and therefore more physiologically marked, but not frequent liars.

In this paper, a type of polyurethane containing carboxyl groups is reported that demonstrates thermally assisted healing effects. This polymer can be healed even 72 h after cutting and also has a repeatable healing property. The self-healing efficiency can reach 90% when comparing the tensile strength of the healed sample to the original sample. Carboxyl content plays an important role in the self-healing property; polyurethane with no carboxyl groups cannot be healed. The mechanism of self-healing showed that hydrogen bonding interactions between carboxyl groups and diffusion of poly(ethylene glycol) chains contribute to the self-healing behavior.

J	Wu, T; Ji, XL; Luo, YJ				Wu Tong; Ji Xiao-Ling; Luo Yu-Juan			Characteristic parameters of adaptive optical imaging system in oceanic turbulence	ACTA PHYSICA SINICA			Chinese	Article						oceanic turbulence; Strehl ratio; Greenwood time constant; isoplanatic angle	SCINTILLATION; PROPAGATION; RESOLUTION; BEHAVIOR	Since recently one is interested in underwater communications, imaging, sensing and lidar appeared, it is important to study characteristic parameters of the adaptive optical imaging system in oceanic turbulence. Until now, the characteristic parameters of the adaptive optical imaging system in atmospheric turbulence have investigated widely and in depth, but those in oceanic turbulence have been examined seldom. It is known that the atmospheric turbulence is induced by the temperature fluctuation. However, the oceanic turbulence is induced by both the temperature fluctuation and the salinity fluctuation. The temperature and salinity spectra have similar "bumped" profiles, with bumps occurring at different wave numbers. Thus, the behavior of light propagation in oceanic turbulence is very different from that in atmospheric turbulence. In this paper, the influence of oceanic turbulence on characteristic parameters (i.e., strehl ratio, Greenwood time constant, and isoplanatic angle) of the adaptive optical imaging system is studied. The approximate analytical expression of the Strehl ratio for the short-exposure imaging case is derived. It is demonstrated by the numerical calculation method that this Strehl ratio approximate expression is accurate enough except the near field when DG/ro = 1 (where DG is the pupil diameter of the optical system, To is the seeing parameter in oceanic turbulence), and the relative error maximum of this Strehl ratio approximate expression in the far field is much smaller than that in the near field. In addition, the analytical expressions of the Greenwood time constant and the isoplanatic angle in oceanic turbulence are also obtained in this paper. It is shown that the values of the three characteristic parameters (i.e., Strehl ratio, the Greenwood time constant and the isoplanatic angle) decrease when salinity-induced optical turbulence dominates gradually. The Strehl ratio, the Greenwood time constant and the isoplanatic angle also decrease as the rate of dissipation of kinetic energy per unit mass of seawater decreases or the rate of dissipation of mean-squared temperature increases. It is known that the isoplanatic angle at wavelength lambda = 0.5 mu m are roughly 7-10 mu rad for a nearly vertical path from Earth to space in atmospheric turbulence. However, it is shown in this paper that the isoplanatic angle may be on the order of mu rad after 100 m propagation distance in oceanic turbulence. Therefore, the influence of oceanic turbulence on the isoplanatic angle is very large. The results obtained in this paper will be useful in the applications of adaptive optics imaging systems involving oceanic turbulence channels.

Harsh environments, human activities and climate warming have long threatened the diversity of forest genetic resources. Among all conservation strategies, cryopreservation is at present time considered an ideal means for long-term conservation of plant genetic resources. To date, studies on cryopreservation of forest trees have been far behind agricultural and horticultural crops. The present review provides a comprehensive and update information on recent advances in cryopreservation of shoot tips, somatic embryogenic callus and seeds of forest trees. Assessments of genetic stability in the regenerants following cryopreservation were also analyzed and addressed. Further studies on cryopreservation of forest trees are proposed and needed. By doing so, we expect to re-evoke research interests and promote further developments in forest tree cryobiotechnology, thus assisting to ensure maintenance of biodiversity of genetic resources of forest trees.

However, these features usually come with the severe carbon loss during pyrolysis and activation process. Herein, we report a facile self-terminated activation strategy for high-yield production of nitrogen and phosphorus codoped nanoporous carbon (NP-NC) by using potassium phytate as carbonaceous source. The in-situ formed potassium species enable the effective carbon activation to create plenty of nanopores without additional corrosive chemicals while the formation of K4P2O7 properly terminates the activation, resulting in the extremely low weight loss less than 17%. Benefited from the high surface area of 1294 m(2) g(-1) and trimodal nanoporous structure, the resulted N, P-codoped catalyst exhibits superior ORR activity close to Pt/C, high catalytic current density as well as excellent methanol tolerance and durability. Importantly, as cathode catalyst for Zn-air battery, N, P-NC also exhibits current and power densities comparable to the state-of-the art 20% Pt/C. Therefore, such a facile, scalable and high-yield synthesis of N, P-codoped nanoporous carbon materials opens up opportunities for the mass-production of highly efficient cost-effective electrocatalysts for energy applications.

The main results are an extension of the compound invariance of Li-Yorke chaos and distributional chaos. New definitions of (F-1, F-2)-scrambled sets in non-autonomous discrete systems are given. For a positive integer k, the properties P(k) and Q(k) of Furstenberg families are introduced. It is shown that, for any positive integer k, for any s is an element of [0, 1], Furstenberg family (M) over bar (s) has properties P(k) and Q(k), where (M) over bar (s) denotes the family of all infinite subsets of Z(+) whose upper density is not less than s. Then, the following conclusion is obtained. D is an ((M) over bar (s), (M) over bar (t))-scrambled set of (X, f(1,infinity)) if and only if D is an ((M) over bar (s), (M) over bar (t))-scrambled set of (X, f(1,infinity)([m])).

To investigate how urbanization has influenced the extent of soil erosion in Inner Mongolia, we used urbanization and soil erosion data from 2000 through 2010 to determine the relationship between urbanization and soil erosion patterns. Two empirical equations-the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) and the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ)-were used to estimate the intensity of soil erosion, and we performed backward linear regression to model how it changed with greater urbanization. There was an apparent increase in the rate of urbanization and a decrease in the area affected by soil erosion in 2010 compared to the corresponding values for 2000. The urban population stood at 11.32 million in 2010, which represented a 16.47% increase over that in 2000. The area affected by soil erosion in 2000 totaled 704,817 km(2), yet it had decreased to 674,135 km(2) by 2010. However, a path of modest urban development (rural-urban mitigation) and reasonable industrial structuring (the development of GDP-2) may partially reduce urbanization's ecological pressure and thus indirectly reduce the threat of soil erosion to human security. Therefore, to better control soil erosion in Inner Mongolia during the process of urbanization, the current model of economic development should be modified to improve the eco-efficiency of urbanization, while also promoting new modes of urbanization that are environmentally sustainable, cost-effective, and conserve limited resources.

The higher the waveform capture rate is, the larger the chance to capture elusive events is and the more reliable the test result is. First, this paper analyzes the impact of several factors on the waveform capture rate of the system, then the novel technology based on reconfigurable cache is further proposed to optimize system architecture, and the simulation results show that the signal-to-noise ratio of signal, capacity, and structure of cache have significant effects on the waveform capture rate. Finally, the technology is demonstrated by the engineering practice, and the results show that the waveform capture rate of the system is improved substantially without significant increase of system's cost, and the technology proposed has a broad application prospect.

It also has a complicated phase diagram of scientific interest. Here we reported a new allotrope of silicon obtained from crystal structure prediction. Westudied its electronic, vibrational, dielectric, elastic and hardness properties by first-principles calculations. The results indicate that it is an indirect narrow-band-gap semiconductor. It is dynamically stable with a doubly degenerate infrared-active mode at its Brillouin zone center. Born effective charges of the constituent element are very small, resulting in a negligible ionic dielectric contribution. Calculated elasticity-related quantities imply that it is mechanically stable but anisotropic. There exist slowly increasing stages in the stress-strain curves of this crystal, which make it difficult to estimate the hardness of the crystal by calculating its ideal strengths. Taking advantage of the hardness model proposed by Simunek, we obtained a value of 12.0 GPa as its hardness. This value is lower than that of the cubic diamond-structural Si by about 5.5%.

Herein, Titanium Carbide (Ti3C2) MXene modified by alkali treatment process was selected as a support (designated as alk-Ti3C2X2, where X represents the surface terminations) for the synthesis of Pd/alk-Ti3C2X2. Results show that the alkali treatment leads to the increase of surface area and surface oxygen-containing groups of Ti3C2X2, thereby facilitating the dispersion and stabilization of Pd species on the surface of alk-Ti3C2X2. The Pd/alk-Ti3C2X2 catalyst shows excellent catalytic activity for the hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol and the hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol in aqueous solution at 25 degrees C and hydrogen balloon pressure. High initial reaction rates of 216.6 and 126.3 min(-1).g(pd)(-1) observed for the hydrodechlorination of 4-chlorophenol and hydrogenation of 4-nitrophenol, respectively. Most importantly, Pd/alk-Ti3C2X2 exhibits excellent stability and recyclability in both reactions without any promoters. The superior property of Pd/alk-Ti3C2X2 makes it as a potential material for practical applications.

The traditional experimental method has a common disadvantage in that it only can measure dust concentration of a few sampling points, resulting in limitation of further research about the distribution law of dust concentration in cement workshops. Aimed at revealing more visually and accurately the distribution law of dust concentration, a vision-based measurement (VBM) system for dust concentration based on the image transmission is constructed by utilizing an established dust simulation device in cement workshops. The measurement system measured the dust concentration in the X and Z directions with a line-scanning measuring mode and that of end face XOZ in a face-scanning measuring mode. Experimental results show that the distribution law of dust concentration can be regarded as a first exponential function and then oscillating function relationship between the dust concentration and the distance from the dust source in the X direction, a parabolic function between the dust concentration and the distance from the dust source in the Z direction, and a type of laminar or turbulence distribution in the end face XOZ. The proposed VBM and the revealed law can provide a reference for the study of dust concentration distribution and dust control. (C) 2017 Optical Society of America.

In recent years, several protocols based on bilinear pairing and elliptic curve cryptosystem have been presented. However, their security are based on the discrete logarithm on elliptic curve, which has been proven unsafe by the emergence of quantum computers. To address the issue, we propose a new lightweight AHA scheme based on the number theory research unit public key cryptosystem for wireless networks. Security analysis and simulation experiment results show that in addition to achieving mutual authentication and greater security to resist known attacks, the proposed protocol has lower implementation complexity in comparison with up-to-date handover authentication schemes.

To develop appropriate public policies and ensure sound business investment decisions, both government administrations and private sector businesses use basic tourist demand forecasting to plan future operations and assess the need for facilities and infrastructure investment. Therefore, forecasting has become indispensable to tourism management. This study proposes a combined tourism forecasting model using an artificial neural network (ANN) and a clustering algorithm, which considers two aspects of the given data series: sequence patterns and near characteristics, which embody structural changes and time series correlations. Training data were clustered into homogenous groups, and for each cluster, a dedicated forecaster was employed. Several neighboring samples were then selected to capture the current changes in the data series trends. Finally, the two prediction results derived from the sequence patterns and near characteristics were combined to determine the final forecast results. To verify the superiority and accuracy of the proposed model, it was compared with three other ANN-based models and the most popular ARIMA model using three non-linear, non-stationary tourist arrivals data series. Experimental cases studies demonstrated that the proposed combination method consistently outperformed the other related methods. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

However, conventional sparse representation-based super-resolution aim at learning a universal and efficient dictionary pair for image representation. However, considering that a large number of different structures exist in an image, it is insufficient and unreasonable to present various image structures with only one universal dictionary pair. In this paper, we propose an improved fuzzy clustering and weighted scheme reconstruction framework to solve this problem. Firstly, the training patches are divided into multiple clusters by joint learning multiple dictionary pairs with improved fuzzy clustering method. The goal of joint learning is to learn the multiple dictionary pairs which could collectively represent all the training patches with smallest reconstruction error. So that the learned dictionary pairs are more precise and mutually complementary. Then, high-resolution (HR) patches are estimated according to several most accurate dictionary pairs. Finally, these estimated HR patches are integrated together to generate a final HR patch by a weighted scheme. Numerous experiments demonstrate that this framework outperforms some state-of-art super-resolution methods in both quantitatively and perceptually.

Here, a hyper-cross-linked polymer (HCP-PPh3), which was synthesized through the Friedel-Crafts reaction of benzene and triphenylphosphine, was employed as a support to stabilize Rh NPs. The characterization results revealed that the Rh NPs were uniformly dispersed on the surface of HCP-PPh3, and that they had an average particle size of 2.1 nm. The as-prepared HCP-PPh3-Rh was used as an active catalyst for hydrogen generation from AB hydrolysis. This catalyst exhibited a high turnover frequency of 481 mol H-2 (mol(Rh) min)(-1) for AB hydrolysis under mild conditions. The high catalytic performance of HCP-PPh3-Rh can be attributed to the small size of Rh NPs and the strong interaction between the metal and HCP-PPh3. This work highlights a potentially powerful strategy for preparing highly active HCP stabilized metal NPs for AB hydrolysis to generate hydrogen.

Oxygen was selectively reduced to H2O2 combined with electrochemical corrosion of zinc in the Zn-CNTs-O-2 system. The ratio of zinc and CNTs, heat treatment temperature, and operational parameters such as composite dosage, initial pH, solution temperature, oxygen flow rate were systematically investigated to improve the efficiency of H2O2 generation. The Zn-CNTs composite (weight ratio of 2.5:1) prepared at 500 degrees C showed the maximum H2O2 accumulation concentration of 293.51 mg L-1 within 60 min at the initial pH value of 3.0, Zn-CNTs dosage of 0.4 g and oxygen flow rate of 400 mL min(-1). The oxygen was reduced through two-electron pathway to hydrogen peroxide on CNTs while the zinc was oxidized in the system and the dissolved zinc ions convert to zinc hydroxide and depositing on the surface of CNTs. It was proposed that the increment of direct H2O2 production was caused by the improvement of the formed Zn/CNTs corrosion cell. This provides promising strategy for in situ synthesis and utilization of hydrogen peroxide in the novel Zn-CNTs-O-2 system, which enhances the environmental and economic attractiveness of the use of H2O2 as green oxidant for wastewater treatments.

It crystallizes in the orthorhombic space group Ama2 (no. 40). In the structure of K-2[B3O3(OH)(5)], the BO2(OH) triangles and BO2(OH)(2) tetrahedra are linked via sharing corners forming the isolated [B3O3(OH)(5)](2-) anionic groups with no dangling bonds in oxygen atoms. And K-2[B3O3(OH)(5)] is the first synthetic noncentrosymmetric borates with [B3O3(OH)(5)](2-) anionic groups. Powder second-harmonic generation (SHG) using the Kurtz Perry technique showed that K-2[B3O3(OH)(5)] is type I phasematchable, and the measured SHG coefficient is 0.32 times that of KH2PO4. The UV transmittance spectroscopy measurement indicated that the UV absorption edge was below 200 nm, suggesting that K-2[B3O3(OH)(5)] might be a promising deep-UV nonlinear optical material. Band structure and optical property calculations based on DFT methods were also performed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Peculiar effect of rare earth doping on magnetic and magnetocaloric properties in Fe-rich amorphous ribbons	JOURNAL OF ALLOYS AND COMPOUNDS			English	Article						Amorphous ribbon; Rare earth; Magnetocaloric effect; Universal curve	ROOM-TEMPERATURE; ALLOYS; REFRIGERATION; TRANSITION; NB	We report the influence of rare-earth doping on magnetic and magnetocaloric properties of Fe82R-E4B4Mn4Zr4Nb2 (RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd) ribbons prepared by melt-spinning method. The amorphous structure of the ribbons has been examined by X-ray diffraction technique. Temperature dependence of the magnetization shows that the Curie temperature is changeable in the RE-doped ribbons. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements indicate that the ribbons exhibit excellent thermal stability at room temperature. The ribbons show large magnetocaloric effect in a broad temperature range. Taking a temperature span of 60 K, the values of refrigeration capacity with a field change of 3 T are found to be 119, 87, 120, 115, 81 J/kg for RE = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Gd, respectively. Universal behavior is observed in the isothermal entropy change curves for each sample with different field changes, and the curves for all the samples with the same field change.

Using a numerically exact method based on the thermofield dynamics theory and the matrix product states, we obtain exact evolutions of the TLS and bath (environment) under repetitive measurements at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we observe a transition from a pure QZE in the short time scale to a QZE-QAZE crossover in the long time scale by considering the measurement-induced non-Markovian effect. At finite temperature, we exploit that the thermal fluctuation suppresses the decay of the survival probability in the short time scale, whereas it enhances the decay in the long time scale.

Targeted photonic routers with chiral photon-atom interactions	PHYSICAL REVIEW A			English	Article							NANOPHOTONIC WAVE-GUIDE; QUANTUM-DOT; SINGLE PHOTONS; EMITTER	The photonic router is a key device in optical quantum networks. Conventional routers, however, can only transfer a photon from the input port to the desired port probabilistically. Here, we propose to use chiral photon-atom interactions for targeted routing that can transfer a single photon from the input port to an arbitrarily selected output port deterministically, i.e., with 100% probability. The configuration of the proposed router consists of a driven three-level atom which is chirally coupled to two photonic waveguides simultaneously. It is shown that, by properly adjusting the driving field on the atom, a single photon inputting from one port of the first waveguide can be deterministically transferred to one of the selected output ports of the second waveguide. Both resonant and nonresonant photons can be deterministically routed to the desired ports. We also examine how the routing fidelity is influenced by dissipations and imperfections, and investigate the transmission characters of two resonant photons.

This problem is formulated as a multi objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming model to maximize the lowest victims' perceived satisfaction, and minimize respectively the largest deviation on victims' perceived satisfaction for all demand points and sub-phases. Then, genetic algorithm is proposed to solve this mathematical model. To validate the proposed methodologies, a case study from Wenchuan earthquake is illustrated. Computational results demonstrate genetic algorithm here can achieve the trade-off between solution quality and computation time for relief distribution with the concern of sustainability. Furthermore, it indicates that the methodology provides the tools for decision-makers to optimize the structure of relief distribution network and inventory, as well as alleviate the suffering of victims. Increasingly, this paper expects to not only validate the proposed model and method, but also highlight the importance and urge of considering beneficiary perspective on sustainability into relief distribution problem.

J	Zhou, JH; Chang, HR				Zhou, Jianhui; Chang, Hao-Ran			Dynamical correlation functions and the related physical effects in three-dimensional Weyl/Dirac semimetals	PHYSICAL REVIEW B			English	Article							NEGATIVE MAGNETORESISTANCE	We present a unified derivation of the dynamical correlation functions including density-density, density-current and current-current, of three-dimensional Weyl/Dirac semimetals by use of the Passarino-Veltman reduction scheme at zero temperature. The generalized Kramers-Kronig relations with arbitrary order of subtraction are established to verify these correlation functions. Our results lead to the exact chiral magnetic conductivity and directly recover the previous ones in several limits. We also investigate the magnetic susceptibilities, the orbital magnetization, and briefly discuss the impact of electron interactions on these physical quantities within the random phase approximation. Our work could provide a starting point for the investigation of the nonlocal transport and optical properties due to the higher-order spatial dispersion in three-dimensional Weyl/Dirac semimetals.

In this Letter, we report on the development of ultrathin CoFe-borate layer coated CoFe-layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets array supported on Ti mesh (CoFe-Bi@CoFe-LDH NA/TM) as a high-active 3D catalyst electrode at near-neutral pH for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). In 0.1 M K2B4O7 solution (K-Bi, bulk pH: 9.2), such CoFe-Bi@CoFe-LDH NA/TM displays superior catalytic activity with small overpotential of 418 mV for 10 mA cm(-2). In addition, such catalyst electrode also exhibits superior long-period electrochemical activity and durability for OER and a relatively high turnover frequency (TOF) of 0.482 mol O-2 s(-1) achieved at overpotential of 600 mV.

The addition of alcohol effectively reduces the grain size of the materials and simultaneously leads to the surprising enhancement of the UC emission. The increase in the volume ratio of EtOH/H2O causes the transformation of the crystal structure of the materials from hexagonal to cubic phase. The particle size of the material with the EtOH/H2O of 2:1 is almost 1000 times smaller than that of the material without EtOH, and the strongest luminescence is observed at the EtOH/H2O of 2:1. The type of alcohol in the solvent exhibits a significant influence on the luminescent properties of the materials. The NaYF4:Yb/Er nanocrystals obtained using different alcohols as solvent possess much a smaller grain size and stronger upconversion luminescence than that using water as solvent, and the NaYF4:Yb/Er materials with n-propyl alcohol exhibit the strongest luminescence intensity. The mechanism of the reduction of grain size and enhancement in the luminescence of the NaYF4:Yb3+, Er3+ upconversion materials has been proposed. This study may suggest a simple method to significantly reduce the grain size and improve the upconversion luminescence properties of NaYF4-based fluorescence material.

In this work, a new lead-free system of (1-x)BaTiO3-xCaHfO(3) was designed, and characterized by a coexistence of ferroelectric rhombohedral-orthorhombic-tetragonal (R-O-T) phases. With the increase amount of CaHfO3 (x), a stable coexistence region of three ferroelectric phases (R-O-T) exists at 0.06 <= x <= 0.08. Both large piezoelectric coefficient (d(33) similar to 400 pC/N), inverse piezoelectric coefficient (d(33)* similar to 547 pm/V) and planar electromechanical coupling factor (k(p) similar to 58.2%) can be achieved for the composition with x = 0.08 near the coexistence of three ferroelectric phases. Our results show that the materials with the composition located at a region where the three ferroelectric R-O-T phases coexist would have the lowest energy barrier and thus greatly promote the polarization rotation, resulting in a strong piezoelectric response.

The success of waste management decisions directly lies in the accuracy and reliability of the data on which choices are based; many factors influence these data. Here, we examined the factors influencing domestic waste in rural areas of developing countries (RADIC), using both field surveys and by reviewing previous literature. The social factors included population, education and culture. There was a positive linear relationship between waste generation amount and population size (R-2 = 0.9405). Environmental education, training and demonstration projects played a positive role in improving people's awareness of the benefits of recycling and reducing waste. Traditional and national cultures, consumption and living habits contributed to variations in the generation and composition of domestic waste. Generally, practices related to conservation of and reverence for nature and green consumption encourage people to reduce, reuse and recycle waste in their daily life. Economic factors included household income and expenditure, energy and fuel structure, and types of industry that occurred in villages. A Kuznets inverted "U" curve relationship existed between domestic waste generation and people's income in rural areas of China. However, the waste generation rate had a linear relationship with the gross national income per capita in RADIC. The composition, bulk density and calorific value of domestic waste were variously affected by the energy and fuel structure and the types of industry that occurred. The natural factors included geography and climate (including rainfall, humidity, temperature and harvest seasons). The moisture content of waste was directly influenced by rainfall and humidity. Temperature affected waste characteristics by influencing residential heating modes. The waste characteristics were also influenced by the mixing of agricultural and aquacultural waste into domestic waste in the harvesting season. In different geographies, significant differences of domestic waste characteristics were observed as a result of comprehensive effects caused by multiple factors. Other factors included the administrative levels of communities and survey methods. The characteristics of domestic waste in towns or central villages were similar with those in cities, but were different from those in common villages (the smallest type of community). The domestic waste sampled in households indicated a lower rate of generation and lower ash content than when the waste was sampled at transfer stations or dumping sites. Based on the above analysis, the factors influencing domestic waste must be considered in order to optimize the design of waste management strategies in the RADIC. Furthermore, it is valuable and important to obtain more accurate data about waste characteristics. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Firstly, we adopt the concept of intuitionistic fuzzy sets, interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets and picture fuzzy sets. Secondly, we develop some similarity measures between picture fuzzy sets, such as, cosine similarity measure, weighted cosine similarity measure, set-theoretic similarity measure, weighted set-theoretic cosine similarity measure, grey similarity measure and weighted grey similarity measure. Then, we apply these similarity measures between picture fuzzy sets to building material recognition and minerals field recognition. Finally, two illustrative examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the similarity measures for building material recognition and minerals field recognition.	[Wei, G.

Herein, efficient hydrogen evolution from AB hydrolysis over the carbon-supported Rh nanoparticles synthesized with sodium citrate (Rh/C-SC) was achieved at 25 degrees C. The turnover frequency value of Rh/C-SC was 336 mol H-2 (mol(Rh) min)(-1), whereas that of Rh/C catalyst only yielded a value of 134 mol H-2 (mole(Rh) min)(-1). The improvement of the catalytic performance of Rh/C-SC catalyst could be attributed to the small Rh particles with highly active surface areas, which were prepared by using sodium citrate as the stabilizing agent. This result indicates that sodium citrate can be applied as a useful stabilizing agent for synthesizing active metal nanoparticles, thus highly promoting the practical application of AB system for fuel cells.

In this work, we predicted a tetragonal carbon allotrope formed by five-membered carbon cages. We studied its electronic, vibrational, dielectric, elastic, hardness and ideal strengths using first principles calculation. The results indicate that it is dynamically stable but higher in energy than graphite. It is a semiconductor having both Raman and infrared vibrational modes in its Brillouin zone center. Calculated dielectric properties reveal that it is an electronic dielectric material. It is mechanically stable but has a noticeable elastic anisotropy. Investigations of the ideal strengths indicate that c axis is more resistant against tension than a axis, but it is reversed in the case of compression. The minimum ideal strength is about 42.5/40.0 GPa occurring in the [010](100) slip system, which agrees well with the calculated hardness 41.2/39.2 GPa, so it may be a superhard material. The related fracture mechanisms at the critical strains were also discussed and illustrated by maps of electron density difference.

First, an adaptive decorrelation NLMS algorithm is presented to reduce the computational complexity of the existing decorrelation NLMS scheme. Then, by introducing a norm constraint on the decorrelation filter taps, the weight-constraint decorrelation NLMS (WCDNLMS) method is proposed. Third, on the WCDNLMS basis, a combination scheme of two weight-constraint decorrelation filters is developed to obtain an appropriate decorrelation parameter in different stages, i.e., large norm at transient state and small norm upon convergence. In addition, by extending the filter combination to adaptive networks, the diffusion combined weight-constraint decorrelation NLMS algorithm is devised for distributed estimation with colored inputs, and its theoretical performance is also analyzed. Finally, computer simulations are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms and agreement with theoretical calculations.s	[Zhang, Sheng] Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611756, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [So, Hing Cheung] City Univ Hong Kong, Dept Elect Engn, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China; [Mi, Wen] Univ Elect & Technol Sci China, Sch Math Sci, Chengdu 610051, Sichuan, Peoples R China; [Han, Hongyu] Sichuan Normal Univ, Sch Comp Sci, Chengdu 610068, Sichuan, Peoples R China	Zhang, S (reprint author), Southwest Jiaotong Univ, Sch Informat Sci & Technol, Chengdu 611756, Sichuan, Peoples R China.	dr.s.zhang@ieee.org; hcso@ee.cityu.edu.hk; mathmw@uestc.edu.cn; hyhan@my.swjtu.edu.cn	Zhang, Sheng/AAE-3571-2019		National Natural Science Foundation of ChinaNational Natural Science Foundation of China [11401079]	This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 11401079.

However, in small cells with closed subscriber group (CSG) mode, how to motivate small cell base stations (SBSs) to adopt ABS schemes is still one of technical challenges due to the selfish nature of SBSs. In this paper, we propose a pricing framework with ABS scheme that benefit both the macrocell and small cell tier. Within the proposed framework, each SBS with closed access policy performs ABS scheme by muting a portion of the whole frame in time domain, and then dedicating this interference-free subframe to macrocell users (MUs) for exclusive use. In return, the macrocell base station (MBS) announces the price for these ABSs and offers a certain amount of revenue to each SBS according to the length of its ABS. Furthermore, we extend the small cell performance analysis to the scenario of hybrid access policy, which allow neighboring MUs to access small cells. To investigate the interaction between two tiers, we formulate the proposed framework as a one-leader multiple-follower Stackelberg game, which regards the MBS and SBSs as leader and followers, respectively. On the basis of the theoretical analysis, we prove that a unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) exists and obtain the optimal strategies for both tiers. Numerical results evaluate the utility performance of both tiers when SE is achieved and verify the validity of the proposed framework.

The detection of Zn was based on a headspace-solid phase extraction (HS-SPE), visible fluorescence from the AuNCs coated paper was quenched by ZnH2 generated from hydride generation (HG). The potential mechanism was investigated by using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). The selectivity was significantly increased because the zinc hydride was effectively separated from sample matrices by hydride generation. A limit of detection (LOD) of 3 mu gL(-1) Zn2+ and a relative standard deviation (RSD, n = 7) of 2% at a concentration of 50 mu gL(-1) of Zn2+ were obtained when using a commercial fluorescence spectrophotometer as the detector. In visual detection, as low as 20 mu gL(-1) of Zn2+ in biological samples can be easily discriminated from the blank with the naked eye. The proposed method retains several unique advantages, including straightforward, rapid, affordable and equipment-free for visual detection. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, the existing FHE schemes are still not being put into the practical applications due to their low efficiency. Therefore, it is imperative to find a more efficient FHE scheme or to optimize the existing FHE schemes so that they can be put into the practical applications. In this paper, we optimize GSW scheme by using the parallel computing, and finally we get a high-performance FHE scheme, namely PGSW scheme. Experimental results show that the time overhead of the homomorphic operations in new FHE scheme will be reduced manyfold with the increasing of processing units number. Therefore, our scheme can greatly reduce the running time of homomorphic operations and improve the performance of FHE scheme through sacrificing hardware resources. It can be seen that our FHE scheme can catalyze the development of FHE.

The catalyst was characterized by SEM, EDS, TEM, XRD and XPS. The reaction between Zn-Fe-CNTs and O-2 in aqueous solution could generate H2O2 in situ, which was further transferred to (OH)-O-center dot. The Fenton like degradation of sulfamethoxazole (SMX) using Zn-Fe-CNTs as catalyst was evaluated. The results indicated that Zn-Fe-CNTs had a coral porous structure with a BET area of 51.67 m(2)/g, exhibiting excellent adsorption capacity for SMX, which enhanced its degradation. The particles of Zn-0 and Fe-0/Fe2O3 were observed on the surface of Zn-Fe-CNTs. The mixture of Zn-0 and CNTs could reduce O-2 into H2O2 by micro electrolysis and Fe-0/Fe2O3 could catalyze in-situ generation of H2O2 to produce (OH)-O-center dot through Fenton-like process. When initial pH = 1.5, T = 25 degrees C, O-2 flow rate = 400 mL/min, Zn-Fe-CNTs = 0.6 g/L, SMX = 25 mg/L and reaction time = 10 min, the removal efficiency of SMX and TOC was 100% and 51.3%, respectively. The intermediates were detected and the possible pathway of SMX degradation and the mechanism of Zn-Fe-CNTs/O-2 process were tentatively proposed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

We propose multiscale influence measures for examining the influence of individual markets on other markets and on the entire system. We find (i) that the cross-correlations, net cross-correlations, and net influences among the five gold markets vary across time scales, (ii) that the cross-market correlation between London and New York at each time scale is intense and inherent, meaning that the influence of other gold markets on the London-New York market is negligible, (iii) that the remaining cross-market correlations (i.e., those other than London-New York) are greatly affected by other gold markets, and (iv) that the London gold market significantly affects the other four gold markets and dominates the world-wide gold market. Our multiscale findings give market participants and market regulators new information on cross-market linkages in the world-wide gold market. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

However, less is known about factors that cause individual differences in perseverance. We tested the role of a specific philosophical belief among laypersons the belief in free will in predicting perseverance among two Chinese adolescent cohorts attending high school. In Study 1 (N = 1262), self-reported belief in free will was associated with stronger perseverance for long-term goals, as measured by the Grit-S scale. In Study 2 (N = 710), we first successfully replicated the association between self-reported belief in free will and perseverance. Then, we categorized the participants into free will believers and determinism believers by a two-alternative forced choice philosophical question regarding the existence of free will. Free will believers scored higher in perseverance than did determinism believers. Taken together, our study implied that the belief in free will is one crucial predictor of perseverance for long-term goals.

The coating of LiCoO2 has a significant effect on the electrochemical performance of the spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4-based cathode material, especially the cycling stability at high temperature and rate capability. After modification, the ionic conductivity of the material is greatly improved due to the high ion conductivity of LiCoO2. The LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4@ LiCoO2 with 1% LiCoO2 presents the optimal rate capability and delivers a relatively high discharge capacity of 122 mA h g(-1) at 10C. On the other hand, the surface coating of LiCoO2 can effectively facilitate Li+ interfacial diffusion, and alleviate the side reactions between the active material and the electrolyte; as a result, the capacity retention of 96.17% for the LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4@ LiCoO2 electrode with 1% LiCoO2 is much higher than that for the bare LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (74.93%) after 100 cycles at elevated temperature. Our study confirms that the core-shell structure construction caused by the coating of LiCoO2 plays a critical role in the improvement of the electrochemical cycling stability at elevated temperatures and rate capability.

In this work, a semiconductor of LaFeO3 was coated on the surface of polyhedral LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 via a wetchemical method. LaFeO3 coated at the surface of LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 significantly protects the cathode from the corrosion of HF and alleviates the dissolution of Mn ions into organic liquid electrolyte during (dis) charge processes. The 2.0 wt% LaFeO3-coated LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 cathode exhibits much better cycling stability, rate capability, and elevated temperature stability than the pristine: capacity retention of 97.71% at 1 C after 100 cycles vs. that of 90.96%; rate capability of 111.9 and 99.6 mAh g(-1) at high C-rates of 5 C and 10 C vs. that of 90.6 and 76.4 mAh g(-1), respectively; and high temperature capacity retention of 93.29% at 1 C after 100 cycles vs. that of 69.9%. Present study provides a facile method to mitigate the dissolution of Mn ions into electrolyte for LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, resulting in excellent cycling performance and rate capability.

J	Jie, WJ; Hao, JH				Jie, Wenjing; Hao, Jianhua			Time-dependent transport characteristics of graphene tuned by ferroelectric polarization and interface charge trapping	NANOSCALE			English	Article							FIELD-EFFECT TRANSISTORS; HYBRID STRUCTURES; HYSTERESIS; TRANSPARENT; ELECTRODES; BEHAVIOR	Graphene-based field effect transistors (FETs) were fabricated by employing ferroelectric Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3) O-3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) as a gate insulator. The co-existing effects of ferroelectric gating and interface charge trapping on the transport properties of graphene were investigated with respect to the FET structure. The sheet resistance (Rs) of graphene shows a slight decay under a small applied voltage, which is much less than the coercive voltage of the ferroelectric PMN-PT, suggesting non-negligible charge trapping effects. Moreover, when the applied voltage is increased up to a value larger than the coercive voltage, Rs exhibits three states: an initial rapid change, followed by a slow nearly exponential evolution, and finally a saturated state either during the applied voltage is retained or after it is released. In particular, a high-resistance state is finally reached due to the ferroelectric gating, implying that ferroelectric effects dominate this process. The underlying physical mechanism was fully investigated to effectively address the observed evolution of time-dependent Rs. Such a finding provides us an opportunity to understand the co-existing effects of ferroelectric gating and charge trapping and tune the transport properties of graphene through the interface effects.

To probe the molecular self-assembly and mesophase properties, the length and rigid spacers in diazide have been tailored. The tetramers 7 with a soft spacer display a room-temperature enantiotropic DLC mesophase, and X-ray diffraction confirms that they exhibit an unusual mesophase of a lamellar-hexagonal columnar phase (Colhl). The results of the photophysical tests show that all the new H-shaped DLC tetramers display relatively high intensity photoluminescence properties.

To overcome these problems, a novel superconducting magnetic energy storage-fault current limiter (SMES-FCL)-based protection scheme by modified control of superconducting coil (SC) and rotor-side converter (RSC) is investigated here. A rotor-side mathematical model is used to estimate and optimise the SC inductance parameter. Two modified control strategies of SMES-FCL cooperative operation and positive-sequence d-q current modification (PCM) are proposed to control the SC and RSC for enhancing the transient stability of the overall DFIG system. In addition to maintaining good FRT performance from the SMES-FCL on stabilising the electromagnetic torque, DC-link voltage, active and reactive power, and stator and rotor current during grid fault, the PCM control is also demonstrated in the simulations to suppress the transient oscillations and thus to shorten the recovery time after grid fault. Meanwhile, compared with conventional SMES-FCL scheme, the requirement of SC current capacity is much lowered for smoothing the DFIG output power under a varying wind speed condition and for enhancing the FRT performance under a grid fault condition.

We find that the scattered field and the particulate collection satisfy two Fourier relations, i.e. the spectral density is directly proportional to a Fourier transform of a convolution of correlation coefficient of each particle and correlation coefficient of distribution function of the whole collection, and the spectral degree of coherence is directly proportional to a Fourier transform of a convolution of strength of the scattering potential of each particle and strength of the distribution function of the whole collection. To illustrate these relations, behaviors of the far-field generated by Gaussian-correlated particles with Gaussian-correlated distributions have been discussed.

In this work, we demonstrated a fluorescent turn-off mode DNA assay based on l-cysteine-modulated synthesis of CdTe quantum dots (CdTe QDs), horseradish peroxidase-mimicking G-quadruplex-hemin-K+ complex controlled oxidation of l-cysteine to cystine, and catalyzed hairpin assembly (CHA)-assisted signal amplification. After the addition of target DNA, the CHA signal amplification reaction was triggered and numerous H1-H2 double-stranded DNA were formed, initiating the release of G-quadruplex sequences in H2 simultaneously. Thus, the degree of inhibition of the synthesis of CdTe QDs is proportional to the concentration of the G-quadruplex sequence in this method. In contrast, when the target DNA was absent, the CHA could not be triggered, and the fluorescence signal was high due to the remaining intact l-cysteine. Under optimal experimental conditions, the homogeneous fluorescence method achieved the detection of HIV DNA with a linear range from 0.1 pM to 1 nM and a detection limit of 0.12 pM. This novel biosensor exhibits excellent specificity in differentiating DNA sequences with a single-base and two-base mismatch. To the best of our knowledge, this a label-free and highly sensitive bioassay utilizing CHA-assisted signal amplification and G-quadruplex control of in situ synthesis of CdTe QDs strategy was not reported in previous. Thus, this proposed strategy is anticipated to find use in basic biochemical research and clinical diagnosis.

To date, several studies focused on PSY genes in the context of abiotic stress responses. In this study, two phytoene synthase encoding genes, IbPSY1 and IbPSY2, were identified from a published transcriptome and bioinformatic analysis showed that they shared conserved domains with phytoene synthases from other plants. The IbPSY1 gene was cloned and carefully characterized. Digital gene expression profiling (DGE) showed that the highest transcription level of IbPSY1 was in young leaves, and the lowest level was in stems. In vivo expression levels of IbPSY1 under abiotic stress were observed to be highest in stems at day 11. Over-expression of IbPSY1 in Escherichia coli and yeast cells endowed the cells with better growth under salt and drought stress than the control cells. This study demonstrated that IbPSY1 not only played an important role in vivo, but also in E. coli and yeast to improve tolerance to salinity and drought stress. Thus, IbPSY1 may be aid in the development of transgenic plants with enhanced stress tolerance.

Co-culture of specific beta-CY- and 3-PBA-degrading microorganisms can simultaneously degrade both compounds. In this study, we determined the microorganisms capable of complete degradation of both beta-CY and 3-PBA in co-culture. We found that Bacillus licheniformis B-1 and Aspergillus oryzae M-4 efficiently degraded beta-CY and 3-PBA, respectively, and further elucidated the interaction between these two strains. beta-CY and 3-PBA degradation by strains B-1 and M-4 increased by 26.77% and 39.04% after addition of 2 mL of the filtrate from the monoculture of strain M-4 and the supernatant from the monoculture of strain B-1, respectively. Furthermore, the yields of strains B-1 and M-4 in co-culture and monocultures were almost at the same order of magnitude, indicating that the interaction between these two strains was not antagonistic or competitive. At media and inocula ratios of 2:1 (v/v) in co-culture of strains B-1 and M-4, beta-CY (100 mg L-1) and 3-PBA were completely degraded after 96 h. The results provided a promising approach for the efficient biodegradation of pyrethroids and their associated metabolites.

The samples were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and thermal conductivity measurements. The results demonstrate that during the sintering process, the exchange of metal ions between the mixture powders introduced lattice defects into the MgO lattice structure, and an MgO-CoO solid solution was formed. Compared to commercial semi-sintered MgO pressure-transmitting medium (SSMPM), the temperature-generation efficiency of MCOPM-17 (MgO+17mol% CoO) improved by about 220% at the high pressure of 12GPa with a cell assembly in a two-stage multi-anvil large volume press. Moreover, the thermal conductivity of CoO-doped MgO decreased with increasing CoO doping.

J	Gao, H; Wei, GW; Huang, YH				Gao, Hui; Wei, Guiwu; Huang, Yuhan			Dual Hesitant Bipolar Fuzzy Hamacher Prioritized Aggregation Operators in Multiple Attribute Decision Making	IEEE ACCESS			English	Article						Multiple attribute decision making (MADM); Bipolar fuzzy set; Dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy set; Dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized weighted average (DHBFHPWA) operator; dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized weighted geometric (DHBFHPWG) operator	RELATIONAL ANALYSIS METHOD; SIMILARITY MEASURES; DIAGNOSTIC-ANALYSIS; CROSS-ENTROPY; INFORMATION; SETS; WEIGHTS; NUMBERS; MODELS; SYSTEM	In this paper, we investigate the dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems in which there exists a prioritization relationship over attributes. Then, motivated by the idea of Hamacher operations and prioritized aggregation operators, we have developed some Hamacher prioritized aggregation operators for aggregating dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy information: dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized average operator, dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized geometric operator, dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized weighted average operator, dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy Hamacher prioritized weighted geometric operator. Then, we have utilized these operators to develop some approaches to solve the dual hesitant bipolar fuzzy multiple attribute decision making problems. Finally, a real-world example is then analyzed to illustrate the relevance and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.
